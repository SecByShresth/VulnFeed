# 🛡️ VulnFeed  
### CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities & Red Hat Security Dashboard  

A **real-time vulnerability tracker** that monitors actively exploited CVEs from **CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)** Catalog and **Red Hat Security Advisories**.

---

## 🎯 What is VulnFeed?

**VulnFeed** is a client-side web application that aggregates and displays actively exploited vulnerabilities tracked by the **U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** and critical security advisories from **Red Hat**.  

Unlike traditional CVE databases that list every vulnerability, VulnFeed focuses exclusively on vulnerabilities that are **actively exploited in the wild** and **critical Red Hat security updates**.
