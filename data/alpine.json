When using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption.

is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a \"proper\" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks.

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository.

is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, when cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files on the same filesystem as the target repository in the `objects/` directory. Cloning a local repository over the filesystem may creating hardlinks to arbitrary user-owned files on the same filesystem in the target Git repository's `objects/` directory. When cloning a repository over the filesystem (without explicitly specifying the `file://` protocol or `--no-local`), the optimizations for local cloning\nwill be used, which include attempting to hard link the object files instead of copying them. While the code includes checks against symbolic links in the source repository, which were added during the fix for CVE-2022-39253, these checks can still be raced because the hard link operation ultimately follows symlinks. If the object on the filesystem appears as a file during the check, and then a symlink during the operation, this will allow the adversary to bypass the check and create hardlinks in the destination objects directory to arbitrary, user-readable files. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and

is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When Git asks for credentials via a terminal prompt (i.e. without using any credential helper), it prints out the host name for which the user is expected to provide a username and/or a password. At this stage, any URL-encoded parts have been decoded already, and are printed verbatim. This allows attackers to craft URLs that contain ANSI escape sequences that the terminal interpret to confuse users e.g. into providing passwords for trusted Git hosting sites when in fact they are then sent to untrusted sites that are under the attacker's control. This issue has been patch via commits `7725b81` and `c903985` which are included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.2, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3, v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4.

is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. Git defines a line-based protocol that is used to exchange information between Git and Git credential helpers. Some ecosystems (most notably, .NET and node.js) interpret single Carriage Return characters as newlines, which renders the protections against CVE-2020-5260 incomplete for credential helpers that treat Carriage Returns in this way. This issue has been addressed in commit `b01b9b8` which is included in release versions v2.48.1, v2.47.2, v2.46.3, v2.45.3, v2.44.3, v2.43.6, v2.42.4, v2.41.3, and v2.40.4.

is a Rust package manager. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not perform SSH host key verification when cloning indexes and dependencies via SSH. An attacker could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-46176. All Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 are vulnerable. Note that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternate registry indexes or crate dependencies, you might be affected by this vulnerability if you have configured git to replace HTTPS connections to GitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), as that'd cause you to clone the crates.io index through SSH. Rust 1.66.1 will ensure Cargo checks the SSH host key and abort the connection if the server's public key is not already trusted.

is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files. Prior to 1.6.52, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in libpng's simplified API allows reading up to 1012 bytes beyond the png_sRGB_base[512] array when processing valid palette PNG images with partial transparency and gamma correction.

Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.24.1 is vulnerable to possible domain hijack attacks. Promiscuous NS RRSets that complement positive DNS replies in the authority section can be used to trick resolvers to update their delegation information for the zone. Usually these RRSets are used to update the resolver's knowledge of the zone's name servers. A malicious actor can exploit the possible poisonous effect by injecting NS RRSets (and possibly their respective address records) in a reply. This could be done for example by trying to spoof a packet or fragmentation attacks. Unbound would then proceed to update the NS RRSet data it already has since the new data has enough trust for it, i.e., in-zone data for the delegation point. Unbound 1.24.1 includes a fix that scrubs unsolicited NS RRSets (and their respective address records) from replies mitigating the possible poison effect. Unbound 1.24.2 includes an additional fix that scrubs unsolicited NS RRSets (and their respective address records) from YXDOMAIN and non-referral nodata replies, further mitigating the possible poison

Additionally, to successfully execute the attack, the user must scan through the stream, making web live stream content (such as web radios) a very unlikely attack vector.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mpg123","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mpg123?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.32.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.1-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.3-r0","1.13.1-r0","1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.6-r0","1.13.8-r0","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.3-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.15.1-r0","1.15.3-r0","1.15.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.0-r1","1.17.0-r0","1.18.0-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.19.0-r0","1.20.0-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.1-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.23.1-r0","1.23.3-r0","1.23.5-r0","1.23.6-r0","1.23.7-r0","1.23.8-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.12-r0","1.25.13-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.4-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.7-r0","1.25.8-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.3-r0","1.26.3-r1","1.26.4-r0","1.26.5-r0","1.27.0-r0","1.27.2-r0","1.28.0-r0","1.28.1-r0","1.28.2-r0","1.29.0-r0","1.29.1-r0","1.29.2-r0","1.29.3-r0","1.30.0-r0","1.30.1-r0","1.30.2-r0","1.31.0-r0","1.31.1-r0","1.31.2-r0","1.31.2-r1","1.31.3-r0","1.31.3-r1","1.32.1-r0","1.32.2-r0","1.32.3-r0","1.32.4-r0","1.32.5-r0","1.32.6-r0","1.32.7-r0","1.6.4-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.9.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-10573.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mpg123","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mpg123?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.32.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.1-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.3-r0","1.13.1-r0","1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.6-r0","1.13.8-r0","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.3-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.15.1-r0","1.15.3-r0","1.15.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.0-r1","1.17.0-r0","1.18.0-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.19.0-r0","1.20.0-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.1-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.23.1-r0","1.23.3-r0","1.23.5-r0","1.23.6-r0","1.23.7-r0","1.23.8-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.12-r0","1.25.13-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.4-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.7-r0","1.25.8-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.3-r0","1.26.3-r1","1.26.4-r0","1.26.5-r0","1.27.0-r0","1.27.2-r0","1.28.0-r0","1.28.1-r0","1.28.2-r0","1.29.0-r0","1.29.1-r0","1.29.2-r0","1.29.3-r0","1.30.0-r0","1.30.1-r0","1.30.2-r0","1.31.0-r0","1.31.1-r0","1.31.2-r0","1.31.2-r1","1.31.3-r0","1.31.3-r1","1.32.1-r0","1.32.2-r0","1.32.3-r0","1.32.4-r0","1.32.5-r0","1.32.6-r0","1.32.7-r0","1.6.4-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.9.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-10573.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mpg123","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mpg123?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.32.8-r0"}]}],"versions":["1.10.0-r0","1.10.1-r0","1.12.1-r0","1.12.1-r1","1.12.3-r0","1.13.1-r0","1.13.2-r0","1.13.3-r0","1.13.4-r0","1.13.6-r0","1.13.8-r0","1.14.1-r0","1.14.2-r0","1.14.3-r0","1.14.4-r0","1.15.1-r0","1.15.3-r0","1.15.4-r0","1.16.0-r0","1.16.0-r1","1.17.0-r0","1.18.0-r0","1.18.1-r0","1.19.0-r0","1.20.0-r0","1.20.1-r0","1.21.0-r0","1.22.0-r0","1.22.1-r0","1.22.3-r0","1.22.4-r0","1.23.1-r0","1.23.3-r0","1.23.5-r0","1.23.6-r0","1.23.7-r0","1.23.8-r0","1.24.0-r0","1.25.0-r0","1.25.1-r0","1.25.10-r0","1.25.11-r0","1.25.12-r0","1.25.13-r0","1.25.2-r0","1.25.4-r0","1.25.5-r0","1.25.6-r0","1.25.7-r0","1.25.8-r0","1.26.0-r0","1.26.1-r0","1.26.2-r0","1.26.3-r0","1.26.3-r1","1.26.4-r0","1.26.5-r0","1.27.0-r0","1.27.2-r0","1.28.0-r0","1.28.1-r0","1.28.2-r0","1.29.0-r0","1.29.1-r0","1.29.2-r0","1.29.3-r0","1.30.0-r0","1.30.1-r0","1.30.2-r0","1.31.0-r0","1.31.1-r0","1.31.2-r0","1.31.2-r1","1.31.3-r0","1.31.3-r1","1.32.1-r0","1.32.2-r0","1.32.3-r0","1.32.4-r0","1.32.5-r0","1.32.6-r0","1.32.7-r0","1.6.4-r0","1.7.2-r0","1.7.3-r0","1.8.1-r0","1.8.1-r1","1.9.0-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2024-10573.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-10573"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-26T12:33:38.527604Z","source":"alpine","ecosystem":"Alpine"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2024-10977","published":"2024-11-14T13:15:04.023Z","modified":"2025-12-03T23:04:55.373449Z","upstream":["CVE-2024-10977"],"details":"Client use of server error message in PostgreSQL allows a server not trusted under current SSL or GSS settings to furnish arbitrary non-NUL bytes to the libpq application.

through 2.1.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.1, in certain scenarios involving applications that try to rely on efficient copying of file data, can replace file contents with zero-valued bytes and thus potentially disable security mechanisms. NOTE: this issue is not always security related, but can be security related in realistic situations. A possible example is cp, from a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version, when attempting to preserve a rule set for denying unauthorized access.

In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing.

summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow remote\nrecovery of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on 64 bit\nARM platforms.\n\nImpact summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64 bit\nARM platforms could allow recovering the private key by an attacker..\n\nWhile remote key recovery over a network was not attempted by the reporter,\ntiming measurements revealed a timing signal which may allow such an attack.\n\nOpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS, and so\nthis CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts.  However, given that it is\npossible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled\nwith the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be\nrecoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderate\nseverity issue.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as SM2 is not an approved

summary: An application trying to decrypt CMS messages encrypted using\npassword based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.\n\nImpact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a

The out-of-bounds write can cause\na memory corruption which can have various consequences including\na Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.\n\nAlthough the consequences of a successful exploit of this vulnerability\ncould be severe, the probability that the attacker would be able to\nperform it is low. Besides, password based (PWRI) encryption support in CMS\nmessages is very rarely used.

mismatch caused by client-triggered server-sent stream resets between HTTP/2 specifications and the internal architectures of some HTTP/2 implementations may result in excessive server resource consumption leading to denial-of-service (DoS).  By opening streams and then rapidly triggering the server to reset them—using malformed frames or flow control errors—an attacker can exploit incorrect stream accounting. Streams reset by the server are considered closed at the protocol level, even though backend processing continues. This allows a client to cause the server to handle an unbounded number of concurrent streams on a single connection.

multi-vendor cache poisoning vulnerability named 'Rebirthday Attack' has been discovered in caching resolvers that support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS). Unbound is also vulnerable when compiled with ECS support, i.e., '--enable-subnet', AND configured to send ECS information along with queries to upstream name servers, i.e., at least one of the 'send-client-subnet', 'client-subnet-zone' or 'client-subnet-always-forward' options is used. Resolvers supporting ECS need to segregate outgoing queries to accommodate for different outgoing ECS information.

tails":"The PCRE2 library is a set of C functions that implement regular expression pattern matching. In version 10.45, a heap-buffer-overflow read vulnerability exists in the PCRE2 regular expression matching engine, specifically within the handling of the (*scs:...) (Scan SubString) verb when combined with (*ACCEPT) in src/pcre2_match.c. This vulnerability may potentially lead to information disclosure if the out-of-bounds data read during the memcmp affects the final match result in a way observable by the attacker.

MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.20","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-49601.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.21","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-49601.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.22","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0","3.6.3.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-49601.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mbedtls","ecosystem":"Alpine:v3.23","purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/mbedtls?arch=source"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.4-r0"}]}],"versions":["2.0.0-r0","2.1.2-r0","2.11.0-r0","2.12.0-r0","2.14.1-r0","2.16.0-r0","2.16.1-r0","2.16.1-r1","2.16.10-r0","2.16.10-r1","2.16.12-r0","2.16.12-r1","2.16.2-r0","2.16.3-r0","2.16.5-r0","2.16.6-r0","2.16.8-r0","2.16.9-r0","2.2.0-r0","2.2.0-r1","2.2.1-r0","2.28.0-r0","2.28.1-r0","2.28.1-r1","2.28.2-r0","2.28.3-r0","2.28.3-r1","2.28.3-r2","2.28.3-r3","2.28.4-r0","2.28.5-r0","2.28.6-r0","2.28.7-r0","2.28.8-r0","2.3.0-r0","2.4.0-r0","2.4.1-r0","2.4.2-r0","2.5.1-r0","2.6.0-r0","2.6.1-r0","2.7.0-r0","3.6.0-r0","3.6.1-r0","3.6.2-r0","3.6.3-r0","3.6.3.1-r0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/alpine/ALPINE-CVE-2025-49601.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-49601"}],"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-26T12:33:38.568588Z","source":"alpine","ecosystem":"Alpine"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"ALPINE-CVE-2025-49794","published":"2025-06-16T16:15:18.997Z","modified":"2025-12-03T22:59:38.618982Z","upstream":["CVE-2025-49794"],"details":"A use-after-free vulnerability was found in libxml2.

is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location.

is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. The wincred credential helper uses a static buffer (target) as a unique key for storing and comparing against internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds check the available space remaining in the buffer before appending to it with wcsncat(), leading to potential buffer overflows. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and

is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and

Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable.
