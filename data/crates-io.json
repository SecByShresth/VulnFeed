Prior to v4.0.0, the validation that this `chip_ordering` correctly provides these indexes was missing. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by adding a check that the indexed chip’s name is equal to the name stored in the verifying key’s chip information. \n\nIn the recursive verifier, every verifier program is generated beforehand and later checked for correctness by requiring a merkle proof to the precomputed merkle root of valid verifier keys. Therefore, the recursive verifier and the on-chain verifier were not affected by this vulnerability. \n\nThis code was audited twice, once as a part of the audit by KALOS and once by Cantina for v1.0.0. This bug was found by the Succinct team during preparation of v4.0.0. Out of abundance of caution, we will be deprecating all previous versions and freeze the corresponding verifiers.\n\nFurthermore, in the recursive verifier, the `is_complete` boolean flag is used to flag a proof of complete execution. Prior to v4.0.0, this flag was underconstrained in parts of our recursive verifier, such as the first layer of the recursion. In v4.0.0, this bug was fixed by adding appropriate calls to the `assert_complete` function, which constrains the correctness of the `is_complete` flag. This code was a part of the audit for v3.0.0. This bug affects the soundness of the Rust SDK for verifying compressed proofs, and the soundness of on-chain verifier for deferred proofs. \n\nThis issue was found by a combined effort from Aligned, LambdaClass and 3MI Labs, and was also independently found by Succinct during the preparation of v4.0.0. \n\nLastly, SP1’s STARK verifier relied on logic inside Plonky3, one SP1's core dependencies, to check that the polynomial evaluation claims are correct using a FRI-based polynomial commitment scheme. To batch this check, multiple polynomial evaluation claims are combined using a random linear combination. Prior to v4.0.0, the individual evaluation claims were not observed into the challenger before sampling the coefficient for the random linear combination. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by observing all the evaluation claims into the challenger correctly inside of Plonky3.\n\nThis bug was found by Lev Soukhanov and Onur Kilic, and we have worked closely with the Plonky3 team to mitigate this vulnerability. We will be deprecating all previous versions and freezing their verifiers to ensure that versions with the vulnerability will not be used in production.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sp1-stark","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/sp1-stark"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/security/advisories/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-01-15T21:25:54Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.537824Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj","published":"2024-12-11T21:47:37Z","modified":"2024-12-11T21:48:32Z","summary":"PQClean has a correctness error in HQC decapsulation","details":"### Impact\n\nA correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism.

If you obtained a HQC implementation from PQClean, please update to a version that includes the fixes proposed in https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578. \n\nPlease also [refer to our security policy](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nManually patching is always possible\n\n### Further details\n\nIn the 2023/04/30 version of the HQC specification and reference implementation, an extra field (sigma) was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts. The logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation function was not updated accordingly. As a result, sigma is treated as part of the public key. Later in the decapsulation call, a incorrectly constructed comparison check allows this error to go through undetected. Due to how these two bugs interfere with each other, the decapsulation function never uses sigma to perform implicit rejection; instead, it accepts malformed ciphertexts and returns shared secrets based on their decryptions.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue was first reported in OQS https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7. The vulnerability was identified by Célian Glénaz and Dahmun Goudarzi (Quarkslab).\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pqcrypto-hqc","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/pqcrypto-hqc"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj/GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/security/advisories/GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rustpq/pqcrypto/commit/0c07fa8badbf44f67d3ff1571df31ca54e5228c0"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1240","CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-12-11T21:47:37Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.528982Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f","published":"2024-03-29T18:30:42Z","modified":"2024-11-29T05:36:46.040549Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-29640"],"summary":"aliyundrive-webdav vulnerable to Command Injection","details":"An issue in aliyundrive-webdav v.2.3.3 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the sid parameter in the `action_query_qrcode` component.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"aliyundrive-webdav","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/aliyundrive-webdav"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.3.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f/GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f.json"}},{"package":{"name":"aliyundrive-webdav","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/aliyundrive-webdav"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.3.3"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.14","0.1.15","0.1.16","0.1.17","0.1.18","0.1.19","0.1.2","0.1.20","0.1.21","0.1.22","0.1.23","0.1.24","0.1.25","0.1.26","0.1.27","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.4.6","0.4.7","0.4.8","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.5.5","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.11.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.7.4","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.9.0","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f/GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29640"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lakemoon602/vuln/blob/main/detail.md"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/messense/aliyundrive-webdav"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/messense/aliyundrive-webdav/blob/main/openwrt/luci-app-aliyundrive-webdav/luasrc/controller/aliyundrive-webdav.lua"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://aliyundrive-webdav.com"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-29T20:14:34Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-03-29T17:15:12Z","severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.528781Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q89g-4vhh-mvvm","published":"2022-06-17T00:16:48Z","modified":"2024-03-15T00:05:18.748750Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-45713","CVE-2021-45714","CVE-2021-45715","CVE-2021-45716","CVE-2021-45717","CVE-2021-45718","CVE-2021-45719","GHSA-4qr3-m7ww-hh9g","GHSA-87xh-9q6h-r5cc","GHSA-92cx-4xm7-jr9m","GHSA-cm8g-544f-p9x9","GHSA-f6f2-3w33-54r9","GHSA-g4g4-3pqw-8m7f","GHSA-g87r-23vw-7f87","RUSTSEC-2021-0128"],"summary":"Incorrect Lifetime Bounds on Closures in `rusqlite`","details":"The lifetime bound on several closure-accepting `rusqlite` functions (specifically, functions which register a callback to be later invoked by SQLite) was too relaxed.

macro can cause UB when `Enum` trait is incorrectly implemented","details":"Affected versions of this crate did not properly check the length of an enum when using `enum_map!` macro, trusting user-provided length.\n\nWhen the `LENGTH` in the `Enum` trait does not match the array length in the `EnumArray` trait, this can result in the initialization of the enum map with uninitialized types, which in turn can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\nThis problem can only occur with a manual implementation of the Enum trait, it will never occur for enums that use `#[derive(Enum)]`.\n\nExample code that triggers this vulnerability looks like this:\n\n```rust\nenum E {\n    A,\n    B,\n    C,\n}\n\nimpl Enum for E {\n    const LENGTH: usize = 2;\n\n    fn from_usize(value: usize) -> E {\n        match value {\n            0 => E::A,\n            1 => E::B,\n            2 => E::C,\n            _ => unimplemented!(),\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn into_usize(self) -> usize {\n        self as usize\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<V> EnumArray<V> for E {\n    type Array = [V; 3];\n}\n\nlet _map: EnumMap<E, String> = enum_map! { _ => \"Hello, world!\".into() };\n```\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit [b824e23](https://github.com/xfix/enum-map/commit/b824e232f2fb47837740070096ac253df8e80dfc) by putting `LENGTH` property on sealed trait for macro to

They are both valid. But when generating the block template, if the fee rate of B is higher, it comes before A, which will invalidate A. Currently the RPC `get_block_template` will fail instead of dropping A.\n\n### Patch\n\nFirst, the `get_block_template` should not fail but dropping the conflict transactions.\n\nThen we can propose solution to this issue. Here is an example. When a transaction is added to the pool, the pool must consider it depending on all the transactions which dep cell (direct or indirect via dep group) has been destroyed in this transaction. Because future transactions using the destroyed cells as dep will be rejected, the spending transaction only need to wait for all the existing dep transactions on chain.\n\n### Workaround\n\n1. Submit transaction B when A is already on chain.\n2. Let B depend on A explicitly, there are several solutions:\n    * a. Add any output cell on A as a dep cell or input in B.\n    * b. Merge A and B. CKB allows using the same cell as both dep and input in the same transaction.\n3.

Binary Protocol Misinterpretation caused by Truncating or Overflowing Casts","details":"The following presentation at this year's DEF CON was brought to our attention on the SQLx Discord:\n\n> SQL

 \n> (Archive link for posterity.)\n\nEssentially, encoding a value larger than 4GiB can cause the length prefix in the protocol to overflow, \ncausing the server to interpret the rest of the string as binary protocol commands or other data.\n\nIt appears SQLx _does_ perform truncating casts in a way that could be problematic, \nfor example: <https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/6f2905695b9606b5f51b40ce10af63ac9e696bb8/sqlx-postgres/src/arguments.rs#L163>\n\nThis code has existed essentially since the beginning, \nso it is reasonable to assume that all published versions `<= 0.8.0` are affected.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAs always, you should make sure your application is validating untrustworthy user input. \nReject any input over 4 GiB, or any input that could _encode_ to a string longer than 4 GiB. \nDynamically built queries are also potentially problematic if it pushes the message size over this 4 GiB bound.\n\n[`Encode::size_hint()`](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/trait.Encode.html#method.size_hint) \ncan be used for sanity checks, but do not assume that the size returned is accurate. \nFor example, the `Json<T>` and `Text<T>` adapters have no reasonable way to predict or estimate the final encoded size, \nso they just return `size_of::<T>()` instead.\n\nFor web application backends, consider adding some middleware that limits the size of request bodies by default.\n\n## Resolution\n\nWork has started on a branch to add `#[deny]` directives for the following Clippy lints:\n\n* [`cast_possible_truncation`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_truncation)\n* [`cast_possible_wrap`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_wrap)\n* [`cast_sign_loss`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_sign_loss)\n\nand to manually

As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.\n\nDetails\n\nverify_dnskey_rrset() will return Ok(true) if any record's public key matches a trust anchor. This results in verify_rrset() returning a Secure proof. This ultimately results in successfully verifying a response containing DNSKEY records. verify_default_rrset() looks up DNSKEY records by calling handle.lookup(), which takes the above code path. There's a comment following this that says \"DNSKEYs were already validated by the inner query in the above lookup\", but this is not the case. To fully verify the whole RRset of DNSKEYs, it would be necessary to check self-signatures by the trusted key over the other keys. Later in verify_default_rrset(), verify_rrset_with_dnskey() is called multiple times with different keys and signatures, and if any call succeeds, then its Proof is returned.\n\nSimilarly, verify_dnskey_rrset() returns Ok(false) if any DNSKEY record is covered by a DS record. A comment says \"If all the keys are valid, then we are secure\", but this is only checking that one key is authenticated by a DS in the parent zone's delegation point. This time, after control flow returns to verify_rrset(), it will call verify_default_rrset(). The special handling for DNSKEYs in verify_default_rrset() will then call verify_rrset_with_dnskey() using each KSK DNSKEY record, and if one call succeeds, return its Proof.

If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, update them accordingly.\n4. Check the updated wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and ensure you see 1.5.8, 2.0.6, 2.1.5 or 2.2.2.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nThe patch is consensus breaking and requires a coordinated upgrade.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis issue was found by meadow101 who reported

derivation method instantiated with certain curves may allow attacker to find derivation path which results into very long derivation (possible DoS)","details":"### Impact\n<!-- _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_ -->\n\n**Impacted are the only ones who use [`hd_wallet::Slip10Like`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/0.5.1/hd_wallet/struct.Slip10Like.html) or [`slip_10`](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/) derivation method instantiated with curves other than secp256k1 and secp256r1.**\n\n`hd_wallet` crate used to provide `Slip10Like` derivation method, which is also provided in `slip-10` crate as a default derivation method. It's based on [slip10](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md) method that searches for a valid child key in an infinite loop until it's found.\n\nTheoretically, this could be exploited by an attacker by finding a derivation path that would force someone to execute a lot of iterations of this loop to find a valid child key. This attack, however, requires the probability of getting an invalid scalar from random 32 bytes to be high. Slip10 is protected from this attack as it's only defined on secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves, for which such probability is very low:\n\n- For secp256k1, probability is $< 2^{-127}$. This means that a loop with 2 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n- For secp256r1, probability is $< 2^{-32}$. This means that a loop with 5 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n\nWhile standard curves are safe to use with slip10, we used to allow slip10-like derivation which can be instantiated with any curve. For instance, one could instantiate it with ed25519 or stark curves, for which probability of getting invalid scalar from random 32 bytes is >90%, so theoretically, attacker could try to DoS such construction.\n\n### Patches\n<!-- _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_ -->\n\n`hd_wallet v0.6.0` has been patched by removing slip10-like derivation from public API.\n\nIf you need HD derivation on other curves than secp256k1 and secp256r1, we suggest you to use:\n* [`hd_wallet::Edwards`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/latest/hd_wallet/edwards/struct.Edwards.html) derivation method available for ed25519 curve\n* [`hd_wallet::Stark`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/latest/hd_wallet/stark/struct.Stark.html) derivation method available for stark curve\n\nBoth derivation methods are non-standard, but secure and efficient.\n\n**If you're still using `slip_10`** and would like to migrate to patched version, please migrate to `hd_wallet v0.6`. You may first migrate from `slip_10 v0.4` to `hd_wallet v0.5` by following migration instructions available [in the docs](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/), and then upgrade from `hd_wallet v0.5` to `hd_wallet v0.6`.\n\n### Workarounds\nTechnically, you don't need to upgrade if you don't use slip10-like derivation instantiated with other curves than secp256k1 or secp256r1.\n\nHowever, if you do, migrating to other derivation method might be required.\n\n### Reach out to us in Discord\n\nIf you want to reach out to us, feel free to write to [`#lockness` room in Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/905194001349627914/1294284489635139585)\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Alessio Marziali <alessio.marziali@metaco.com> for discovering and flagging this issue","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hd-wallet","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hd-wallet"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r.json"}},{"package":{"name":"slip-10","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/slip-10"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet/security/advisories/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet/commit/a7e37704600ee7c737dbb02db08814dd2d15389d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-12-18T15:51:24Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.516005Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp","published":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","modified":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","summary":"CosmWasm VM Incorrect metering","details":"# CWA-2024-007\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.3\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.4\n- wasmvm < 1.5.5\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.4\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.7\n- cosmwasm-vm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3\n- cosmwasm-vm 1.5.8, 2.0.7, 2.1.4\n\n## Description of the bug\n\n(Blank for now.

If affected versions of the Router receive highly compressed payloads, this could result in significant memory consumption while the compressed payload is expanded. \n\n### Patches\nRouter version 1.40.2 has a fix for the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are unable to upgrade, you may be able to implement mitigations at proxies or load balancers positioned in front of your Router fleet (e.g. Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-native WAF services) by creating limits on HTTP body upload size. \n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apollo-router","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/apollo-router"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.9.5"},{"fixed":"1.40.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/9e9527c73c8f34fc8438b09066163cd42520f413"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-409"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-06T18:24:17Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.538447Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf","published":"2024-03-06T17:04:29Z","modified":"2024-03-06T17:42:13.690789Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-27934"],"related":["CVE-2024-27934"],"summary":"*const c_void / ExternalPointer unsoundness leading to use-after-free","details":"### Summary\n\nUse of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Details\n\n`*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` (defined via `external!()` macros) types are used to represent `v8::External` wrapping arbitrary `void*` with an external lifetime. This is inherently unsafe as we are effectively eliding all Rust lifetime safety guarantees.\n\n`*const c_void` is trivially unsafe. `ExternalPointer` attempts to resolve this issue by wrapping the underlying pointer with a `usize`d marker ([`ExternalWithMarker<T>`](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/blob/a2838062a8f51926140a48a8aa926330c6f9070c/core/external.rs#L49)).\n\nHowever, the marker [relies on the randomness of PIE address (binary base address)](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/blob/a2838062a8f51926140a48a8aa926330c6f9070c/core/external.rs#L10) which is still trivially exploitable for a non-PIE binary. It is also equally exploitable on a PIE binary when an attacker is able to derandomize the PIE address. This is problematic as it escalates an information leak of the PIE address into an exploitable vulnerability.\n\nNote that an attacker able to control code executed inside the Deno runtime is very likely to be able to bypass ASLR with any means necessary (e.g. by chaining another vulnerability, or by using other granted permissions such as `--allow-read` to read `/proc/self/maps`).\n\n\n### PoC\n\nFor simplicity, we use Deno version 1.38.0 where streaming operations uses `*const c_void`. Testing environment is Docker image `denoland/deno:alpine-1.38.0@sha256:fe51a00f4fbbaf1e72b29667c3eeeda429160cef2342f22a92c3820020d41f38` although the exact versions shouldn't matter much if it's in 1.36.2 up to 1.38.0 (before `ExternalPointer` patch, refer Impact section for details)\n\n```js\nconst ops = Deno[Deno.internal].core.ops;\nconst rid = ops.op_readable_stream_resource_allocate();\nconst sink = ops.op_readable_stream_resource_get_sink(rid);\n\n// close\nops.op_readable_stream_resource_close(sink);\nops.op_readable_stream_resource_close(sink);\n\n// reclaim BoundedBufferChannelInner\nconst ab = new ArrayBuffer(0x8058);\nconst dv = new DataView(ab);\n\n// forge chunk contents\ndv.setBigUint64(0, 2n, true);\ndv.setBigUint64(0x8030, 0x1337c0d30000n, true);\n\n// trigger segfault\nDeno.close(rid);\n```\n\nBelow is the dmesg log after the crash. We see that Deno has segfaulted on `1337c0d30008`, which is +8 of what we have written at offset 0x8030. Note also that the dereferenced value will immediately be used as a function pointer, with the first argument dereferenced from offset 0x8038 - it is trivial to use this to build an end-to-end exploit.\n\n```text\n[ 6439.821046] deno[15088]: segfault at 1337c0d30008 ip 0000557b53e2fb3e sp 00007fffd485ac70 error 4 in deno[557b51714000+2d7f000] likely on CPU 12 (core 12, socket 0)\n[ 6439.821054] Code: 00 00 00 00 48 85 c0 74 03 ff 50 08 49 8b 86 30 80 00 00 49 8b be 38 80 00 00 49 c7 86 30 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 48 85 c0 74 03 <ff> 50 08 48 ff 03 48 83 c4 08 5b 41 5e c3 48 8d 3d 0d 1a 59 fb 48\n```\n\nThe same vulnerability exists for `ExternalPointer` implementation, but now it is required for the attacker to either leak the PIE address somehow, or else exploit unexpected aliasing behavior of `v8::External` values. The latter has not been investigated in depth, but it is theoretically possible to alias the same underlying pointer to different `v8::External` on different threads (Workers) and exploit the concurrency (`RefCell` may break this though).\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUse of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.\n\nThis bug is **known to be exploitable** for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations.\n\nAffected versions of Deno is from 1.36.2 up to latest.\n\n- [ext/web/stream_resource.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/ext/web/stream_resource.rs):\n  - `*const c_void` introduced in 1.36.2\n  - Patched into `ExternalPointer` in 1.38.1\n- [ext/http/http_next.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/ext/http/http_next.rs):\n  - `ExternalPointer` introduced in 1.38.2\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.36.2"},{"fixed":"1.40.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-06T17:04:29Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.519214Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3xc6-7h59-j2x4","published":"2024-03-06T00:31:27Z","modified":"2024-03-06T15:34:11Z","withdrawn":"2024-03-06T15:34:11Z","summary":"Duplicate Advisory: eza Potential Heap Overflow Vulnerability for AArch64","details":"## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-3qx3-6hxr-j2ch.

They do though perform an unsafe operation that may not uphold the invariants of the safe function they are in, and could lead to undefined behavior and buffer overreads on malformed input.\n\nThese are of the same nature as those in my previous report about the molecule crate.\n\nPatch attached for commit 1b09e37c8e1b7945495cd18d9782417fbe51e986 that fixes all cases I know of at this time.\n\nPlease consider this report for reward under the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\nRelated advisory: https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/security/advisories/GHSA-rffv-8x7x-p7pw","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ckb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ckb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.31.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.31.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/02/GHSA-q669-2vfg-cxcg/GHSA-q669-2vfg-cxcg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/security/advisories/GHSA-q669-2vfg-cxcg"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/commit/adf8f0d08bc058383a0df658ea2c2ef6e7950335"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-02-02T20:59:17Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.555158Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-x96g-95fq-4xv4","published":"2023-07-18T15:30:36Z","modified":"2023-12-20T23:41:34.819507Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-47085"],"summary":"libostree vulnerable to denial of service attack","details":"An issue was discovered in ostree before version 0.17.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via the print_panic function in repo_checkout_filter.rs.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ostree","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ostree"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.17.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/07/GHSA-x96g-95fq-4xv4/GHSA-x96g-95fq-4xv4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47085"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/issues/2775"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/commit/d9bb160a7c1e7f0a2308a7282622b91bc27d448c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.eprintln.html"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-12-20T23:16:17Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-07-18T14:15:12Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.567342Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-xw5j-gv2g-mjm2","published":"2023-02-14T21:53:37Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:24:34.246767Z","aliases":["RUSTSEC-2023-0014"],"summary":"Miscompilation in cortex-m-rt 0.7.1 and 0.7.2","details":"Version 0.7.1 of the `cortex-m-rt` crate introduced a regression causing the stack to NOT be eight-byte aligned prior to calling `main` (or any other specified entrypoint), violating the [stack ABI of AAPCS32], the default ABI used by all Cortex-M targets.

self.elf_header().section_header_entry_num() as usize;\n    unsafe {\n        let sh_ptr = self.content().as_ptr().add(sh_off);\n        from_raw_parts(sh_ptr as *const ET::SectionHeader, sh_num)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhile this will work perfectly fine *if* the ELF header is valid, malicious or malformed input can contain a section header offset of an arbitrary size, meaning that the resultant pointer in the unsafe block can point to an artibrary address in the address space of the process.\n\nThis can result in unpredictable behaviour, and in our fuzz testing, we discovered that it's trivial to cause SIGABRT (signal 6), or SEGV (signal 11).\n\nThe function should either be marked as unsafe, with a note that the caller is responsible for providing only valid inputs, or it should ideally do the due diligence to ensure that the offset doesn't exceed the bounds of the header (and add additional checks as necessary).\n\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"elf_rs","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/elf_rs"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.3.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/01/GHSA-g6pw-999w-j75m/GHSA-g6pw-999w-j75m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vincenthouyi/elf_rs/issues/11"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vincenthouyi/elf_rs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0079.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-01-20T22:41:01Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:13.542541Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-fq33-vmhv-48xh","published":"2023-04-07T19:23:49Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:19:06.327800Z","aliases":["RUSTSEC-2023-0032"],"summary":"ntru-rs

However, a recent addition to Miri checks that references passed to functions are valid during the entire execution of the function, even when those references are passed inside a struct. This poses an issue for dropping self-referencing values, as the reference becomes invalid during the dropping process. Effectively, since self-referencing structs are not allowed in vanilla Rust, there is no allowance for dropping data during a function that has also been given a reference to that data. There's usually no way to pass a and &a to the same function.\n\nA fix was attempted, where the struct would be turned in to a raw byte array and only transformed back into the underlying data type inside each function. This is allowable as a reference can be created and die over the body of a function, as long as the reference was created inside the function. However, this is also not sound if the original struct contains padding. There is no way to initialize padding bytes to a known value that Miri will accept, so when it is cast to an array some of the bytes contain uninitialized values. This is not acceptable (despite the fact that these bytes are never read) due to the potential for optimizations that may read from the uninitialized bytes.
