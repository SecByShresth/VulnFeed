Prior to v4.0.0, the validation that this `chip_ordering` correctly provides these indexes was missing. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by adding a check that the indexed chip’s name is equal to the name stored in the verifying key’s chip information. \n\nIn the recursive verifier, every verifier program is generated beforehand and later checked for correctness by requiring a merkle proof to the precomputed merkle root of valid verifier keys. Therefore, the recursive verifier and the on-chain verifier were not affected by this vulnerability. \n\nThis code was audited twice, once as a part of the audit by KALOS and once by Cantina for v1.0.0. This bug was found by the Succinct team during preparation of v4.0.0. Out of abundance of caution, we will be deprecating all previous versions and freeze the corresponding verifiers.\n\nFurthermore, in the recursive verifier, the `is_complete` boolean flag is used to flag a proof of complete execution. Prior to v4.0.0, this flag was underconstrained in parts of our recursive verifier, such as the first layer of the recursion. In v4.0.0, this bug was fixed by adding appropriate calls to the `assert_complete` function, which constrains the correctness of the `is_complete` flag. This code was a part of the audit for v3.0.0. This bug affects the soundness of the Rust SDK for verifying compressed proofs, and the soundness of on-chain verifier for deferred proofs. \n\nThis issue was found by a combined effort from Aligned, LambdaClass and 3MI Labs, and was also independently found by Succinct during the preparation of v4.0.0. \n\nLastly, SP1’s STARK verifier relied on logic inside Plonky3, one SP1's core dependencies, to check that the polynomial evaluation claims are correct using a FRI-based polynomial commitment scheme. To batch this check, multiple polynomial evaluation claims are combined using a random linear combination. Prior to v4.0.0, the individual evaluation claims were not observed into the challenger before sampling the coefficient for the random linear combination. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by observing all the evaluation claims into the challenger correctly inside of Plonky3.\n\nThis bug was found by Lev Soukhanov and Onur Kilic, and we have worked closely with the Plonky3 team to mitigate this vulnerability. We will be deprecating all previous versions and freezing their verifiers to ensure that versions with the vulnerability will not be used in production.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sp1-stark","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/sp1-stark"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/security/advisories/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-01-15T21:25:54Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.256020Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj","published":"2024-12-11T21:47:37Z","modified":"2024-12-11T21:48:32Z","summary":"PQClean has a correctness error in HQC decapsulation","details":"### Impact\n\nA correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism. Due to an indexing error, part of the secret key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data. This results in an incorrect shared secret value being returned when the decapsulation function is called with a malformed ciphertext.\n\nNo concrete attack exploiting the error has been identified at this point. However, the error involves mishandling of the secret key, and in principle this presents a security vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nPQClean does not have a release process, as it is a collection of implementations. If you obtained a HQC implementation from PQClean, please update to a version that includes the fixes proposed in https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578. \n\nPlease also [refer to our security policy](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nManually patching is always possible\n\n### Further details\n\nIn the 2023/04/30 version of the HQC specification and reference implementation, an extra field (sigma) was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts. The logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation function was not updated accordingly. As a result, sigma is treated as part of the public key. Later in the decapsulation call, a incorrectly constructed comparison check allows this error to go through undetected. Due to how these two bugs interfere with each other, the decapsulation function never uses sigma to perform implicit rejection; instead, it accepts malformed ciphertexts and returns shared secrets based on their decryptions.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue was first reported in OQS https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7.

The patched versions now produce a compile time error if such a type is marked as `covariant`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"self_cell","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/self_cell"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-48m6-wm5p-rr6h/GHSA-48m6-wm5p-rr6h.json"}},{"package":{"name":"self_cell","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/self_cell"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"1.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-48m6-wm5p-rr6h/GHSA-48m6-wm5p-rr6h.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/issues/49"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0070.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-11-14T18:32:20Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.239479Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3gjh-29fv-8hr6","published":"2024-02-03T00:18:10Z","modified":"2024-02-03T00:18:10Z","summary":"Nervos CKB Snappy decompress length can be very large and causes out of memory error ","details":"### Impact\n\nAdversary can create message which compressed size is less than the package limit but the decompressed length is very large such as 1G.

Binary Protocol Misinterpretation caused by Truncating or Overflowing Casts","details":"The following presentation at this year's DEF CON was brought to our attention on the SQLx Discord:\n\n> SQL Injection isn't Dead: Smuggling Queries at the Protocol Level  \n> <http://web.archive.org/web/20240812130923/https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2032/DEF%20CON%2032%20presentations/DEF%20CON%2032%20-%20Paul%20Gerste%20-%20SQL%20Injection%20Isn't%20Dead%20Smuggling%20Queries%20at%20the%20Protocol%20Level.pdf>  \n> (Archive link for posterity.)\n\nEssentially, encoding a value larger than 4GiB can cause the length prefix in the protocol to overflow, \ncausing the server to interpret the rest of the string as binary protocol commands or other data.\n\nIt appears SQLx _does_ perform truncating casts in a way that could be problematic, \nfor example: <https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/6f2905695b9606b5f51b40ce10af63ac9e696bb8/sqlx-postgres/src/arguments.rs#L163>\n\nThis code has existed essentially since the beginning, \nso it is reasonable to assume that all published versions `<= 0.8.0` are affected.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAs always, you should make sure your application is validating untrustworthy user input. \nReject any input over 4 GiB, or any input that could _encode_ to a string longer than 4 GiB. \nDynamically built queries are also potentially problematic if it pushes the message size over this 4 GiB bound.\n\n[`Encode::size_hint()`](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/trait.Encode.html#method.size_hint) \ncan be used for sanity checks, but do not assume that the size returned is accurate. \nFor example, the `Json<T>` and `Text<T>` adapters have no reasonable way to predict or estimate the final encoded size, \nso they just return `size_of::<T>()` instead.\n\nFor web application backends, consider adding some middleware that limits the size of request bodies by default.\n\n## Resolution\n\nWork has started on a branch to add `#[deny]` directives for the following Clippy lints:\n\n* [`cast_possible_truncation`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_truncation)\n* [`cast_possible_wrap`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_wrap)\n* [`cast_sign_loss`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_sign_loss)\n\nand to manually audit the code that they flag.\n\nA fix is expected to be included in the `0.8.1` release (still WIP as of writing).\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sqlx","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/sqlx"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<=

As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.\n\nDetails\n\nverify_dnskey_rrset() will return Ok(true) if any record's public key matches a trust anchor. This results in verify_rrset() returning a Secure proof. This ultimately results in successfully verifying a response containing DNSKEY records. verify_default_rrset() looks up DNSKEY records by calling handle.lookup(), which takes the above code path. There's a comment following this that says \"DNSKEYs were already validated by the inner query in the above lookup\", but this is not the case. To fully verify the whole RRset of DNSKEYs, it would be necessary to check self-signatures by the trusted key over the other keys. Later in verify_default_rrset(), verify_rrset_with_dnskey() is called multiple times with different keys and signatures, and if any call succeeds, then its Proof is returned.\n\nSimilarly, verify_dnskey_rrset() returns Ok(false) if any DNSKEY record is covered by a DS record. A comment says \"If all the keys are valid, then we are secure\", but this is only checking that one key is authenticated by a DS in the parent zone's delegation point. This time, after control flow returns to verify_rrset(), it will call verify_default_rrset(). The special handling for DNSKEYs in verify_default_rrset() will then call verify_rrset_with_dnskey() using each KSK DNSKEY record, and if one call succeeds, return its Proof. If there are multiple KSK DNSKEYs in the RRset, then this leads to another authentication break. We need to either pass the authenticated DNSKEYs from the DS covering check to the RRSIG validation, or we need to perform this RRSIG validation of the DNSKEY RRset inside verify_dnskey_rrset() and cut verify_default_rrset() out of DNSKEY RRset validation entirely.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hickory-proto","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hickory-proto"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.8.0"},{"fixed":"0.24.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-v7pc-74h8-xq2h/GHSA-v7pc-74h8-xq2h.json"}},{"package":{"name":"hickory-proto","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hickory-proto"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.25.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"0.25.0-alpha.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-v7pc-74h8-xq2h/GHSA-v7pc-74h8-xq2h.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0006.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-345"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-10T21:52:28Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.279666Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-qm2p-4w45-v2vr","published":"2025-02-10T18:07:30Z","modified":"2025-10-28T06:29:25.945179Z","aliases":["RUSTSEC-2025-0005"],"summary":"grcov

The length check of array can only prevent out-of-bound access on the return type. However, it can't prevent misaligned pointer when casting `u8` pointer to a type aligned to larger bytes. For example, if we assign `u16` to `T`, **misaligned raw pointer dereference** could happen and cause to panic. Even if we pass the type aligned to same byte as `u8` (e.g., `bool`), it could construct a illegal type since `bool` can only have 0 or 1 as bit patterns, which is also an undefined behavior.

derivation method instantiated with certain curves may allow attacker to find derivation path which results into very long derivation (possible DoS)","details":"### Impact\n<!-- _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_ -->\n\n**Impacted are the only ones who use [`hd_wallet::Slip10Like`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/0.5.1/hd_wallet/struct.Slip10Like.html) or [`slip_10`](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/) derivation method instantiated with curves other than secp256k1 and secp256r1.**\n\n`hd_wallet` crate used to provide `Slip10Like` derivation method, which is also provided in `slip-10` crate as a default derivation method. It's based on [slip10](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md) method that searches for a valid child key in an infinite loop until it's found.\n\nTheoretically, this could be exploited by an attacker by finding a derivation path that would force someone to execute a lot of iterations of this loop to find a valid child key. This attack, however, requires the probability of getting an invalid scalar from random 32 bytes to be high. Slip10 is protected from this attack as it's only defined on secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves, for which such probability is very low:\n\n- For secp256k1, probability is $< 2^{-127}$. This means that a loop with 2 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n- For secp256r1, probability is $< 2^{-32}$. This means that a loop with 5 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n\nWhile standard curves are safe to use with slip10, we used to allow slip10-like derivation which can be instantiated with any curve. For instance, one could instantiate it with ed25519 or stark curves, for which probability of getting invalid scalar from random 32 bytes is >90%, so theoretically, attacker could try to DoS such construction.\n\n### Patches\n<!-- _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_ -->\n\n`hd_wallet v0.6.0` has been patched by removing slip10-like derivation from public API.\n\nIf you need HD derivation on other curves than secp256k1 and secp256r1, we suggest you to use:\n* [`hd_wallet::Edwards`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/latest/hd_wallet/edwards/struct.Edwards.html) derivation method available for ed25519 curve\n* [`hd_wallet::Stark`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/latest/hd_wallet/stark/struct.Stark.html) derivation method available for stark curve\n\nBoth derivation methods are non-standard, but secure and efficient.\n\n**If you're still using `slip_10`** and would like to migrate to patched version, please migrate to `hd_wallet v0.6`. You may first migrate from `slip_10 v0.4` to `hd_wallet v0.5` by following migration instructions available [in the docs](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/), and then upgrade from `hd_wallet v0.5` to `hd_wallet v0.6`.\n\n### Workarounds\nTechnically, you don't need to upgrade if you don't use slip10-like derivation instantiated with other curves than secp256k1 or secp256r1.\n\nHowever, if you do, migrating to other derivation method might be required.\n\n### Reach out to us in Discord\n\nIf you want to reach out to us, feel free to write to [`#lockness` room in Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/905194001349627914/1294284489635139585)\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Alessio Marziali <alessio.marziali@metaco.com> for discovering and flagging this issue","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hd-wallet","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hd-wallet"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r.json"}},{"package":{"name":"slip-10","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/slip-10"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet/security/advisories/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet/commit/a7e37704600ee7c737dbb02db08814dd2d15389d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-12-18T15:51:24Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.234159Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp","published":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","modified":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","summary":"CosmWasm VM Incorrect metering","details":"# CWA-2024-007\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.3\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.4\n- wasmvm < 1.5.5\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.4\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.7\n- cosmwasm-vm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3\n- cosmwasm-vm 1.5.8, 2.0.7, 2.1.4\n\n## Description of the bug\n\n(Blank for now.

Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` dependency in your go.mod to 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3 depending on which minor version you are; `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, update them accordingly.\n4. Check the updated wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and ensure you see 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 1.5.5, 2.0.4 or 2.1.3.\n\nThe patch is consensus breaking and requires a coordinated upgrade.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis issue was found by meadow101 who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne.\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the\nprogram by reporting a bug, please see <https://hackerone.com/cosmos>.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2024-08-28: Confio receives a report through the Cosmos bug bounty program maintained by Amulet.\n- 2024-08-30: Confio security contributors confirm the report.\n- 2024-09-02: Confio developed the patch internally.\n- 2024-09-23: Patch is released.\n\n[^1]: following Amulet's Severity Classification Framework ACMv1: https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/e0227a1fb4059144aab4f6003eeee7f09912db3a/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.1.0"},{"fixed":"2.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cosmwasm-vm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cosmwasm-vm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.1.0"},{"fixed":"2.1.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cosmwasm-vm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cosmwasm-vm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cosmwasm-vm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cosmwasm-vm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/security/advisories/GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/0e70bd83119b02f99a2c0397f0913e0803750fd9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/16eabd681790508b13dac8e67f9e6e61045240ea"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/commit/f5bf24f3acadca2892afd58cc3ce5fdeb932d492"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/CWAs/CWA-2024-007.md"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.235039Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-vmqh-5232-v43r","published":"2024-12-10T16:55:37Z","modified":"2024-12-10T16:55:37Z","summary":"Panic in wasmvm can slow down block production","details":"# CWA-2024-008\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.3\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.4\n- wasmvm < 1.5.5\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.4\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.7\n- cosmwasm-vm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3\n- cosmwasm-vm 1.5.8, 2.0.7, 2.1.4\n\n## Description of the bug\n\n(Blank for now.

This is inherently unsafe as we are effectively eliding all Rust lifetime safety guarantees.\n\n`*const c_void` is trivially unsafe. `ExternalPointer` attempts to resolve this issue by wrapping the underlying pointer with a `usize`d marker ([`ExternalWithMarker<T>`](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/blob/a2838062a8f51926140a48a8aa926330c6f9070c/core/external.rs#L49)).\n\nHowever, the marker [relies on the randomness of PIE address (binary base address)](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/blob/a2838062a8f51926140a48a8aa926330c6f9070c/core/external.rs#L10) which is still trivially exploitable for a non-PIE binary. It is also equally exploitable on a PIE binary when an attacker is able to derandomize the PIE address. This is problematic as it escalates an information leak of the PIE address into an exploitable vulnerability.\n\nNote that an attacker able to control code executed inside the Deno runtime is very likely to be able to bypass ASLR with any means necessary (e.g. by chaining another vulnerability, or by using other granted permissions such as `--allow-read` to read `/proc/self/maps`).\n\n\n### PoC\n\nFor simplicity, we use Deno version 1.38.0 where streaming operations uses `*const c_void`. Testing environment is Docker image `denoland/deno:alpine-1.38.0@sha256:fe51a00f4fbbaf1e72b29667c3eeeda429160cef2342f22a92c3820020d41f38` although the exact versions shouldn't matter much if it's in 1.36.2 up to 1.38.0 (before `ExternalPointer` patch, refer Impact section for details)\n\n```js\nconst ops = Deno[Deno.internal].core.ops;\nconst rid = ops.op_readable_stream_resource_allocate();\nconst sink = ops.op_readable_stream_resource_get_sink(rid);\n\n// close\nops.op_readable_stream_resource_close(sink);\nops.op_readable_stream_resource_close(sink);\n\n// reclaim BoundedBufferChannelInner\nconst ab = new ArrayBuffer(0x8058);\nconst dv = new DataView(ab);\n\n// forge chunk contents\ndv.setBigUint64(0, 2n, true);\ndv.setBigUint64(0x8030, 0x1337c0d30000n, true);\n\n// trigger segfault\nDeno.close(rid);\n```\n\nBelow is the dmesg log after the crash. We see that Deno has segfaulted on `1337c0d30008`, which is +8 of what we have written at offset 0x8030. Note also that the dereferenced value will immediately be used as a function pointer, with the first argument dereferenced from offset 0x8038 - it is trivial to use this to build an end-to-end exploit.\n\n```text\n[ 6439.821046] deno[15088]: segfault at 1337c0d30008 ip 0000557b53e2fb3e sp 00007fffd485ac70 error 4 in deno[557b51714000+2d7f000] likely on CPU 12 (core 12, socket 0)\n[ 6439.821054] Code: 00 00 00 00 48 85 c0 74 03 ff 50 08 49 8b 86 30 80 00 00 49 8b be 38 80 00 00 49 c7 86 30 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 48 85 c0 74 03 <ff> 50 08 48 ff 03 48 83 c4 08 5b 41 5e c3 48 8d 3d 0d 1a 59 fb 48\n```\n\nThe same vulnerability exists for `ExternalPointer` implementation, but now it is required for the attacker to either leak the PIE address somehow, or else exploit unexpected aliasing behavior of `v8::External` values. The latter has not been investigated in depth, but it is theoretically possible to alias the same underlying pointer to different `v8::External` on different threads (Workers) and exploit the concurrency (`RefCell` may break this though).\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUse of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.\n\nThis bug is **known to be exploitable** for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations.\n\nAffected versions of Deno is from 1.36.2 up to latest.\n\n- [ext/web/stream_resource.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/ext/web/stream_resource.rs):\n  - `*const c_void` introduced in 1.36.2\n  - Patched into `ExternalPointer` in 1.38.1\n- [ext/http/http_next.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/ext/http/http_next.rs):\n  - `ExternalPointer` introduced in 1.38.2\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.36.2"},{"fixed":"1.40.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-06T17:04:29Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.237358Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3xc6-7h59-j2x4","published":"2024-03-06T00:31:27Z","modified":"2024-03-06T15:34:11Z","withdrawn":"2024-03-06T15:34:11Z","summary":"Duplicate Advisory: eza Potential Heap Overflow Vulnerability for AArch64","details":"## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-3qx3-6hxr-j2ch.

A malicious package included as a dependency may inject nearly arbitrary HTML here, potentially leading to XSS if the report is subsequently uploaded somewhere.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is \"low\" for users relying on dependencies from git, local paths, or alternative registries. Users who solely depend on crates.io are unaffected.\n\n\nNote that **by design** Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability in this advisory allows performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros.\n\n# Overview\n\nRust 1.60.0 [introduced](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/04/07/Rust-1.60.0.html#cargo---timings) `cargo build --timings`, which produces a report of how long the different steps of the build process took. It includes lists of Cargo features for each crate.\n\nPrior to Rust 1.72, Cargo feature names were allowed to contain almost any characters (with some exceptions as used by the feature syntax), but it would produce a future incompatibility warning about them [since Rust 1.49](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8814). crates.io is far more stringent about what it considers a valid feature name and has not allowed such feature names.\n\nAs the feature names defined in the `Cargo.toml` file were included unescaped in the timings report, they could be used to inject Javascript into the page.

Plaintext exposed in decrypt_in_place_detached even on tag verification failure","details":"### Summary\nIn the AES GCM implementation of decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted ciphertext (i.e. the correct plaintext) is exposed even if tag verification fails. \n\n### Impact\nIf a program using the `aes-gcm` crate's `decrypt_in_place*` APIs accesses the buffer after decryption failure, it will contain a decryption of an unauthenticated input. Depending on the specific nature of the program this may enable Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs) which can cause a catastrophic breakage of the cipher including full plaintext recovery.\n\n### Details\nAs seen in the implementation of [decrypt_in_place_detached](https://docs.rs/aes-gcm/latest/src/aes_gcm/lib.rs.html#309) for AES GCM, if the tag verification fails, an error is returned. Because the decryption of the ciphertext is done in place, the plaintext contents are now exposed via `buffer`. \n\nThis should ideally not be the case - as noted in page 17 of[ NIST's publication _Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC_](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf): \n_In Step 8, the result of Step 7 is compared with the authentication tag that was received as an input: if they are identical, then the plaintext is returned; otherwise,FAIL is returned._\n\nThis is seems correctly addressed in the [AES GCM SIV implementation](https://docs.rs/aes-gcm-siv/latest/src/aes_gcm_siv/lib.rs.html#307), where the decrypted buffer is encrypted again before the error is returned - this fix is straightforward to implement in AES GCM. To ensure that these types of cases are covered during testing, it would be valuable to add test cases like [23, 24 ](https://github.com/google/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors/aes_gcm_test.json#L288)etc from [project wycheproof ](https://github.com/google/wycheproof)to ensure that when a bad tag is used, there is an error on decryption _**and**_ that the plaintext value is not exposed. \n\n### PoC\nTo reproduce this issue, I'm using [test case 23](https://github.com/google/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors/aes_gcm_test.json#L288) from project wycheproof. \n```rust\n    let key = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f\"));\n    let nonce = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"505152535455565758595a5b\"));\n    let tag = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"d9847dbc326a06e988c77ad3863e6083\")); // bad tag\n    let mut ct = hex!(\"eb156d081ed6b6b55f4612f021d87b39\");\n    let msg = hex!(\"202122232425262728292a2b2c2d2e2f\");\n    let aad = hex!(\"\");\n    let cipher = Aes128Gcm::new(&key);\n    let _plaintext = cipher.decrypt_in_place_detached(&nonce, &aad, &mut ct, &tag);\n    assert_eq!(ct, msg);\n```","affected":[{"package":{"name":"aes-gcm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/aes-gcm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.10.0"},{"fixed":"0.10.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.10.2","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/09/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/security/advisories/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42811"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/aes-gcm/latest/src/aes_gcm/lib.rs.html#309"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ROBB6TBDAGEQ2WIINR34F3DPSN3FND6K"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RYQCICN6BVC6I75O3F6W4VK4J3MOYDJU"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U67ZSMNX5V3WTBYPUYF45PSFG4SF5SGF"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0096.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-09-22T16:11:47Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-09-22T16:15:10Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.238563Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-95qg-89c2-w5hj","published":"2025-12-30T23:45:51Z","modified":"2025-12-31T01:11:16.865808Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-69257"],"summary":"theshit vulnerable to unsafe loading of user-owned Python rules when running as root","details":"### Impact\n\n**Vulnerability Type:** Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) / Arbitrary Code Execution.\n\nThe application loads custom Python rules and configuration files from user-writable locations (e.g., `~/.config/theshit/`) without validating ownership or permissions when executed with elevated privileges.\n\nIf the tool is invoked with `sudo` or otherwise runs with an effective UID of root, it continues to trust configuration files originating from the unprivileged user's environment. This allows a local attacker to\ninject arbitrary Python code via a malicious rule or configuration file, which is then executed with root privileges.\n\n**Who is impacted:**\nAny system where this tool is executed with elevated privileges is affected. In environments where the tool is permitted to run via `sudo` without a password (`NOPASSWD`), a local unprivileged user can escalate privileges to root without additional interaction.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in version **0.1.1**.\n\nThe patch introduces strict ownership and permission checks for all configuration files and custom rules. The application now enforces that rules are only loaded if they are owned by the effective user executing the tool.\n\nWhen executed with elevated privileges (`EUID=0`), the application refuses to load any files that are not owned by root or that are writable by non-root users. When executed as a non-root user, it similarly refuses to load rules owned by other users. This prevents both vertical and horizontal privilege escalation via execution of untrusted code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not possible, users should avoid executing the pplication with `sudo` or as the root user.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, ensure that directories containing custom rules and configuration files are owned by root and are not writable by non-root users. Administrators may also audit existing custom rules before running the tool with elevated privileges.\n\n### Resources\n\n* [Commit fixing the issue](https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/theshit/commit/3dc12905cafb5fd47fff4071a05c231f925ac113)\n* CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n* CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n* CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere","affected":[{"package":{"name":"theshit","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/theshit"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.1.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-95qg-89c2-w5hj/GHSA-95qg-89c2-w5hj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/theshit/security/advisories/GHSA-95qg-89c2-w5hj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69257"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/theshit/commit/8e0b565e7876a83b0e1cfbacb8af39dadfdcc500"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/theshit"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-269"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-30T23:45:51Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-30T20:16:01Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.253050Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-h956-rh7x-ppgj","published":"2025-12-30T23:06:15Z","modified":"2025-12-31T00:58:29.428128Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-68926"],"summary":"RustFS has a gRPC Hardcoded Token Authentication Bypass","details":"## Vulnerability Overview\n\n### Description\n\nRustFS implements gRPC authentication using a hardcoded static token `\"rustfs rpc\"` that is:\n1. **Publicly exposed** in the source code repository\n2. **Hardcoded** on both client and server sides\n3. **Non-configurable** with no mechanism for token rotation\n4. **Universally valid** across all RustFS deployments\n\nAny attacker with network access to the gRPC port can authenticate using this publicly known token and execute privileged operations including data destruction, policy manipulation, and cluster configuration changes.\n\n---\n\n## Vulnerable Code Analysis\n\n### Server-Side Authentication (rustfs/src/server/http.rs:679-686)\n\n```rust\n#[allow(clippy::result_large_err)]\nfn check_auth(req: Request<()>) -> std::result::Result<Request<()>, Status> {\n    let token: MetadataValue<_> = \"rustfs rpc\".parse().unwrap();

This allows bypass of signature verification in cases where coreos-installer decompresses a downloaded OS image, allowing an attacker who can modify the OS image to compromise a newly-installed system.\n\nDefault installations from ISO or PXE media in Fedora CoreOS, RHEL CoreOS, and RHEL for Edge are **not** affected, as coreos-installer installs from an OS image shipped as part of the install media.\n\nThese flows are affected:\n\n1.  Installing with `--image-file`, `--image-url`, or `coreos.inst.image_url`.  For example, if a user has a local mirror of installation images, an attacker could replace an image with a gzip-compressed alternative (even if the file extension is `.xz`).  The result:\n\n    ```\n    $ coreos-installer install --image-url http://localhost:8080/image.xz /dev/loop0\n    Downloading image from http://localhost:8080/image.xz\n    Downloading signature from http://localhost:8080/image.xz.sig\n    > Read disk 749.9 MiB/749.9 MiB (100%)\n    gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Sep 2021 02:41:50 PM EDT\n    gpg: using RSA key 8C5BA6990BDB26E19F2A1A801161AE6945719A39\n    gpg: BAD signature from \"Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>\" [ultimate]\n    Install complete.\n    ```\n\n    Notice that GPG reports a bad signature, but coreos-installer continues anyway.  Automation that relies on coreos-installer's exit status will not notice either.\n\n2. `coreos-installer download --decompress --image-url`:\n\n    ```\n    $ coreos-installer download --decompress --image-url http://localhost:8080/image.xz\n    > Read disk 749.9 MiB/749.9 MiB (100%)\n    gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Sep 2021 02:41:50 PM EDT\n    gpg: using RSA key 8C5BA6990BDB26E19F2A1A801161AE6945719A39\n    gpg: BAD signature from \"Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>\" [ultimate]\n    ./image\n    ```\n\n    Again, coreos-installer reports success.\n\n3. Installing with default parameters, when **not** installing from the image built into live ISO or PXE media, if the hosting service is compromised or if an active attacker gains control of the HTTPS response.\n\n4. `coreos-installer download --decompress` if the hosting service is compromised or if an active attacker gains control of the HTTPS response.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability is [fixed](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/pull/659) in coreos-installer 0.10.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor `coreos-installer download`, do not use the `-d` or `--decompress` options.\n\nFor `coreos-installer install`, manually inspect the stderr output.  If `BAD signature` appears, do not boot from the target disk.

An analysis of all the crates on crates.io was also performed, and no\nother crate with similar code patterns was found.\n\nKeep in mind that the [`rust_decimal`][2] crate was **not** compromised, and it\nis still safe to use.\n\n## Analysis of the crate\n\nThe crate had less than 500 downloads since its first release on 2022-03-25,\nand no crates on the crates.io registry depended on it.\n\nThe crate contained identical source code and functionality as the legit\n`rust_decimal` crate, except for the `Decimal::new` function.\n\nWhen the function was called, it checked whether the `GITLAB_CI` environment\nvariable was set, and if so it downloaded a binary payload into\n`/tmp/git-updater.bin` and executed it. The binary payload supported both Linux\nand macOS, but not for Windows.\n\nAn analysis of the binary payload was not possible, as the download URL didn't\nwork anymore when the analysis was performed.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nIf your project or organization is running GitLab CI, we strongly recommend\nchecking whether your project or one of its dependencies depended on the\n`rustdecimal` crate, starting from 2022-03-25. If you notice a dependency on\nthat crate, you should consider your CI environment to be compromised.\n\nIn general, we recommend regularly auditing your dependencies, and only\ndepending on crates whose author you trust. If you notice any suspicious\nbehavior in a crate's source code please follow [the Rust security\npolicy][3] and report it to the Rust Security Response WG.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe want to thank GitHub user [`@safinaskar`][4] for identifying the\nmalicious crate in [this GitHub issue][1].\n\n[1]: https://github.com/paupino/rust-decimal/issues/514#issuecomment-1115408888\n[2]: https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal\n[3]: https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security\n[4]: https://github.com/safinaskar","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rustdecimal","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/rustdecimal"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["code-execution"],"cvss":null,"informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2022-0042.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/rustdecimal"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0042.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/5DVtC8pgJLw?pli=1"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.304225Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2021-0082","published":"2021-08-14T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-12-17T17:18:32.343835Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-45680","GHSA-jmwx-r3gq-qq3p","GHSA-x76r-966h-5qv9"],"summary":"vec-const attempts to construct a Vec from a pointer to a const slice","details":"Affected versions of this crate claimed to construct a const `Vec` with nonzero length and capacity, but that cannot be done because such a `Vec` requires a pointer from an allocator.\n\nThe implementation was later changed to just construct a `std::borrow::Cow`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vec-const","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/vec-const"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"2.0.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["memory-corruption"],"cvss":null,"informational":"unsound","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2021-0082.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/vec-const"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0082.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Eolu/vec-const/issues/1#issuecomment-898908241"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.299734Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0136","published":"2025-11-07T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-12-17T06:16:23.047289Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-67897","GHSA-v6x3-9r38-r27q"],"summary":"Underflow in aes_key_unwrap function","details":"The `aes_key_unwrap` function would panic if passed a ciphertext\nthat was too short.

It was discovered recently that when we deallocate a node, in some cases only the first memory chunk is deallocated, and the rest of the memory chunks remain (incorrectly) allocated, causing a memory leak.\n\nIn the worst case, depending on how a canister uses the `BTreeMap`, an adversary could interact with the canister through its API and trigger interactions with the map that keep consuming memory due to the memory leak. This could potentially lead to using an excessive amount of memory, or even running out of memory. \n\nThis issue has been fixed in #212 by changing the logic for deallocating nodes to ensure that all of a node's memory chunks are deallocated.

The embedded kernel command line contains a dm-verity hash value that establishes trust in the root file system.\n\nWhen UEFI Secure Boot is disabled, systemd-boot appends any command line it receives to the kernel command line.

This is not sound for shared linear memories, which could be modified in parallel, and this could lead to a data race in the host.\n\nWasmtime has a `wasmtime::Memory` type which represents linear memories in a WebAssembly module. Wasmtime also has `wasmtime::SharedMemory`, however, which represents shared linear memories introduced in the WebAssembly `threads` proposal. The API of `SharedMemory` does not provide accessors which return `&[u8]` in Rust, for example, as that's not a sound type signature when other threads could be modifying memory. The `wasmtime::Memory` type, however, does provide this API as it's intended to be used with non-shared memories where static knowledge is available that no concurrent or parallel reads or writes are happening. This means that it's not sound to represent a shared linear memory with `wasmtime::Memory` and it must instead be represented with `wasmtime::SharedMemory`.\n\nThere were two different, erroneous, methods of creating a `wasmtime::Memory` which represents a shared memory however:\n\n1. The [`wasmtime::Memory::new` constructor](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html#method.new) takes a `MemoryType` which could be `shared`. This function did not properly reject shared memory types and require usage of [`SharedMemory::new`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.SharedMemory.html#method.new) instead.\n2. Capturing a core dump with WebAssembly would expose all linear memories a `wasmtime::Memory`. This means that a core dump would perform an unsynchronized read of shared linear memory, possibly leading to data races.\n\nThis is a bug in Wasmtime's safe Rust API. It should not be possible to cause unsoundness with Wasmtime's embedding API if `unsafe` is not used. Embeddings which do not use the wasm threads proposal nor created shared memories nor actually share shared memories across threads are unaffected. Only if shared memories are created across threads might an embedding be affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch releases have been issued for [all supported versions of Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html), notably: 24.0.5, 36.0.3, 37.0.3, and 38.0.4. These releases reject creation of shared memories via `Memory::new` and shared memories are now excluded from core dumps. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nEmbeddings affected by this issue should use `SharedMemory::new` instead of `Memory::new` to create shared memories. Affected embeddings should also disable core dumps if they are unable to upgrade. Note that core dumps are disabled by default but the wasm threads proposal (and shared memory) is enabled by default. It's recommended to upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime, however.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"38.0.0"},{"fixed":"38.0.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"37.0.0"},{"fixed":"37.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"26.0.0"},{"fixed":"36.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.0.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64345"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/9ebb6934f00d58b92fb68ed0e0b16c0ae828ca10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html#method.new"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.SharedMemory.html#method.new"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v38.0.4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0118.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-362"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-12T21:36:29Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-12T22:15:49Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.263738Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0118","published":"2025-11-11T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-11-13T17:12:30.354190Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-64345","GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q"],"summary":"Unsound API access to a WebAssembly shared linear memory","details":"This is an entry in the RustSec database for the Wasmtime security advisory\nlocated at\nhttps://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q\nFor more information see the GitHub-hosted security advisory.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"24.0.5"},{"introduced":"25.0.0"},{"fixed":"36.0.3"},{"introduced":"37.0.0"},{"fixed":"37.0.3"},{"introduced":"38.0.0"},{"fixed":"38.0.4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2025-0118.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0118.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-02T01:11:41.323514Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q428-6v73-fc4q","published":"2025-11-13T15:36:03Z","modified":"2025-11-13T15:36:03Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-64517"],"summary":"sudo-rs doesn't record authenticating user properly in timestamp","details":"### Summary\nWhen `Defaults targetpw` (or `Defaults rootpw`) is enabled, the password of the target account (or root account) instead of the invoking user is used for authentication. `sudo-rs` prior to 0.2.10 incorrectly recorded the invoking user’s UID instead of the authenticated-as user's UID in the authentication timestamp.

Router incorrectly handled access control directives on interface types/fields and their implementing object types/fields, applying them to interface types/fields while ignoring directives on their implementing object types/fields when all implementations had the same requirements.\n\n## Details\n\nApollo Federation allows users to specify access control directives ([`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/authorization#authorization-directives)) to protect object and interface types and fields. However, the GraphQL specification does not define inheritance rules for directives from interfaces to their implementations.

Truncation Attack against ChaCha20-Poly1305 and Encrypt-then-MAC aka Terrapin","details":"### Summary\n\nTerrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or server noticing it.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nTo mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called \"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.\n\n**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.** \n\nAs a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.\n\n### Details\n\nThe SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode. Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle scenario.\n\nThe attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial key exchange.\n\nIn the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state other than the message's sequence number. In the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR and stream ciphers.\n\nFor more details see [https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com). \n\n### Impact\n\nThis attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle (MitM)
