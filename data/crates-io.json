Prior to v4.0.0, the validation that this `chip_ordering` correctly provides these indexes was missing. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by adding a check that the indexed chip’s name is equal to the name stored in the verifying key’s chip information. \n\nIn the recursive verifier, every verifier program is generated beforehand and later checked for correctness by requiring a merkle proof to the precomputed merkle root of valid verifier keys. Therefore, the recursive verifier and the on-chain verifier were not affected by this vulnerability. \n\nThis code was audited twice, once as a part of the audit by KALOS and once by Cantina for v1.0.0. This bug was found by the Succinct team during preparation of v4.0.0. Out of abundance of caution, we will be deprecating all previous versions and freeze the corresponding verifiers.\n\nFurthermore, in the recursive verifier, the `is_complete` boolean flag is used to flag a proof of complete execution. Prior to v4.0.0, this flag was underconstrained in parts of our recursive verifier, such as the first layer of the recursion. In v4.0.0, this bug was fixed by adding appropriate calls to the `assert_complete` function, which constrains the correctness of the `is_complete` flag. This code was a part of the audit for v3.0.0. This bug affects the soundness of the Rust SDK for verifying compressed proofs, and the soundness of on-chain verifier for deferred proofs. \n\nThis issue was found by a combined effort from Aligned, LambdaClass and 3MI Labs, and was also independently found by Succinct during the preparation of v4.0.0. \n\nLastly, SP1’s STARK verifier relied on logic inside Plonky3, one SP1's core dependencies, to check that the polynomial evaluation claims are correct using a FRI-based polynomial commitment scheme. To batch this check, multiple polynomial evaluation claims are combined using a random linear combination. Prior to v4.0.0, the individual evaluation claims were not observed into the challenger before sampling the coefficient for the random linear combination. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by observing all the evaluation claims into the challenger correctly inside of Plonky3.\n\nThis bug was found by Lev Soukhanov and Onur Kilic, and we have worked closely with the Plonky3 team to mitigate this vulnerability. We will be deprecating all previous versions and freezing their verifiers to ensure that versions with the vulnerability will not be used in production.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sp1-stark","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/sp1-stark"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/security/advisories/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-01-15T21:25:54Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.656236Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj","published":"2024-12-11T21:47:37Z","modified":"2024-12-11T21:48:32Z","summary":"PQClean has a correctness error in HQC decapsulation","details":"### Impact\n\nA correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism.

If you obtained a HQC implementation from PQClean, please update to a version that includes the fixes proposed in https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578. \n\nPlease also [refer to our security policy](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nManually patching is always possible\n\n### Further details\n\nIn the 2023/04/30 version of the HQC specification and reference implementation, an extra field (sigma) was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts. The logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation function was not updated accordingly. As a result, sigma is treated as part of the public key. Later in the decapsulation call, a incorrectly constructed comparison check allows this error to go through undetected. Due to how these two bugs interfere with each other, the decapsulation function never uses sigma to perform implicit rejection; instead, it accepts malformed ciphertexts and returns shared secrets based on their decryptions.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue was first reported in OQS https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7. The vulnerability was identified by Célian Glénaz and Dahmun Goudarzi (Quarkslab).\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pqcrypto-hqc","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/pqcrypto-hqc"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj/GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/security/advisories/GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rustpq/pqcrypto/commit/0c07fa8badbf44f67d3ff1571df31ca54e5228c0"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1240","CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-12-11T21:47:37Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.646847Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f","published":"2024-03-29T18:30:42Z","modified":"2024-11-29T05:36:46.040549Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-29640"],"summary":"aliyundrive-webdav vulnerable to Command Injection","details":"An issue in aliyundrive-webdav v.2.3.3 and before allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted payload to the sid parameter in the `action_query_qrcode` component.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"aliyundrive-webdav","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/aliyundrive-webdav"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.3.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f/GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f.json"}},{"package":{"name":"aliyundrive-webdav","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/aliyundrive-webdav"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"2.3.3"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.10","0.1.11","0.1.12","0.1.13","0.1.14","0.1.15","0.1.16","0.1.17","0.1.18","0.1.19","0.1.2","0.1.20","0.1.21","0.1.22","0.1.23","0.1.24","0.1.25","0.1.26","0.1.27","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.3.2","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.4.3","0.4.4","0.4.5","0.4.6","0.4.7","0.4.8","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.5.3","0.5.4","0.5.5","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.10.0","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.11.0","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.2.6","1.2.7","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.4.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.7.4","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.9.0","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.5","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.2.2","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f/GHSA-73v2-rxqp-7q4f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29640"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lakemoon602/vuln/blob/main/detail.md"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/messense/aliyundrive-webdav"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/messense/aliyundrive-webdav/blob/main/openwrt/luci-app-aliyundrive-webdav/luasrc/controller/aliyundrive-webdav.lua"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://aliyundrive-webdav.com"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-77"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-29T20:14:34Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-03-29T17:15:12Z","severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.646655Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q89g-4vhh-mvvm","published":"2022-06-17T00:16:48Z","modified":"2024-03-15T00:05:18.748750Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-45713","CVE-2021-45714","CVE-2021-45715","CVE-2021-45716","CVE-2021-45717","CVE-2021-45718","CVE-2021-45719","GHSA-4qr3-m7ww-hh9g","GHSA-87xh-9q6h-r5cc","GHSA-92cx-4xm7-jr9m","GHSA-cm8g-544f-p9x9","GHSA-f6f2-3w33-54r9","GHSA-g4g4-3pqw-8m7f","GHSA-g87r-23vw-7f87","RUSTSEC-2021-0128"],"summary":"Incorrect Lifetime Bounds on Closures in `rusqlite`","details":"The lifetime bound on several closure-accepting `rusqlite` functions (specifically, functions which register a callback to be later invoked by SQLite) was too relaxed.

macro can cause UB when `Enum` trait is incorrectly implemented","details":"Affected versions of this crate did not properly check the length of an enum when using `enum_map!` macro, trusting user-provided length.\n\nWhen the `LENGTH` in the `Enum` trait does not match the array length in the `EnumArray` trait, this can result in the initialization of the enum map with uninitialized types, which in turn can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n\nThis problem can only occur with a manual implementation of the Enum trait, it will never occur for enums that use `#[derive(Enum)]`.\n\nExample code that triggers this vulnerability looks like this:\n\n```rust\nenum E {\n    A,\n    B,\n    C,\n}\n\nimpl Enum for E {\n    const LENGTH: usize = 2;\n\n    fn from_usize(value: usize) -> E {\n        match value {\n            0 => E::A,\n            1 => E::B,\n            2 => E::C,\n            _ => unimplemented!(),\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn into_usize(self) -> usize {\n        self as usize\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<V> EnumArray<V> for E {\n    type Array = [V; 3];\n}\n\nlet _map: EnumMap<E, String> = enum_map! { _ => \"Hello, world!\".into() };\n```\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit [b824e23](https://github.com/xfix/enum-map/commit/b824e232f2fb47837740070096ac253df8e80dfc) by putting `LENGTH` property on sealed trait for macro to

They are both valid. But when generating the block template, if the fee rate of B is higher, it comes before A, which will invalidate A. Currently the RPC `get_block_template` will fail instead of dropping A.\n\n### Patch\n\nFirst, the `get_block_template` should not fail but dropping the conflict transactions.\n\nThen we can propose solution to this issue. Here is an example. When a transaction is added to the pool, the pool must consider it depending on all the transactions which dep cell (direct or indirect via dep group) has been destroyed in this transaction. Because future transactions using the destroyed cells as dep will be rejected, the spending transaction only need to wait for all the existing dep transactions on chain.\n\n### Workaround\n\n1. Submit transaction B when A is already on chain.\n2. Let B depend on A explicitly, there are several solutions:\n    * a. Add any output cell on A as a dep cell or input in B.\n    * b. Merge A and B. CKB allows using the same cell as both dep and input in the same transaction.\n3.

Binary Protocol Misinterpretation caused by Truncating or Overflowing Casts","details":"The following presentation at this year's DEF CON was brought to our attention on the SQLx Discord:\n\n> SQL

 \n> (Archive link for posterity.)\n\nEssentially, encoding a value larger than 4GiB can cause the length prefix in the protocol to overflow, \ncausing the server to interpret the rest of the string as binary protocol commands or other data.\n\nIt appears SQLx _does_ perform truncating casts in a way that could be problematic, \nfor example: <https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/6f2905695b9606b5f51b40ce10af63ac9e696bb8/sqlx-postgres/src/arguments.rs#L163>\n\nThis code has existed essentially since the beginning, \nso it is reasonable to assume that all published versions `<= 0.8.0` are affected.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAs always, you should make sure your application is validating untrustworthy user input. \nReject any input over 4 GiB, or any input that could _encode_ to a string longer than 4 GiB. \nDynamically built queries are also potentially problematic if it pushes the message size over this 4 GiB bound.\n\n[`Encode::size_hint()`](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/trait.Encode.html#method.size_hint) \ncan be used for sanity checks, but do not assume that the size returned is accurate. \nFor example, the `Json<T>` and `Text<T>` adapters have no reasonable way to predict or estimate the final encoded size, \nso they just return `size_of::<T>()` instead.\n\nFor web application backends, consider adding some middleware that limits the size of request bodies by default.\n\n## Resolution\n\nWork has started on a branch to add `#[deny]` directives for the following Clippy lints:\n\n* [`cast_possible_truncation`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_truncation)\n* [`cast_possible_wrap`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_wrap)\n* [`cast_sign_loss`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_sign_loss)\n\nand to manually

As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.\n\nDetails\n\nverify_dnskey_rrset() will return Ok(true) if any record's public key matches a trust anchor. This results in verify_rrset() returning a Secure proof. This ultimately results in successfully verifying a response containing DNSKEY records. verify_default_rrset() looks up DNSKEY records by calling handle.lookup(), which takes the above code path. There's a comment following this that says \"DNSKEYs were already validated by the inner query in the above lookup\", but this is not the case. To fully verify the whole RRset of DNSKEYs, it would be necessary to check self-signatures by the trusted key over the other keys. Later in verify_default_rrset(), verify_rrset_with_dnskey() is called multiple times with different keys and signatures, and if any call succeeds, then its Proof is returned.\n\nSimilarly, verify_dnskey_rrset() returns Ok(false) if any DNSKEY record is covered by a DS record. A comment says \"If all the keys are valid, then we are secure\", but this is only checking that one key is authenticated by a DS in the parent zone's delegation point. This time, after control flow returns to verify_rrset(), it will call verify_default_rrset(). The special handling for DNSKEYs in verify_default_rrset() will then call verify_rrset_with_dnskey() using each KSK DNSKEY record, and if one call succeeds, return its Proof.

If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, update them accordingly.\n4. Check the updated wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and ensure you see 1.5.8, 2.0.6, 2.1.5 or 2.2.2.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nThe patch is consensus breaking and requires a coordinated upgrade.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis issue was found by meadow101 who reported

derivation method instantiated with certain curves may allow attacker to find derivation path which results into very long derivation (possible DoS)","details":"### Impact\n<!-- _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_ -->\n\n**Impacted are the only ones who use [`hd_wallet::Slip10Like`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/0.5.1/hd_wallet/struct.Slip10Like.html) or [`slip_10`](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/) derivation method instantiated with curves other than secp256k1 and secp256r1.**\n\n`hd_wallet` crate used to provide `Slip10Like` derivation method, which is also provided in `slip-10` crate as a default derivation method. It's based on [slip10](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md) method that searches for a valid child key in an infinite loop until it's found.\n\nTheoretically, this could be exploited by an attacker by finding a derivation path that would force someone to execute a lot of iterations of this loop to find a valid child key. This attack, however, requires the probability of getting an invalid scalar from random 32 bytes to be high. Slip10 is protected from this attack as it's only defined on secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves, for which such probability is very low:\n\n- For secp256k1, probability is $< 2^{-127}$. This means that a loop with 2 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n- For secp256r1, probability is $< 2^{-32}$. This means that a loop with 5 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n\nWhile standard curves are safe to use with slip10, we used to allow slip10-like derivation which can be instantiated with any curve. For instance, one could instantiate it with ed25519 or stark curves, for which probability of getting invalid scalar from random 32 bytes is >90%, so theoretically, attacker could try to DoS such construction.\n\n### Patches\n<!-- _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_ -->\n\n`hd_wallet v0.6.0` has been patched by removing slip10-like derivation from public API.\n\nIf you need HD derivation on other curves than secp256k1 and secp256r1, we suggest you to use:\n* [`hd_wallet::Edwards`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/latest/hd_wallet/edwards/struct.Edwards.html) derivation method available for ed25519 curve\n* [`hd_wallet::Stark`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/latest/hd_wallet/stark/struct.Stark.html) derivation method available for stark curve\n\nBoth derivation methods are non-standard, but secure and efficient.\n\n**If you're still using `slip_10`** and would like to migrate to patched version, please migrate to `hd_wallet v0.6`. You may first migrate from `slip_10 v0.4` to `hd_wallet v0.5` by following migration instructions available [in the docs](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/), and then upgrade from `hd_wallet v0.5` to `hd_wallet v0.6`.\n\n### Workarounds\nTechnically, you don't need to upgrade if you don't use slip10-like derivation instantiated with other curves than secp256k1 or secp256r1.\n\nHowever, if you do, migrating to other derivation method might be required.\n\n### Reach out to us in Discord\n\nIf you want to reach out to us, feel free to write to [`#lockness` room in Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/905194001349627914/1294284489635139585)\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Alessio Marziali <alessio.marziali@metaco.com> for discovering and flagging this issue","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hd-wallet","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hd-wallet"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r.json"}},{"package":{"name":"slip-10","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/slip-10"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet/security/advisories/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet/commit/a7e37704600ee7c737dbb02db08814dd2d15389d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-12-18T15:51:24Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.633323Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp","published":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","modified":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","summary":"CosmWasm VM Incorrect metering","details":"# CWA-2024-007\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.3\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.4\n- wasmvm < 1.5.5\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.4\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.7\n- cosmwasm-vm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3\n- cosmwasm-vm 1.5.8, 2.0.7, 2.1.4\n\n## Description of the bug\n\n(Blank for now.

If affected versions of the Router receive highly compressed payloads, this could result in significant memory consumption while the compressed payload is expanded. \n\n### Patches\nRouter version 1.40.2 has a fix for the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are unable to upgrade, you may be able to implement mitigations at proxies or load balancers positioned in front of your Router fleet (e.g. Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-native WAF services) by creating limits on HTTP body upload size. \n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apollo-router","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/apollo-router"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.9.5"},{"fixed":"1.40.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/9e9527c73c8f34fc8438b09066163cd42520f413"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-409"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-06T18:24:17Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.656916Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf","published":"2024-03-06T17:04:29Z","modified":"2024-03-06T17:42:13.690789Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-27934"],"related":["CVE-2024-27934"],"summary":"*const c_void / ExternalPointer unsoundness leading to use-after-free","details":"### Summary\n\nUse of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Details\n\n`*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` (defined via `external!()` macros) types are used to represent `v8::External` wrapping arbitrary `void*` with an external lifetime. This is inherently unsafe as we are effectively eliding all Rust lifetime safety guarantees.\n\n`*const c_void` is trivially unsafe. `ExternalPointer` attempts to resolve this issue by wrapping the underlying pointer with a `usize`d marker ([`ExternalWithMarker<T>`](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/blob/a2838062a8f51926140a48a8aa926330c6f9070c/core/external.rs#L49)).\n\nHowever, the marker [relies on the randomness of PIE address (binary base address)](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/blob/a2838062a8f51926140a48a8aa926330c6f9070c/core/external.rs#L10) which is still trivially exploitable for a non-PIE binary. It is also equally exploitable on a PIE binary when an attacker is able to derandomize the PIE address. This is problematic as it escalates an information leak of the PIE address into an exploitable vulnerability.\n\nNote that an attacker able to control code executed inside the Deno runtime is very likely to be able to bypass ASLR with any means necessary (e.g. by chaining another vulnerability, or by using other granted permissions such as `--allow-read` to read `/proc/self/maps`).\n\n\n### PoC\n\nFor simplicity, we use Deno version 1.38.0 where streaming operations uses `*const c_void`. Testing environment is Docker image `denoland/deno:alpine-1.38.0@sha256:fe51a00f4fbbaf1e72b29667c3eeeda429160cef2342f22a92c3820020d41f38` although the exact versions shouldn't matter much if it's in 1.36.2 up to 1.38.0 (before `ExternalPointer` patch, refer Impact section for details)\n\n```js\nconst ops = Deno[Deno.internal].core.ops;\nconst rid = ops.op_readable_stream_resource_allocate();\nconst sink = ops.op_readable_stream_resource_get_sink(rid);\n\n// close\nops.op_readable_stream_resource_close(sink);\nops.op_readable_stream_resource_close(sink);\n\n// reclaim BoundedBufferChannelInner\nconst ab = new ArrayBuffer(0x8058);\nconst dv = new DataView(ab);\n\n// forge chunk contents\ndv.setBigUint64(0, 2n, true);\ndv.setBigUint64(0x8030, 0x1337c0d30000n, true);\n\n// trigger segfault\nDeno.close(rid);\n```\n\nBelow is the dmesg log after the crash. We see that Deno has segfaulted on `1337c0d30008`, which is +8 of what we have written at offset 0x8030. Note also that the dereferenced value will immediately be used as a function pointer, with the first argument dereferenced from offset 0x8038 - it is trivial to use this to build an end-to-end exploit.\n\n```text\n[ 6439.821046] deno[15088]: segfault at 1337c0d30008 ip 0000557b53e2fb3e sp 00007fffd485ac70 error 4 in deno[557b51714000+2d7f000] likely on CPU 12 (core 12, socket 0)\n[ 6439.821054] Code: 00 00 00 00 48 85 c0 74 03 ff 50 08 49 8b 86 30 80 00 00 49 8b be 38 80 00 00 49 c7 86 30 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 48 85 c0 74 03 <ff> 50 08 48 ff 03 48 83 c4 08 5b 41 5e c3 48 8d 3d 0d 1a 59 fb 48\n```\n\nThe same vulnerability exists for `ExternalPointer` implementation, but now it is required for the attacker to either leak the PIE address somehow, or else exploit unexpected aliasing behavior of `v8::External` values. The latter has not been investigated in depth, but it is theoretically possible to alias the same underlying pointer to different `v8::External` on different threads (Workers) and exploit the concurrency (`RefCell` may break this though).\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUse of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.\n\nThis bug is **known to be exploitable** for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations.\n\nAffected versions of Deno is from 1.36.2 up to latest.\n\n- [ext/web/stream_resource.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/ext/web/stream_resource.rs):\n  - `*const c_void` introduced in 1.36.2\n  - Patched into `ExternalPointer` in 1.38.1\n- [ext/http/http_next.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/ext/http/http_next.rs):\n  - `ExternalPointer` introduced in 1.38.2\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.36.2"},{"fixed":"1.40.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-06T17:04:29Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.637288Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3xc6-7h59-j2x4","published":"2024-03-06T00:31:27Z","modified":"2024-03-06T15:34:11Z","withdrawn":"2024-03-06T15:34:11Z","summary":"Duplicate Advisory: eza Potential Heap Overflow Vulnerability for AArch64","details":"## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-3qx3-6hxr-j2ch.

They do though perform an unsafe operation that may not uphold the invariants of the safe function they are in, and could lead to undefined behavior and buffer overreads on malformed input.\n\nThese are of the same nature as those in my previous report about the molecule crate.\n\nPatch attached for commit 1b09e37c8e1b7945495cd18d9782417fbe51e986 that fixes all cases I know of at this time.\n\nPlease consider this report for reward under the terms of the bug bounty program.\n\nRelated advisory: https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/security/advisories/GHSA-rffv-8x7x-p7pw","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ckb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ckb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.31.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.31.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/02/GHSA-q669-2vfg-cxcg/GHSA-q669-2vfg-cxcg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/security/advisories/GHSA-q669-2vfg-cxcg"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/commit/adf8f0d08bc058383a0df658ea2c2ef6e7950335"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-02-02T20:59:17Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.673819Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-x96g-95fq-4xv4","published":"2023-07-18T15:30:36Z","modified":"2023-12-20T23:41:34.819507Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-47085"],"summary":"libostree vulnerable to denial of service attack","details":"An issue was discovered in ostree before version 0.17.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via the print_panic function in repo_checkout_filter.rs.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ostree","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ostree"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.17.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/07/GHSA-x96g-95fq-4xv4/GHSA-x96g-95fq-4xv4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-47085"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/issues/2775"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree/commit/d9bb160a7c1e7f0a2308a7282622b91bc27d448c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.eprintln.html"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ostreedev/ostree"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-12-20T23:16:17Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-07-18T14:15:12Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.685922Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-xw5j-gv2g-mjm2","published":"2023-02-14T21:53:37Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:24:34.246767Z","aliases":["RUSTSEC-2023-0014"],"summary":"Miscompilation in cortex-m-rt 0.7.1 and 0.7.2","details":"Version 0.7.1 of the `cortex-m-rt` crate introduced a regression causing the stack to NOT be eight-byte aligned prior to calling `main` (or any other specified entrypoint), violating the [stack ABI of AAPCS32], the default ABI used by all Cortex-M targets.

self.elf_header().section_header_entry_num() as usize;\n    unsafe {\n        let sh_ptr = self.content().as_ptr().add(sh_off);\n        from_raw_parts(sh_ptr as *const ET::SectionHeader, sh_num)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhile this will work perfectly fine *if* the ELF header is valid, malicious or malformed input can contain a section header offset of an arbitrary size, meaning that the resultant pointer in the unsafe block can point to an artibrary address in the address space of the process.\n\nThis can result in unpredictable behaviour, and in our fuzz testing, we discovered that it's trivial to cause SIGABRT (signal 6), or SEGV (signal 11).\n\nThe function should either be marked as unsafe, with a note that the caller is responsible for providing only valid inputs, or it should ideally do the due diligence to ensure that the offset doesn't exceed the bounds of the header (and add additional checks as necessary).\n\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"elf_rs","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/elf_rs"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.3.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/01/GHSA-g6pw-999w-j75m/GHSA-g6pw-999w-j75m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vincenthouyi/elf_rs/issues/11"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vincenthouyi/elf_rs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0079.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-01-20T22:41:01Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.661059Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-fq33-vmhv-48xh","published":"2023-04-07T19:23:49Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:19:06.327800Z","aliases":["RUSTSEC-2023-0032"],"summary":"ntru-rs

However, a recent addition to Miri checks that references passed to functions are valid during the entire execution of the function, even when those references are passed inside a struct. This poses an issue for dropping self-referencing values, as the reference becomes invalid during the dropping process. Effectively, since self-referencing structs are not allowed in vanilla Rust, there is no allowance for dropping data during a function that has also been given a reference to that data. There's usually no way to pass a and &a to the same function.\n\nA fix was attempted, where the struct would be turned in to a raw byte array and only transformed back into the underlying data type inside each function. This is allowable as a reference can be created and die over the body of a function, as long as the reference was created inside the function. However, this is also not sound if the original struct contains padding. There is no way to initialize padding bytes to a known value that Miri will accept, so when it is cast to an array some of the bytes contain uninitialized values. This is not acceptable (despite the fact that these bytes are never read) due to the potential for optimizations that may read from the uninitialized bytes.

A malicious package included as a dependency may inject nearly arbitrary HTML here, potentially leading to XSS if the report is subsequently uploaded somewhere.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is \"low\" for users relying on dependencies from git, local paths, or alternative registries. Users who solely depend on crates.io are unaffected.\n\n\nNote that **by design** Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability in this advisory allows performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros.\n\n# Overview\n\nRust 1.60.0 [introduced](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/04/07/Rust-1.60.0.html#cargo---timings) `cargo build --timings`, which produces a report of how long the different steps of the build process took. It includes lists of Cargo features for each crate.\n\nPrior to Rust 1.72, Cargo feature names were allowed to contain almost any characters (with some exceptions as used by the feature syntax), but it would produce a future incompatibility warning about them [since Rust 1.49](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8814). crates.io is far more stringent about what it considers a valid feature name and has not allowed such feature names.\n\nAs the feature names defined in the `Cargo.toml` file were included unescaped in the timings report, they could be used to inject Javascript into the page. For example with a feature name like `features = [\"<img src='' onerror=alert(0)\"]`. If this report were subsequently uploaded to a domain that uses credentials, the injected Javascript could access resources from the website visitor.\n\nThis issue was fixed by [turning the future incompatibility warning into an error](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12291).\n\n# Affected versions\n\nThe vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo after and including 1.60.0. Rust 1.72, to be released on August 24, will include a fix for it.\n\nUsers whose dependencies are entirely on crates.io are unaffected.\n\n# Mitigations\n\nWe recommend users always excercise care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities.\n\ncrates.io has server-side checks preventing this attack, and there are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to excercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code execution is allowed by design there as well.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cargo","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cargo"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.60.0"},{"fixed":"1.72"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/08/GHSA-wrrj-h57r-vx9p/GHSA-wrrj-h57r-vx9p.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-wrrj-h57r-vx9p"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/commit/9835622853f08be9a4b58ebe29dcec8f43b64b33"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/commit/f975722a0eac934c0722f111f107c4ea2f5c4365"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-08-24T22:15:51Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-08-24T23:15:09Z","severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.684168Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-cx7h-h87r-jpgr","published":"2024-07-25T16:38:42Z","modified":"2025-01-21T18:18:40Z","aliases":["RUSTSEC-2024-0359"],"related":["CGA-467g-5xq8-cmgr"],"summary":"The kstring integration in gix-attributes is unsound","details":"`gix-attributes` (in [`state::ValueRef`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/gix-attributes-v0.22.2/gix-attributes/src/state.rs#L19-L27)) unsafely creates a `&str` from a `&[u8]` containing non-UTF8 data, with the justification that so long as nothing reads the `&str` and relies on it being UTF-8 in the `&str`, there is no UB:\n\n```rust\n// SAFETY: our API makes accessing that value as `str` impossible, so illformed UTF8 is never exposed as such.\n```\n\nThe problem is that the non-UTF8 `str` **is** exposed to outside code: first to the `kstring` crate itself, which requires UTF-8 in its documentation and may have UB as a consequence of this, but also to `serde`, where it propagates to e.g. `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`, etc., where the same problems occur.\n\nThis is not sound, and it could cause further UB down the line in these places that can view the `&str`.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-attributes","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-attributes"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.22.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-cx7h-h87r-jpgr/GHSA-cx7h-h87r-jpgr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/issues/1460"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/issues/1460"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/commit/884aaa1646132bc3a27ba058197d6ef039bec294"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0359.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-172"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-07-25T16:38:42Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.657634Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-rp9h-rf7g-hwgr","published":"2024-11-14T15:45:55Z","modified":"2024-11-14T15:45:55Z","related":["CGA-72h6-hxqw-wfpj"],"summary":"s2n-tls has undefined behavior at process exit","details":"### Impact\ns2n-tls uses the Linux atexit function to register functions that clean up the global state when the process exits.

This issue arises from a \"Double Public Key Signing Function Oracle Attack\" affecting versions of `ed25519-dalek` prior to v2.0. These versions expose an unsafe API for serializing and deserializing 64-byte keypairs that include both private and public keys, creating potential for certain attacks. `d25519-dalek` users utilizing these serialization and deserialization functions directly could potentially be impacted. \n\n## Patches\n\nThe vulnerability within the `ed25519-dalek` crate has been addressed in version 2.0. `rusty-paseto` has addressed it in release v0.6.0. \n\n## Workarounds\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to v0.6.0 of `rusty-paseto`. However, users should still ensure that their key serialization and deserialization practices are secure and avoid any practices that could lead to key exposure.\n\n## References\n\nMore information about RUSTSEC-2022-0093 can be found in the [RustSec Advisory Database](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0093.html).

This issue was first reported by Dependabot on 2023-08-15. The source was reviewed by @rrrodzilla at that time and a determination was made that the vulnerability low harm to existing users due to the strongly typed nature of keys provided by the rusty-paseto API. @techport-om reported the vulnerability to the repository by discovering during a `cargo-audit` run on 2023-11-05 and opened [issue 28](https://github.com/rrrodzilla/rusty_paseto/issues/28).

This is not sound for shared linear memories, which could be modified in parallel, and this could lead to a data race in the host.\n\nWasmtime has a `wasmtime::Memory` type which represents linear memories in a WebAssembly module. Wasmtime also has `wasmtime::SharedMemory`, however, which represents shared linear memories introduced in the WebAssembly `threads` proposal. The API of `SharedMemory` does not provide accessors which return `&[u8]` in Rust, for example, as that's not a sound type signature when other threads could be modifying memory. The `wasmtime::Memory` type, however, does provide this API as it's intended to be used with non-shared memories where static knowledge is available that no concurrent or parallel reads or writes are happening. This means that it's not sound to represent a shared linear memory with `wasmtime::Memory` and it must instead be represented with `wasmtime::SharedMemory`.\n\nThere were two different, erroneous, methods of creating a `wasmtime::Memory` which represents a shared memory however:\n\n1. The [`wasmtime::Memory::new` constructor](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html#method.new) takes a `MemoryType` which could be `shared`. This function did not properly reject shared memory types and require usage of [`SharedMemory::new`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.SharedMemory.html#method.new) instead.\n2. Capturing a core dump with WebAssembly would expose all linear memories a `wasmtime::Memory`. This means that a core dump would perform an unsynchronized read of shared linear memory, possibly leading to data races.\n\nThis is a bug in Wasmtime's safe Rust API. It should not be possible to cause unsoundness with Wasmtime's embedding API if `unsafe` is not used. Embeddings which do not use the wasm threads proposal nor created shared memories nor actually share shared memories across threads are unaffected. Only if shared memories are created across threads might an embedding be affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch releases have been issued for [all supported versions of Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html), notably: 24.0.5, 36.0.3, 37.0.3, and 38.0.4. These releases reject creation of shared memories via `Memory::new` and shared memories are now excluded from core dumps. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nEmbeddings affected by this issue should use `SharedMemory::new` instead of `Memory::new` to create shared memories. Affected embeddings should also disable core dumps if they are unable to upgrade. Note that core dumps are disabled by default but the wasm threads proposal (and shared memory) is enabled by default. It's recommended to upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime, however.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"38.0.0"},{"fixed":"38.0.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"37.0.0"},{"fixed":"37.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"26.0.0"},{"fixed":"36.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.0.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/11/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64345"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/9ebb6934f00d58b92fb68ed0e0b16c0ae828ca10"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Memory.html#method.new"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.SharedMemory.html#method.new"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v38.0.4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0118.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-362"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-11-12T21:36:29Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-11-12T22:15:49Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.663951Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0118","published":"2025-11-11T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-11-13T17:12:30.354190Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-64345","GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q"],"summary":"Unsound API access to a WebAssembly shared linear memory","details":"This is an entry in the RustSec database for the Wasmtime security advisory\nlocated at\nhttps://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q\nFor more information see the GitHub-hosted security advisory.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"24.0.5"},{"introduced":"25.0.0"},{"fixed":"36.0.3"},{"introduced":"37.0.0"},{"fixed":"37.0.3"},{"introduced":"38.0.0"},{"fixed":"38.0.4"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2025-0118.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0118.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-hc7m-r6v8-hg9q"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.726691Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q428-6v73-fc4q","published":"2025-11-13T15:36:03Z","modified":"2025-11-13T15:36:03Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-64517"],"summary":"sudo-rs doesn't record authenticating user properly in timestamp","details":"### Summary\nWhen `Defaults targetpw` (or `Defaults rootpw`) is enabled, the password of the target account (or root account) instead of the invoking user is used for authentication. `sudo-rs` prior to 0.2.10 incorrectly recorded the invoking user’s UID instead of the authenticated-as user's UID in the authentication timestamp.

These directives can optionally be renamed via the [`imports` argument to the `@link` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/federated-schemas/reference/directives#renaming-directives), which can be useful if their default names match an existing user-defined directive in their subgraph schema.

Router incorrectly handled access control directives on interface types/fields and their implementing object types/fields, applying them to interface types/fields while ignoring directives on their implementing object types/fields when all implementations had the same requirements.\n\n## Details\n\nApollo Federation allows users to specify access control directives ([`@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, and `@policy`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/authorization#authorization-directives)) to protect object and interface types and fields. However, the GraphQL specification does not define inheritance rules for directives from interfaces to their implementations. Apollo Router will enforce any directives on the interface types/fields but ignore any directives on the implementation object types/fields (as long as all implementations have the same requirements). This inconsistent enforcement behavior leads to unexpected runtime security gaps.\n\n## Who is impacted\n\nThis vulnerability impacts Apollo Router customers defining `@authenticated`, `@requiresScopes`, or `@policy` directives inconsistently on polymorphic types (i.e., object types that implement interface types).  Specifically, if the same access control directives are applied to all implementing types/fields but not on their implemented interface types/fields, they could be impacted.\n\n### Scope of Impact\n\nThis vulnerability could allow a malicious actor to craft a query that can bypass access control requirements on the object types/fields by instead querying them via implemented interface types/fields that don't have the same access control requirements.\n\n## Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been fixed at runtime in Apollo Router.

Truncation Attack against ChaCha20-Poly1305 and Encrypt-then-MAC aka Terrapin","details":"### Summary\n\nTerrapin is a prefix truncation attack targeting the SSH protocol. More precisely, Terrapin breaks the integrity of SSH's secure channel. By carefully adjusting the sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove an arbitrary amount of messages sent by the client or server at the beginning of the secure channel without the client or server noticing it.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nTo mitigate this protocol vulnerability, OpenSSH suggested a so-called \"strict kex\" which alters the SSH handshake to ensure a Man-in-the-Middle attacker cannot introduce unauthenticated messages as well as convey sequence number manipulation across handshakes.\n\n**Warning: To take effect, both the client and server must support this countermeasure.** \n\nAs a stop-gap measure, peers may also (temporarily) disable the affected algorithms and use unaffected alternatives like AES-GCM instead until patches are available.\n\n### Details\n\nThe SSH specifications of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*-etm@openssh.com MACs) are vulnerable against an arbitrary prefix truncation attack (a.k.a. Terrapin attack). This allows for an extension negotiation downgrade by stripping the SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO sent after the first message after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS, downgrading security, and disabling attack countermeasures in some versions of OpenSSH. When targeting Encrypt-then-MAC, this attack requires the use of a CBC cipher to be practically exploitable due to the internal workings of the cipher mode. Additionally, this novel attack technique can be used to exploit previously unexploitable implementation flaws in a Man-in-the-Middle scenario.\n\nThe attack works by an attacker injecting an arbitrary number of SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages during the initial key exchange and consequently removing the same number of messages just after the initial key exchange has concluded. This is possible due to missing authentication of the excess SSH_MSG_IGNORE messages and the fact that the implicit sequence numbers used within the SSH protocol are only checked after the initial key exchange.\n\nIn the case of ChaCha20-Poly1305, the attack is guaranteed to work on every connection as this cipher does not maintain an internal state other than the message's sequence number. In the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, practical exploitation requires the use of a CBC cipher; while theoretical integrity is broken for all ciphers when using this mode, message processing will fail at the application layer for CTR and stream ciphers.\n\nFor more details see [https://terrapin-attack.com](https://terrapin-attack.com). \n\n### Impact\n\nThis attack targets the specification of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com) and Encrypt-then-MAC (*-etm@openssh.com), which are widely adopted by well-known SSH implementations and can be considered de-facto standard. These algorithms can be practically exploited; however, in the case of Encrypt-Then-MAC, we additionally require the use of a CBC cipher. As a consequence, this attack works against all well-behaving SSH implementations supporting either of those algorithms and can be used to downgrade (but not fully strip) connection security in case SSH extension negotiation (RFC8308) is supported. The attack may also enable attackers to exploit certain implementation flaws in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) scenario.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"russh","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/russh"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.40.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/12/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.1.0"},{"fixed":"0.17.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/12/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"paramiko","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/paramiko"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.5.0"},{"fixed":"3.4.0"}]}],"versions":["2.10.0","2.10.1","2.10.2","2.10.3","2.10.4","2.10.5","2.10.6","2.11.0","2.11.1","2.12.0","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.6.0","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.8.0","2.8.1","2.9.0","2.9.1","2.9.2","2.9.3","2.9.4","2.9.5","3.0.0","3.1.0","3.2.0","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/12/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.0.0-20231218163308-9d2ee975ef9f"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/12/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/warp-tech/russh/security/advisories/GHSA-45x7-px36-x8w8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48795"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mwiede/jsch/issues/457"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/janmojzis/tinyssh/issues/81"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj/issues/916"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/2337"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/2337#issuecomment-1887642773"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cyd01/KiTTY/issues/520"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apache/mina-sshd/issues/445"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/456"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/2189"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ssh-mitm/ssh-mitm/issues/165"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/275249"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mwiede/jsch/pull/461"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2/pull/1291"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/commit/7279fbd6ef4d0c8bdd6a90af4ada2899d786eec0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2/commit/97b223f8891b96d6fc054df5ab1d5a1a545da2a3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/connectbot/sshlib/commit/5c8b534f6e97db7ac0e0e579331213aa25c173ab"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit/commit/8e972c5e94b460379fe0c7d20209c16df81538a5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/golang/crypto/commit/9d2ee975ef9fe627bf0a6f01c1f69e8ef1d4f05d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/warp-tech/russh/commit/1aa340a7df1d5be1c0f4a9e247aade76dfdd2951"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2023-48795-mitigate-openssh-vulnerability"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38732005"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/trilead-ssh2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nova.app/releases/#v11.8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/proftpd-dfsg"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/libssh2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-48795"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://roumenpetrov.info/secsh/#news20231220"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://oryx-embedded.com/download/#changelog"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2024-0002"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LZQVUHWVWRH73YBXUQJOD6CKHDQBU3DM"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MKQRBF3DWMWPH36LBCOBUTSIZRTPEZXB"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QI3EHAHABFQK7OABNCSF5GMYP6TONTI7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/33XHJUB6ROFUOH2OQNENFROTVH6MHSHA"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3JIMLVBDWOP4FUPXPTB4PGHHIOMGFLQE"},{"ty

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications.\n\nThe function receives a `BIO` from the caller, prepends a new `BIO_f_asn1` filter `BIO` onto the front of it to form a `BIO` chain, and then returns the new head of the `BIO` chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter `BIO` is freed and the function returns a `NULL` result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the `BIO` chain is not properly cleaned up and the `BIO` passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter `BIO`. If the caller then goes on to call `BIO_pop()` on the `BIO` then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.\n\nThis scenario occurs directly in the internal function `B64_write_ASN1()` which may cause `BIO_new_NDEF()` to be called and will subsequently call `BIO_pop()` on the `BIO`.

The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case `PEM_read_bio_ex()` will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed.

These locations include the `PEM_read_bio_TYPE()` functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssl-src","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/openssl-src"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"111.25.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/02/GHSA-v5w6-wcm8-jm4q/GHSA-v5w6-wcm8-jm4q.json"}},{"package":{"name":"openssl-src","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/openssl-src"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"300.0.0"},{"fixed":"300.0.12"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/02/GHSA-v5w6-wcm8-jm4q/GHSA-v5w6-wcm8-jm4q.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=63bcf189be73a9cc1264059bed6f57974be74a83"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=bbcf509bd046b34cca19c766bbddc31683d0858b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0003"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0010.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-415"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-02-08T22:22:58Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-02-08T20:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.679895Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-8rwr-x37p-mx23","published":"2022-11-01T17:45:59Z","modified":"2025-11-04T22:07:42Z","aliases":["BIT-node-2022-3602","BIT-node-min-2022-3602","CVE-2022-3602","RUSTSEC-2022-0064"],"related":["CGA-2492-c4jv-55c4","CGA-9g54-69rw-c9j6","CGA-hgg8-h6vf-32c8"],"summary":"X.509 Email Address 4-byte Buffer Overflow","details":"A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking.

As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.\n\nDetails\n\nverify_dnskey_rrset() will return Ok(true) if any record's public key matches a trust anchor. This results in verify_rrset() returning a Secure proof. This ultimately results in successfully verifying a response containing DNSKEY records. verify_default_rrset() looks up DNSKEY records by calling handle.lookup(), which takes the above code path. There's a comment following this that says \"DNSKEYs were already validated by the inner query in the above lookup\", but this is not the case. To fully verify the whole RRset of DNSKEYs, it would be necessary to check self-signatures by the trusted key over the other keys. Later in verify_default_rrset(), verify_rrset_with_dnskey() is called multiple times with different keys and signatures, and if any call succeeds, then its Proof is returned.\n\nSimilarly, verify_dnskey_rrset() returns Ok(false) if any DNSKEY record is covered by a DS record. A comment says \"If all the keys are valid, then we are secure\", but this is only checking that one key is authenticated by a DS in the parent zone's delegation point. This time, after control flow returns to verify_rrset(), it will call verify_default_rrset(). The special handling for DNSKEYs in verify_default_rrset() will then call verify_rrset_with_dnskey() using each KSK DNSKEY record, and if one call succeeds, return its Proof. If there are multiple KSK DNSKEYs in the RRset, then this leads to another authentication break. We need to either pass the authenticated DNSKEYs from the DS covering check to the RRSIG validation, or we need to perform this RRSIG validation of the DNSKEY RRset inside verify_dnskey_rrset() and cut verify_default_rrset() out of DNSKEY RRset validation entirely.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hickory-proto","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hickory-proto"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.8.0"},{"fixed":"0.24.3"},{"introduced":"0.25.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.25.0-alpha.5"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":["hickory_proto::dnssec::DnssecDnsHandle::send","hickory_proto::xfer::DnssecDnsHandle::send"],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["crypto-failure"],"cvss":null,"informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2025-0006.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/hickory-proto"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0006.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.721540Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-rr8g-9fpq-6wmg","published":"2025-04-07T21:12:50Z","modified":"2025-10-28T06:29:26.130595Z","aliases":["RUSTSEC-2025-0023"],"related":["CGA-39q5-mwwc-8jj8","CGA-74v5-7j58-7qvr","CGA-7c85-4m6q-cpmq","CGA-7q6r-g5rx-375r","CGA-7qq2-mjhr-3qgr","CGA-827g-q963-xhxf","CGA-8g88-6gm5-vwmr","CGA-8mjv-gx87-jv3q","CGA-9h3j-8r4f-m9g4","CGA-c8x2-j4qf-cpxp","CGA-fwpg-h594-whgc","CGA-g978-8r2f-pc73","CGA-h38x-89gc-ppj2","CGA-q8xh-fg87-xg8p","CGA-v7r3-37jc-phw4","CGA-w249-vw33-357q","CGA-wjj8-6rhm-w2mq","CGA-x8mx-8v67-25w5"],"summary":"Tokio broadcast channel calls clone in parallel, but does not require `Sync`","details":"The broadcast channel internally calls `clone` on the stored value when receiving it, and only requires `T:Send`.

However, the trait is not marked as unsafe, meaning users of the crate may implement it under the assumption that the library safely handles the returned raw pointers. These raw pointers can later be dereferenced within safe APIs of the crate-such as `arenavec::common::SliceVec::push`-potentially leading to arbitrary memory access.\n\n- The safe API `arenavec::common::SliceVec::reserve` can reach the private function `arenavec::common::allocate_inner`. Incorrect behavior in `allocate_inner` may result in a `SliceVec` with an increased capacity, even though the underlying memory has not actually been expanded. This mismatch between `SliceVec.capacity` and the actual reserved memory can lead to a heap buffer overflow.\n\n- The safe API `arenavec::common::SliceVec::split_off` can duplicate the ownership of the elements in `self` (of type `SliceVec`) if they implement the `Drop` trait.

However, the trait is not marked as unsafe, meaning users of the crate may implement it under the assumption that the library safely handles the returned raw pointers. These raw pointers can later be dereferenced within safe APIs of the crate-such as `arenavec::common::SliceVec::push`-potentially leading to arbitrary memory access.\n\n- The safe API `arenavec::common::SliceVec::reserve` can reach the private function `arenavec::common::allocate_inner`. Incorrect behavior in `allocate_inner` may result in a `SliceVec` with an increased capacity, even though the underlying memory has not actually been expanded. This mismatch between `SliceVec.capacity` and the actual reserved memory can lead to a heap buffer overflow.\n\n- The safe API `arenavec::common::SliceVec::split_off` can duplicate the ownership of the elements in `self` (of type `SliceVec`) if they implement the `Drop` trait. Specifically, when `at == 0`, the method returns a new `SliceVec` with the same length as `self`. Since both `self` and the returned object point to the same heap memory, dropping one will deallocate the shared memory.

This bug was introduced in the release of Wasmtime 38.0.0 and affects it subsequent patch releases of 38.0.1 and 38.0.2. No other versions of Wasmtime are affected.\n\nIn Wasmtime 38 the implementation of host-to-wasm trampolines was refactored to remove the old usage of `setjmp` and `longjmp` to unwind the stack. In this transition, however, trampolines for component-model intrinsics were accidentally not updated meaning that they didn't update runtime data structures as the other host-to-wasm trampolines did. If an error ocurred during execution of wasm it would then try to read this runtime data which isn't present, and processing it could then result in a crash. For example one piece of runtime data is where to jump to in the case of a trap, and this is intended to be updated by trampolines during their execution. In this situation the trampoline didn't do anything meaning that the value was left set to 0 meaning that execution would jump to the 0 address and deterministically crash the program with a segfault.\n\nComponent intrinsic host-to-wasm trampolines are not typically used in most situations. These only exist for carefully crafted components no toolchain would conventionally produce. For example if the `resource.rep` intrinsic were directly lifted without having any other wasm in play then it would use the component intrinsic host-to-wasm trampoline. This effectively means that any component required to trigger this bug would have to be carefully crafted for this specific issue. Furthermore triggering this bug would require that these intrinsics are called from the host which requires specific type signatures to be used. Not all embeddings may be invoking functions with exactly the right type signatures, meaning that even if a component could be crafted a pre-built embedding may still not be able to run the component.\n\nOverall the goal of Wasmtime's API is that, without `unsafe` in Rust, it should not be possible to crash the runtime. With Wasmtime 38.0.{0,1,2} it is possible to crash the runtime, however, hence this security issue. Actually exploiting this in practice would require (a) carefully crafted components, (b) a very specific host embedder using the right type signatures, and (c) a host that updated to 38.0.{0,1,2} within the last few days (38.0.0 was released on 2025-10-20, and this is being published on 2025-10-24). This likely means that almost no embedding is affected, but this security issue is nonetheless being posted for awareness.\n\n### Patches\n\nWasmtime 38.0.3 has been released and is patched to fix this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAffected embeddings have no workaround other than updating to 38.0.3. Users of 37.0.x and prior are not affected. Embeddings that only work with core wasm are not affected. Embeddings may only be affected if functions of specific component type signatures are used/invoked, meaning that if all the prior conditions hold the embedding would need to be audited to see if it's affected.\n\n### References\n\nThe PR which refactored setjmp/longjmp usage and introduced this issue is https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11592.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"38.0.0"},{"fixed":"38.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-4h67-722j-5pmc/GHSA-4h67-722j-5pmc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-4h67-722j-5pmc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62711"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11592"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/192f2fcdadfec9d0cf6b58548a85a7307450cbf5"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0112.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-755"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-27T20:18:01Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-24T22:15:49Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.640227Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx","published":"2025-10-21T15:42:51Z","modified":"2025-10-27T15:13:02Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-62518","RUSTSEC-2025-0110"],"related":["CVE-2025-62518","RUSTSEC-2025-0111"],"summary":"astral-tokio-tar Vulnerable to PAX Header Desynchronization","details":"## Summary\n\nVersions of `astral-tokio-tar` prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing vulnerability that allows attackers to smuggle additional archive entries by exploiting inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling. When processing archives with PAX-extended headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly advances stream position based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified size, causing it to interpret file content as legitimate tar headers.\n\nThis vulnerability was disclosed to multiple Rust tar parsers, all derived from the original `async-tar` fork of `tar-rs`.\n\n## Details\n\n### Vulnerability Description\n\nThe vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of PAX extended headers versus ustar headers when determining file data boundaries. Specifically:\n\n1. **PAX header** correctly specifies the file size (e.g., `size=1048576`)\n2. **ustar header** incorrectly specifies zero size (`size=000000000000`)\n3. **tokio-tar** advances the stream position based on the ustar size (0 bytes)\n4. **Inner content** is then interpreted as legitimate outer archive entries\n\n### Attack Mechanism\n\nWhen a TAR file contains:\n\n- An outer entry with PAX `size=N` but ustar `size=0`\n- File data that begins with valid TAR header structures\n- The parser treats inner content as additional outer entries\n\nThis creates a **header/data desynchronization** where the parser's position becomes misaligned with actual file boundaries.\n\n### Root Cause\n\n```rust\n// Vulnerable: Uses ustar size instead of PAX override\nlet file_size = header.size(); // Returns 0 from ustar field\nlet next_pos = current_pos + 512 + pad_to_512(file_size); // Advances 0 bytes\n\n// Fixed: Apply PAX overrides before position calculation\nlet mut file_size = header.size();\nif let Some(pax_size) = pending_pax.get(\"size\") {\n    file_size = pax_size.parse().unwrap();\n}\nlet next_pos = current_pos + 512 + pad_to_512(file_size); // Correct advance\n\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability depends on where `astral-tokio-tar` is used, and whether it is used to extract untrusted tar archives. If used to extract untrusted inputs, it may result in unexpected attacker-controlled access to the filesystem, in turn potential resulting in arbitrary code execution or credential exfiltration.\n\nSee [**GHSA-w476-p2h3-79g9**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/security/advisories/GHSA-w476-p2h3-79g9) for how this vulnerability affects `uv`, `astral-tokio-tar`'s primary downstream user.

however, when a file is opened, even with read only flags and deny-write permission, it's still possible to change the access (`atime`) and modification (`mtime`) times, and thus bypass the permission model.\n\n### PoC\n\nSetup:\n```\ndeno --version\ndeno 2.4.2 (stable, release, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)\nv8 13.7.152.14-rusty\ntypescript 5.8.3\n\ntouch test.txt\n```\n\n```js\n// touch test.txt\n//

is Vulnerable to Command Injection on Windows During Batch File Execution","details":"### Summary\nDeno versions up to 2.5.1 are vulnerable to Command Line Injection attacks on Windows when batch files are executed.\n\n### Details\nIn Windows, ``CreateProcess()`` always implicitly spawns ``cmd.exe`` if a batch file (.bat, .cmd, etc.) is being executed even if the application does not specify it via the command line. This makes Deno vulnerable to a command injection attack on Windows as demonstrated by the two proves-of-concept below.\n\n### PoC\nUsing `node:child_process` (with the `env` and `run` permissions):\n```JS\nconst { spawn } = require('node:child_process');\nconst child = spawn('./test.bat', ['&calc.exe']);\n```\nUsing `Deno.Command.spawn()` (with the `run` permission):\n```JS\nconst

is vulnerable to heap memory allocation re-use bug","details":"### Impact\n\nA memory safety vulnerability was present in the Fuel Virtual Machine (FuelVM), where memory reads could bypass expected access controls. Specifically, when a smart contract performed a `mload` (or other opcodes which access memory) on memory that had been deallocated using `ret`, it was still able to access the old memory contents. This occurred because the memory region was not zeroed out or otherwise marked as invalid. As a result, smart contracts could potentially read sensitive data left over from other contracts if the same memory was reallocated, violating isolation guarantees between contracts and enabling unintended data leakage.\n\nAll users running affected versions of FuelVM that relied on strict memory isolation between smart contracts were impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability was patched by modifying the FuelVM to ensure that memory deallocated with `ret` was zeroed out or made inaccessible. The fix was included in FuelVM version `v0.60.1` and back-ported to `v0.59.3`. This patch was released to the Fuel network on Friday, April 18th, 2025.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere were no reliable workarounds that fully mitigated the vulnerability. While developers could manually zero out sensitive memory regions before returning from a function, this approach was error-prone and could not be enforced at the VM level. Upgrading to a patched version remained the recommended course of action.\n\n### References\n\n- Fix implemented in the FuelVM GitHub repository (https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/941)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"fuel-vm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/fuel-vm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.59.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-2pgj-5cv2-6xxw/GHSA-2pgj-5cv2-6xxw.json"}},{"package":{"name":"fuel-vm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/fuel-vm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.60.0"},{"fixed":"0.60.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-2pgj-5cv2-6xxw/GHSA-2pgj-5cv2-6xxw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/security/advisories/GHSA-2pgj-5cv2-6xxw"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/941"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/commit/9c97c2bf782626b35ba48e154f210f91c847a513"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-08T12:43:30Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.634075Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-5rxf-fqch-7vqp","published":"2023-09-13T15:31:14Z","modified":"2025-10-03T15:12:28.493464Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-39916"],"summary":"NLnet Labs’ Routinator vulnerable to path traversal","details":"NLnet Labs’ Routinator 0.9.0 up to and including 0.12.1 contains a possible path traversal vulnerability in the optional, off-by-default keep-rrdp-responses feature that allows users to store the content of responses received for RRDP requests.

This capability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within the guest. As `sys_read` is the mechanism by which input is requested by the guest, all guest programs built with the affected versions are vulnerable. This critically compromises the soundness guarantees of the guest program.\n\nA fix was applied in [\\#3351](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/pull/3351). The vulnerable pointer arithmetic was removed, and replaced with a simplified implementation in the `v1compat` kernel which uses Rust’s slice functions to guarantee memory safety.\n\nThe fix has been released as part of `risc0-zkvm` versions `2.3.2` and `3.0.3`. All prior versions are affected.\n\n## Remediation\n\nAll developers of zkVM applications should update their guests to use `risc0-zkvm` versions `^2.3.2` or `^3.0.3`.\n\nThis upgrade can be accomplished by editing all `Cargo.toml` files in the following way.\n\n* Any references to [`risc0-zkvm`](https://crates.io/crates/risc0-zkvm) should use version specifiers `”2.3.2”` or `”3.0.3”`.  \n* Any references to [`risc0-build`](https://crates.io/crates/risc0-build) should use version specifiers `”2.3.2”` or `”3.0.3”`, matching `risc0-zkvm`.  \n* Any references to [`risc0-zkvm-platform`](https://crates.io/crates/risc0-zkvm-platform) should use version specifier `”2.1.0”` or later. Most projects will not have direct references to this crate.\n\nRebuild your application including the guest. You can run the following command to check that the patch is applied:\n\n```shell\n# Provide the path to your guest Cargo.toml. Should report risc0-zkvm-platform >=v2.1.0\ncargo tree --depth 0 -p risc0-zkvm-platform --manifest-path path/to/methods/guest/Cargo.toml\n```\n\nAny applications that use the image ID of this guest need to be updated with the newly built image ID.\n\nNote that there are no changes to the RISC Zero proof system or circuits. Provers are not required to take any action. Users of the Groth16 smart contract verifier and the [RISC Zero Verifier Router](https://dev.risczero.com/api/blockchain-integration/contracts/verifier#verifier-router) are not required to take any action beyond updating their guest programs.\n\nAny applications using the `risc0-aggregation` crate or the `RiscZeroSetVerifier` smart contract should update to version `>=0.9`.

The key material in question are the keys stored in the MLS secret tree, which are used for decryption of private MLS messages. The effects of the bug are limited in scope, but can affect forward secrecy and limit how many messages can be decrypted.\n\n### Technical details\n\n#### Scope\n\nThe scope of the bug is limited to private messages (application and handshake messages) received in groups. Furthermore, the scope is limited to one epoch and the effects are reset with each epoch transition, or through consecutive group operations without reloading group state in between.\n\n#### Functional impact\n\nWithin each epoch of a group, there is a maximum number of private messages per sender that can be skipped before an error is thrown. The number of messages is set through maximum_forward_distance in the SenderRatchetConfiguration and the default value is 1000. The bug causes the library to think that private messages have been processed, even when that's not the case. This can cause an error to be returned during message processing.\n\n#### Security impact\n\nThis bug can be exploited only if an adversary gains access to the client’s state. The risk for exploitation is thus relatively low in typical use cases.\n\nThe bug can be exploited to decrypt more messages than intended by the client. The number of additional messages that can be decrypted is limited to the number of messages that can be skipped, which is maximum_forward_distance. This means that if an adversary gains access to a client’s state, they can decrypt up to maximum_forward_distance additional messages per sender in the current epoch. This affects forward secrecy, as messages that were previously considered secure can be decrypted.\n\nOpenMLS otherwise deletes message encryption keys as soon as an epoch ends if not otherwise configured via the `max_past_epochs` setting. This is still the case even in vulnerable versions.\n\n### Affected versions\n\nVulnerable: all versions up to and including version 0.7.0\n\nNot vulnerable: all versions greater than and including version 0.7.1 (see below for security after upgrading from a vulnerable version to a secure one)\n\n### Mitigation\n\nMessage encryption secrets are deleted when a commit is merged, i.e. when the group transitions to the next epoch. If the client is not configured to retain message secrets for past epochs, messages decrypted in past epochs are thus secure. If past message secrets are retained, messages decrypted in past epochs are secure as soon as the relevant epoch leaves the retention window. Increasing update/commit frequency can thus help keep the window for compromise low.\nAnother way to mitigate the effect is to create a private message (application or handshake message) for each sender of previously received messages. It is important to do that with the same MlsGroup object, withpout reloading it from storage in between. This will ensure that the message encryption keys are updated correctly.\n\n### Security post-patch\n\nSince the bug affects persisted state, patching by itself strictly speaking doesn’t solve the issue. State written prior to patching is still vulnerable. An affected client is fully healed from the effects of this bug as soon as it either enters the next epoch (by merging a commit), or, if message encryption key retention is configured, by advancing sufficiently many epochs for pre-patch epoch state to drop out of the retention window.\n\nAdditionally, the client is healed even before the next epoch, if it processes enough messages s.t. any messages decrypted pre-patch fall out of the window for out-of-order tolerance. This is 5 by default, but can be configured to an arbitrary number using the `sender_ratchet_configuration` setting during group creation.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank [Ege Erdogan](https://github.com/erdoganege) and [Fatih Ergin](https://github.com/fatihergin) for reporting this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openmls","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/openmls"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.7.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.7.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/09/GHSA-qr9h-x63w-vqfm/GHSA-qr9h-x63w-vqfm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openmls/openmls/security/advisories/GHSA-qr9h-x63w-vqfm"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openmls/openmls/commit/c73a074c804b30bec8284ac1e69a71b01db982ea"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/openmls/openmls"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-09-26T15:32:21Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:P/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.675706Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0070","published":"2025-09-17T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-09-18T07:27:06.954909Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-8671","GHSA-mrjm-qq9m-9mjq"],"summary":"Pingora MadeYouReset HTTP/2 vulnerability","details":"Pingora deployments using versions prior to 0.6.0 that include HTTP/2 server support may be affected by the vulnerability described in CVE-2025-8671.

Once the QUIC handshake completes, a local endpoint is responsible for issuing and retiring Connection IDs that are used by the remote peer to populate the Destination Connection ID field in packets sent from remote to local. Each Connection ID has a sequence number to ensure synchronization between peers\n\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by first completing a handshake and then sending a specially-crafted set of frames that trigger a connection ID retirement in the victim. When the victim attempts to send a packet containing RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames, [Section 19.16 of RFC 9000](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-19.16) requires that the sequence number of the retired connection ID must not be the same as the sequence number of the connection ID used by the packet. In other words, a packet cannot contain a frame that retires itself.

But depending on the command you're running, being able to inject multiple arguments where only one is expected could lead to undesired consequences, potentially including arbitrary command execution.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version 1.2.1 by escaping additional characters. Updating to 1.3.0 is recommended, but 1.2.1 offers a more minimal fix if desired.\n\nWorkaround: Check for the bytes `{` and `\\xa0` in `quote`/`join` input or output.\n\n(Note: `{` is problematic because it is used for glob expansion.  `\\xa0` is problematic because it's treated as a word separator in [specific environments][solved-xa0].)\n\n## Issue 2: Dangerous API w.r.t. nul bytes\n\nVersion 1.3.0 deprecates the `quote` and `join` APIs in favor of `try_quote` and `try_join`, which behave the same except that they have `Result` return type, returning `Err` if the input contains nul bytes.\n\nStrings containing nul bytes generally cannot be used in Unix command arguments or environment variables, and most shells cannot handle nul bytes even internally.  If you try to pass one anyway, then the results might be security-sensitive in uncommon scenarios.  [More details here.][nul-bytes]\n\nDue to the low severity, the behavior of the original `quote` and `join` APIs has not changed; they continue to allow nuls.\n\nWorkaround: Manually check for nul bytes in `quote`/`join` input or output.\n\n## Issue 3: Lack of documentation for interactive shell risks\n\nThe `quote` family of functions does not and cannot escape control characters. With non-interactive shells this is perfectly safe, as control characters have no special effect.  But if you writing directly to the standard input of an interactive shell (or through a pty), then control characters [can cause misbehavior including arbitrary command injection.][control-characters]\n\nThis is essentially unfixable, and has not been patched.

resource exhaustion through uncollected hook script processes","details":"### Impact\nHook scripts in pleezer can be triggered by various events like track changes and playback state changes. In affected versions, these scripts were spawned without proper process cleanup, leaving zombie processes in the system's process table.\n\nEven during normal usage, every track change and playback event would leave behind zombie processes. This leads to inevitable resource exhaustion over time as the system's process table fills up, eventually preventing new processes from being created. The issue is exacerbated if events occur rapidly, whether through normal use (e.g., skipping through a playlist) or potential manipulation of the Deezer Connect protocol traffic.\n\nThis vulnerability affects all users who have configured hook scripts using the `--hook` option.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in version 0.16.0.

There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic.\n\nThis bug is in the implementation of Wasmtime's `wasmtime-wasi` crate which provides an implementation of WASIp1. The bug requires a specially crafted call to `fd_renumber` in addition to the ability to open a subsequent file descriptor. Opening a second file descriptor is only possible when a preopened directory was provided to the guest, and this is common amongst embeddings. A panic in the host is considered a denial-of-service vector for WebAssembly embedders and is thus a security issue in Wasmtime.\n\nThis bug does not affect WASIp2 and embedders using components.\n\n### Patches\n\nIn accordance with Wasmtime's [release process](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html) patch releases are available as 24.0.4, 33.0.2, and 34.0.2. Users of other release of Wasmtime are recommended to move to a supported release of Wasmtime.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEmbedders who are using components or are not providing guest access to create more file descriptors (e.g. via a preopened filesystem directory) are not affected by this issue. Otherwise there is no workaround at this time and affected embeddings are recommended to update to a patched version which will not cause a panic in the host.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime-wasi","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime-wasi"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"24.0.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime-wasi","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime-wasi"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"25.0.0"},{"fixed":"33.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime-wasi","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime-wasi"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"34.0.0"},{"fixed":"34.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"10.0.0"},{"fixed":"24.0.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"33.0.0"},{"fixed":"33.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"34.0.0"},{"fixed":"34.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53901"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11277"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11278"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11279"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11281"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security-what-is-considered-a-security-vulnerability.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/e1aa1cae4dda4c1f70f23fe11e922aae92f240a8/legacy/preview1/witx/wasi_snapshot_preview1.witx#L245-L260"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/037a6edadbc225decbea00a551aabf04203717d9/crates/wasi/src/preview1.rs#L1824-L1836"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0046.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-672"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-18T19:50:58Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-18T18:15:24Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.659703Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0046","published":"2025-07-18T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-07-18T20:12:18.571434Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-53901","GHSA-fm79-3f68-h2fc"],"summary":"Host

does not check transaction malleability for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions","details":"### Impact\n\nPrior to `ethereum` crate v0.18.0, signature malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for \"legacy\" transactions, but not for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions.\n\nThis is a specification deviation and therefore a high severity advisory if the `ethereum` crate is used for Ethereum mainnet. Note that signature malleability itself is not a security issue, and therefore if the `ethereum` crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain, it's a low/informational severity advisory.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in `ethereum` v0.18.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can also manually check transaction malleability outside of the crate. But it's recommended to simply upgrade the version.\n\n### References\n\nSee PR: https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum/pull/67","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ethereum","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ethereum"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.18.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/07/GHSA-3w94-vq2x-v5wr/GHSA-3w94-vq2x-v5wr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-3w94-vq2x-v5wr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53359"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum/pull/67"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum/commit/2dd9d1d5d0936ec7350093ff3a5a7169a349db77"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethereum"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-754"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-07-02T15:12:18Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-07-02T16:15:29Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.638277Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-8vxj-4cph-c596","published":"2025-06-04T21:22:27Z","modified":"2025-07-02T18:32:15Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-48935"],"summary":"Deno has --allow-read / --allow-write permission bypass in `node:sqlite`","details":"## Summary\n\nIt is possible to bypass Deno's read/write permission checks by using `ATTACH DATABASE` statement.\n\n## PoC\n\n```js\n// poc.js\nimport { DatabaseSync } from \"node:sqlite\"\n\nconst db = new DatabaseSync(\":memory:\");\ndb.exec(\"ATTACH DATABASE 'test.db' as test;\");\n\ndb.exec(\"CREATE TABLE test.test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);\");\n```\n\n```\n$ deno poc.js\n```","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.2.0"},{"fixed":"2.2.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-8vxj-4cph-c596/GHSA-8vxj-4cph-c596.json"}},{"package":{"name":"deno_node","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno_node"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.129.0"},{"fixed":"0.134.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-8vxj-4cph-c596/GHSA-8vxj-4cph-c596.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-8vxj-4cph-c596"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48935"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/31a97803995bd94629528ba841b2418d3ca01860"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-04T21:22:27Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-06-04T20:15:24Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.652566Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-7w8p-chxq-2789","published":"2025-06-04T21:18:18Z","modified":"2025-07-02T18:31:08Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-48934"],"related":["CVE-2025-48934"],"summary":"Deno.env.toObject() ignores the variables listed in --deny-env and returns all environment variables","details":"### Summary\nThe [Deno.env.toObject](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/~/Deno.Env.toObject) method ignores any variables listed in the `--deny-env` option of the `deno run` command.

Zero Ethereum invalid commitment with digest value of zero accepted by Steel.validateCommitment","details":"### Impact\n\nPrior to 2.1.1 and 2.2.0, the `Steel.validateCommitment` Solidity library function will return `true` for a crafted commitment with a digest value of zero.\n\nThis violates the semantics of `validateCommitment`, as this does not commitment to a block that is in the current chain. Because the digest is zero, it does not correspond to any block and there exist no known openings. As a result, this commitment will never be produced by a correct zkVM guest using Steel. Leveraging this bug to compromise the soundness of an application using Steel would require a separate bug or misuse of the Steel library, which is expected to be used to validate the root of state opening proofs (e.g. having the guest commit to a digest of zero, or failing to check the zkVM proof).\n\nBecause this bug does not risk application integrity, correctly written applications are not at risk.\n\n### Fix\n\nPlease see [#605] for a full description of the bug, and the fix. This fix has been released as part of `risc0-ethereum` [2.1.1] and [2.2.0].\n\n### Recommended actions\n\nUsers for the `Steel` Solidity library versions 2.1.0 or earlier should ensure they are using `Steel.validateCommitment` in tandem with zkVM proof verification of a Steel program, as shown in the [ERC-20 counter example][example], and [documentation]. This is the correct usage of Steel, and users following this pattern are not at risk, and do not need to take action.\n\nUsers not verifying a zkVM proof of a Steel program should update their application to do so, as this is incorrect usage of Steel.\n\n### Credit\n\nA thank you to Daniel526 on HackenProof for reporting this issue\n\n[#605]:

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

Only once a configurable timeout has passed will the user have to re-authenticate themselves. Supporting this functionality is a set of session files (timestamps) for each user, stored in `/var/run/sudo-rs/ts`. These files are named according to the username from which the sudo attempt is made (the origin user).\n\n### Impact\n\nAn issue was discovered where usernames containing the `.` and `/` characters could result in the corruption of specific files on the filesystem. As usernames are generally not limited by the characters they can contain, a username appearing to be a relative path can be constructed. For example we could add a user to the system containing the username `../../../../bin/cp`. When logged in as a user with that name, that user could run `sudo -K` to clear their session record file. The session code then constructs the path to the session file by concatenating the username to the session file storage directory, resulting in a resolved path of `/bin/cp`. The code then clears that file, resulting in the `cp` binary effectively being removed from the system.\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to login as a user with a constructed username. Given that such a username is unlikely to exist on an existing system, they will also need to be able to create the users with the constructed usernames.\n\n### Patches\nThe bug is fixed in version 0.2.1 of sudo-rs. Sudo-rs now uses the uid for the user instead of their username for determining the filename. Note that an upgrade to this version will result in existing session files being ignored and users will be forced to re-authenticate. It also fully eliminates any possibility of path traversal, given that uids are always integer values.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe `sudo -K` and `sudo -k` commands can run, even if a user has no sudo access. Make sure that your system does not contain any users with a specially crafted username. While this is the case and while untrusted users do not have the ability to create arbitrary users on your system you should not be able to exploit this issue.\n\n### References\nThis issue was identified by Andrea Jegher from Radically Open Security during an audit of the sudo-rs code.

snapshots for Cardano database could be compromised by an adversary","details":"### Impact\n\n#### Mithril certification of Cardano database\n\nThe Mithril network provides certification for snapshots of the Cardano database, enabling users to quickly bootstrap a Cardano node without relying on the slower peer-to-peer synchronization process.\n\nTo generate a multi-signature, a minimum threshold of Cardano stake registered in the protocol must agree on signing the same message. In this context, a digest is computed from the internal files of the Cardano node's database. However, this mechanism has certain limitations. Specifically, some files are not identically generated across all Cardano nodes, and there is no API to provide consistent snapshots at a specific beacon on the Cardano chain:\n\n- All immutable files, except the last one (which is still being created), are used to compute the message\n- The last immutable file is excluded from the signature\n- The ledger state files are also excluded from the signature.\n\n#### Cardano node startup sequence\n\nA Cardano node can only perform a fast bootstrap if a pre-computed ledger state is loaded into its database; otherwise, a full re-computation is required, which is time-consuming. During the startup phase with a pre-computed ledger state, the node performs structural verification of the ledger state and lightweight conformity checks which may not be enough to systematically detect invalid ledger state.\n\n#### Attack scenarios\n\nInconsistencies could be introduced into a tampered ledger state distributed through Mithril snapshots, either by an unknown source or by a compromised IOG-operated aggregator. These inconsistencies would not be immediately detected by Cardano nodes started with such snapshots, potentially enabling long-range attacks that might not be corrected by honest nodes, even if they sync from genesis.\n\nCurrently, a Mithril network has only one aggregator, which serves snapshots from a secure cloud location operated by IOG and is therefore assumed to be trustworthy.

A valid WebAssembly module, when executed at runtime, may cause this panic. The panic in question is caused when a WebAssembly module issues a `table.*` instruction which uses a dropped element segment with a table that also has an `externref` type. This causes Wasmtime to erroneously use an empty function segment instead of an empty externref segment to perform this operation. This mismatch in types causes a panic in Wasmtime when it's asserted that an externref table is only viewed as externrefs.\n\nThis regression was introduced during the development of the 19.0.0 release and only affects the 19.0.0 release. This panic requires the `reference-types` WebAssembly feature to be enabled, and it is enabled by default. Toolchains are not known to generate this pattern by default so it's likely a module would need to be specifically crafted to trigger this panic.\n\nA panic in a host runtime represents a possible denial-of-service in some scenarios. This panic cannot introduce memory unsafety or allow WebAssembly to break outside of its sandbox, however. There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic.\n\n### Patches\n\nWasmtime 19.0.1 has been released to fix this problem. Users of 19.0.0 should upgrade to 19.0.1. All other versions of Wasmtime are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not possible it's recommended to use `config.reference_types(false)`. That will disable these modules at validation-time which prevents the possibility of a panic at runtime. If reference-types are required, however, then there is no other workaround at this time other than upgrading.\n\n### References\n\n* [Original bug report](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8281)\n* [PR to fix the bug](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8283)\n* [PR that introduced the bug](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8018)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"19.0.0"},{"fixed":"19.0.1"}]}],"versions":["19.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/04/GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5/GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-75hq-h6g9-h4q5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30266"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8281"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8018"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8283"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/7f57d0bb0948fa56cc950278d0db230ed10e8664"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0441.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-843"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-04-02T21:09:23Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-04-04T16:15:09Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.646946Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg","published":"2024-10-09T19:14:03Z","modified":"2025-05-02T12:54:33Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-47763","RUSTSEC-2024-0440"],"related":["CGA-3652-mr4r-qqj4","CGA-5pmq-xv7p-wxxq","CGA-qxpw-wpcp-p399"],"summary":"wasmtime has a runtime crash when combining tail calls with trapping imports","details":"### Impact\n\nWasmtime's implementation of WebAssembly tail calls combined with stack traces can result in a runtime crash in certain WebAssembly modules. The runtime crash may be undefined behavior if Wasmtime was compiled with Rust 1.80 or prior. The runtime crash is a deterministic process abort when Wasmtime is compiled with Rust 1.81 and later.\n\n[WebAssembly tail calls](https://github.com/webassembly/tail-call) are a proposal which relatively recently reached stage 4 in the [standardization process](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals/). Wasmtime first enabled support for tail calls by default [in Wasmtime 21.0.0](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8540), although that release contained a bug where it was only on-by-default for some configurations. In [Wasmtime 22.0.0](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8682) tail calls were enabled by default for all configurations.\n\nThe specific crash happens when an exported function in a WebAssembly module (or component) performs a `return_call` (or `return_call_indirect` or `return_call_ref`) to an imported host function which captures a stack trace (for example, the host function raises a trap). In this situation, the stack-walking code previously assumed there was always at least one WebAssembly frame on the stack but with tail calls that is no longer true. With the tail-call proposal it's possible to have an entry trampoline appear as if it directly called the exit trampoline. This situation triggers an internal assert in the stack-walking code which raises a Rust `panic!()`.\n\nWhen Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.80 and prior this means that an `extern \"C\"` function in Rust is raising a `panic!()`. This is technically undefined behavior and typically manifests as a process abort when the unwinder fails to unwind Cranelift-generated frames. When Wasmtime is compiled with Rust versions 1.81 and later this panic becomes a deterministic process abort.\n\nOverall the impact of this issue is that this is a denial-of-service vector where a malicious WebAssembly module or component can cause the host to crash. There is no other impact at this time other than availability of a service as the result of the crash is always a crash and no more.\n\nThis issue was discovered by routine fuzzing performed by the Wasmtime project via Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure. We have no evidence that it has ever been exploited by an attacker in the wild.\n\n### Patches\n\nAll versions of Wasmtime which have tail calls enabled by default have been patched:\n\n* 21.0.x - patched in 21.0.2\n* 22.0.x - patched in 22.0.1\n* 23.0.x - patched in 23.0.3 \n* 24.0.x - patched in 24.0.1\n* 25.0.x - patched in 25.0.2\n\nWasmtime versions from 12.0.x (the first release with experimental tail call support) to 20.0.x (the last release with tail-calls off-by-default) have support for tail calls but the support is disabled by default. These versions are not affected in their default configurations, but users who explicitly enabled tail call support will need to either disable tail call support or upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe main workaround for this issue is to disable tail support for tail calls in Wasmtime, for example with [`Config::wasm_tail_call(false)`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_tail_call). Users are otherwise encouraged to upgrade to patched versions.\n\n### References\n\n* [Wasmtime's initial implementation of tail calls](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6774)\n* [Enabling of tail calls in 21.0.0](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8540)\n* [Fully enabling tail calls in 22.0.0](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8682)\n* [The WebAssembly's `tail-call` proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/tail-call)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"12.0.0"},{"fixed":"21.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/10/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"22.0.0"},{"fixed":"22.0.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/10/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"23.0.0"},{"fixed":"23.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/10/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"24.0.0"},{"fixed":"24.0.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/10/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"25.0.0"},{"fixed":"25.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/10/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-q8hx-mm92-4wvg"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47763"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6774"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8540"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/8682"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/0ebe54d05f0e1f6c64b7c8bb48c9e9f6c95cacba"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_tail_call"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/webassembly/tail-call"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0440.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-617","CWE-670"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-10-09T19:14:03Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-10-09T18:15:08Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.674239Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-7qmx-3fpx-r45m","published":"2024-10-09T19:14:35Z","modified":"2025-05-02T12:54:18Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-47813","RUSTSEC-2024-0439"],"related":["CGA-gjjh-q4xg-fjw4","CGA-vx7v-xf4j-jwqg","CGA-x6r2-g5c2-44p2"],"summary":"Wasmtime race condition could lead to WebAssembly control-flow integrity and type safety violations","details":"### Impact\n\nUnder certain concurrent event orderings, a `wasmtime::Engine`'s internal type registry was susceptible to double-unregistration bugs due to a race condition, leading to panics and potentially type registry corruption. That registry corruption could, following an additional and particular sequence of concurrent events, lead to violations of WebAssembly's control-flow integrity (CFI) and type safety. Users that do not use `wasmtime::Engine` across multiple threads are not affected. Users that only create new modules across threads over time are additionally not affected.\n\nReproducing this bug requires creating and dropping multiple type instances (such as `wasmtime::FuncType` or `wasmtime::ArrayType`) concurrently on multiple threads, where all types are associated with the same `wasmtime::Engine`. **Wasm guests cannot trigger this bug.** See the \"References\" section below for a list of Wasmtime types-related APIs that are affected.\n\nWasmtime maintains an internal registry of types within a `wasmtime::Engine` and an engine is shareable across threads. Types can be created and referenced through creation of a `wasmtime::Module`, creation of `wasmtime::FuncType`, or a number of other APIs where the host creates a function (see \"References\" below). Each of these cases interacts with an engine to deduplicate type information and manage type indices that are used to implement type checks in WebAssembly's `call_indirect` function, for example. This bug is a race condition in this management where the internal type registry could be corrupted to trigger an assert or contain invalid state.\n\nWasmtime's internal representation of a type has individual types (e.g. one-per-host-function) maintain a registration count of how many time it's been used. Types additionally have state within an engine behind a read-write lock such as lookup/deduplication information. The race here is a time-of-check versus time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug where one thread atomically decrements a type entry's registration count, observes zero registrations, and then acquires a lock in order to unregister that entry. However, between when this first thread observed the zero-registration count and when it acquires that lock, another thread could perform the following sequence of events: re-register another copy of the type, which deduplicates to that same entry, resurrecting it and incrementing its registration count; then drop the type and decrement its registration count; observe that the registration count is now zero; acquire the type registry lock; and finally unregister the type. Now, when the original thread finally acquires the lock and unregisters the entry, it is the second time this entry has been unregistered.\n\n| Thread A                          | Thread B                       |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| `acquire(type registry lock)`     |                                |\n|                                   | `decref(E) --> 0`              |\n|                                   | `block_on(type registry lock)` |\n| `register(E') == incref(E) --> 1` |                                |\n| `release(type registry lock)`     |                                |\n| `decref(E) --> 0`                 |                                |\n| `acquire(type registry lock)`     |                                |\n| `unregister(E)`                   |                                |\n| `release(type registry lock)`     |                                |\n|                                   | `acquire(type registry lock)`  |\n|                                   | `unregister(E)`          |\n\n\nThis double-unregistration could then lead to a WebAssembly CFI violation under the following conditions: a new WebAssembly module `X` was loaded into the engine before the second, buggy unregistration occurs; `X` defined a function type `F` that was allocated in the same type registry slot where the original entry was allocated; the second, buggy unregistration incorrectly unregistered `F`; another new WebAssembly module `Y` was loaded into the engine; `Y` defined a function type `G`, different from `F`, but which is also allocated in the same type registry slot; a `funcref` of type `G` is created, either by the host or by Wasm; that `funcref` is passed to a WebAssembly instance of module `X`; that instance performs a `call_indirect` to that `funcref`; the `call_indirect`'s dynamic type check, which preserves CFI, could incorrectly pass in this case, because `F` and `G` were assigned the same type registry slot. This would, ultimately, allow calling a function with too many, too few, or wrongly-typed arguments, violating CFI and type safety.\n\nWe were not able to reproduce this CFI violation in a vanilla Wasmtime build, although it remains theoretically possible. However, by modifying Wasmtime's source code to make losing the races described above more likely (by disabling certain assertions, inserting panic catches, and adding retry loops in a few places if we did *not* lose the race) we were able to incorrectly get a `funcref` to pass a type check that it should have failed, which would allow the CFI violation.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug was originally introduced in Wasmtime 19's development of the WebAssembly GC proposal. This bug affects users who are not using the GC proposal, however, and affects Wasmtime in its default configuration even when the GC proposal is disabled. Wasmtime users using 19.0.0 and after are all affected by this issue. We have released the following Wasmtime versions, all of which have a fix for this bug:\n\n* 21.0.2\n* 22.0.1\n* 23.0.3\n* 24.0.1\n* 25.0.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf your application creates and drops Wasmtime types on multiple threads concurrently, there are no known workarounds. Users are encouraged to upgrade to a patched release. \n\n### References\n\nThe following APIs create or drop types, and therefore are affected by this race condition if performed on multiple threads

Only x86_64 is affected so all other targets are not affected by this. The miscompilation results in the instruction producing an incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second lane of the vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the input vector instead of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this issue is that any WebAssembly program using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce an incorrect result.\n\nThis issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox. Execution of WebAssembly guest programs will still behave correctly with respect to memory sandboxing and isolation from the host. Wasmtime considers non-spec-compliant behavior as a security issue nonetheless.\n\nThis issue was discovered through fuzzing of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.\n\n### Patches\n\nWasmtime versions 10.0.2, 11.0.2, and 12.0.2 are all patched to no longer have this miscompilation.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis issue only affects x86_64 hosts and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm modules which is nontrivial or to [disable the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd).

This undefined behavior was found to cause runtime-level issues when compiled with LLVM 16 which causes some writes, which are critical for correctness, to be optimized away. Vulnerable versions of Wasmtime compiled with Rust 1.70, which is currently in beta, or later are known to have incorrectly compiled functions. Versions of Wasmtime compiled with the current Rust stable release, 1.69, and prior are not known at this time to have any issues, but can theoretically exhibit potential issues.\n\nThe underlying problem is that Wasmtime's runtime state for an instance involves a Rust-defined structure called `Instance` which has a trailing `VMContext` structure after it. This `VMContext` structure has a runtime-defined layout that is unique per-module. This representation cannot be expressed with safe code in Rust so `unsafe` code is required to maintain this state. The code doing this, however, has methods which take `&self` as an argument but modify data in the `VMContext` part of the allocation. This means that pointers derived from `&self` are mutated. This is typically not allowed, except in the presence of `UnsafeCell`, in Rust. When compiled to LLVM these functions have `noalias readonly` parameters which means it's UB to write through the pointers.\n\nWasmtime's internal representation and management of `VMContext` has been updated to use `&mut self` methods where appropriate. Additionally verification tools for `unsafe` code in Rust, such as `cargo miri`, are planned to be executed on the `main` branch soon to fix any Rust-level issues that may be exploited in future compiler versions.\n\nPrecomplied binaries available for Wasmtime from GitHub releases have been compiled with at most LLVM 15 so are not known to be vulnerable. As mentioned above, however, it's still recommended to update.\n\n### Patches\n\nWasmtime version 6.0.2, 7.0.1, and 8.0.1 have been issued which contain the patch necessary to work correctly on LLVM 16 and have no known UB on LLVM 15 and earlier. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf Wasmtime is compiled with Rust 1.69 and prior, which use LLVM 15, then there are no known issues. There is a theoretical possibility for UB to exploited, however, so it's recommended that users upgrade to a patched version of Wasmtime. Users using beta Rust (1.70 at this time) or nightly Rust (1.71 at this time) must update to a patched version to work correctly.\n\n### References\n\n* [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-ch89-5g45-qwc7)\n* [Mailing list announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/bytecodealliance.org/g/sec-announce/c/ecK-6G2yi90)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to us on [the Bytecode Alliance Zulip chat](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime)\n* Open an issue in [the bytecodealliance/wasmtime repository](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/04/GHSA-ch89-5g45-qwc7/GHSA-ch89-5g45-qwc7.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"fixed":"7.0.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/04/GHSA-ch89-5g45-qwc7/GHSA-ch89-5g45-qwc7.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"8.0.0"},{"fixed":"8.0.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/04/GHSA-ch89-5g45-qwc7/GHSA-ch89-5g45-qwc7.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-ch89-5g45-qwc7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30624"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/0977952dcd9d482bff7c288868ccb52769b3a92e"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/a/bytecodealliance.org/g/sec-announce/c/ecK-6G2yi90"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0092.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-758"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-04-27T17:08:37Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-04-27T17:15:08Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.657023Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-xm67-587q-r2vw","published":"2023-03-09T00:09:03Z","modified":"2025-05-02T12:52:23Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-27477","RUSTSEC-2023-0093"],"related":["CGA-r89w-g3fx-79jw"],"summary":"wasmtime vulnerable to miscompilation of `i8x16.select` with the same inputs on x86_64","details":"### Impact\n\nWasmtime's code generation backend, Cranelift, has a bug on x86_64 platforms for the WebAssembly `i8x16.select` instruction which will produce the wrong results when the same operand is provided to the instruction and some of the selected indices are greater than 16. There is an off-by-one error  in the calculation of the mask to the `pshufb` instruction which causes incorrect results to be returned if lanes are selected from the second vector.\n\nThe impact of this miscompilation is that the WebAssembly instruction can produce incorrect results for the `i8x16.select` instruction. This should have no effect on embedders and does not represent a sandbox escape, for example. Guest programs, however, may behave unexpectedly due to the incorrect result of this instruction. In extreme cases if a guest program is handling untrusted input then the guest program may deviate from its intended execution, for example calling an imported host function with different arguments than intended. This still does not impact embedders, however, because there is no form of privilege escalation with the guest.\n\nAt this time it's expected that this codegen pattern doesn't show up in the wild that often. LLVM-generated modules, for example, do not appear to conventionally or idiomatically generate code which would hit this bug. It is possible, however, to still write code which triggers this, so it's recommended for embedders to analyze existing modules to see if any are affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis codegen bug has been fixed in Wasmtime 6.0.1, 5.0.1, and 4.0.1. Users are recommended to upgrade to these updated versions.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid this miscompilation by [disabling the Wasm simd proposal](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd)\n\n```rust\nconfig.wasm_simd(false);\n```\n\nAdditionally the bug is only present on x86_64 hosts.

This bug means that, with default codegen settings, a wasm-controlled load/store operation could read/write addresses up to 35 bits away from the base of linear memory. Wasmtime's default sandbox settings provide up to 6G of protection from the base of linear memory to guarantee that any memory access in that range will be semantically correct. Due to this bug, however, addresses up to `0xffffffff * 8 + 0x7ffffffc = 36507222004 = ~34G` bytes away from the base of linear memory are possible from guest code. This means that the virtual memory 6G away from the base of linear memory up to ~34G away can be read/written by a malicious module.\n\nThis out of bounds read/write is not semantically correct and poses a threat as an arbitrary read/write within ~34G of linear memory away from the base of a wasm module's linear memory. A guest module can, without the knowledge of the embedder, read/write memory in this region. The memory may belong to other WebAssembly instances when using the pooling allocator, for example. The memory may also belong to the embedder, depending on address layout.\n\nEmbedders do not have a necessarily reliable means of detecting when this happens. Wasm loads/stores are allowed to cause machine segfaults meaning that an invalid read/write would be translated to a nominal WebAssembly trap. This means that a malicious module in the worst case silently reads/writes memory outside its bounds and in the \"best\" case looks like a normal \"something trapped here\" during its execution. This makes it difficult to retroactively determine whether this bug has been exploited on hosts. Affected embedders are recommended to analyze preexisting wasm modules to see if they're affected by the incorrect codegen rules and possibly correlate that with an anomalous number of traps during historical execution to locate possibly suspicious modules.\n\nThe specific bug in Cranelift's x86_64 backend is that a WebAssembly address which is left-shifted by a constant amount from 1 to 3 will get folded into x86_64's addressing modes which perform shifts. For example `(i32.load (i32.shl (local.get 0) (i32.const 3)))` loads from the WebAssembly address `$local0 << 3`. When translated to Cranelift the `$local0 << 3` computation, a 32-bit value, is zero-extended to a 64-bit value and then added to the base address of linear memory. Cranelift would generate an instruction of the form `movl (%base, %local0, 8), %dst` which calculates `%base + %local0 << 3`. The bug here, however, is that the address computation happens with 64-bit values, where the `$local0 << 3` computation was supposed to be truncated to a 32-bit value. This means that `%local0`, which can use up to 32-bits for an address, gets 3 extra bits of address space to be accessible via this `movl` instruction.\n\nThe fix in Cranelift is to remove the erroneous lowering rules in the backend which handle these zero-extended expressions. The above example is then translated to `movl %local0, %temp; shl $3, %temp; movl (%base, %temp), %dst` which correctly truncates the intermediate computation of `%local0 << 3` to 32-bits inside the `%temp` register which is then added to the `%base` value.\n\n### Patches\n\nWasmtime version 4.0.1, 5.0.1, and 6.0.1 have been released and have all been patched to no longer contain the erroneous lowering rules.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhile updating Wasmtime is recommended, there are a number of possible workarounds that embedders can employ to mitigate this issue if updating is not possible. Note that none of these workarounds are on-by-default and require explicit configuration:\n\n* The `Config::static_memory_maximum_size(0)` option can be used to force all accesses to linear memory to be explicitly bounds-checked. This will perform a bounds check separately from the address-mode computation which correctly calculates the effective address of a load/store. Note that this can have a large impact on the execution performance of WebAssembly modules.\n* The `Config::static_memory_guard_size(1 << 36)` option can be used to greatly increase the guard pages placed after linear memory. This will guarantee that memory accesses up-to-34G away are guaranteed to be semantically correct by reserving unmapped memory for the instance. Note that this reserves a very large amount of virtual memory per-instances and can greatly reduce the maximum number of concurrent instances being run.\n* If using a non-x86_64 host is possible, then that will also work around this bug. This bug does not affect Wasmtime's or Cranelift's AArch64 backend, for example.\n\n### References\n\n* [`Config::static_memory_maximum_size`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.static_memory_maximum_size)\n* [`Config::static_memory_guard_size`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.static_memory_guard_size)\n* [Mailing list announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/bytecodealliance.org/g/sec-announce/c/Mov-ItrNJsQ)\n* [GitHub advisory](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8)\n* [Commit to fix this issue on Wasmtime's `main` branch](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/63fb30e4b4415455d47b3da5a19d79c12f4f2d1f)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to us on [the Bytecode Alliance Zulip chat](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime)\n* Open an issue in [the bytecodealliance/wasmtime repository](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.37.0"},{"fixed":"4.0.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/03/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"5.0.0"},{"fixed":"5.0.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/03/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/03/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cranelift-codegen","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cranelift-codegen"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.84.0"},{"fixed":"0.91.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/03/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cranelift-codegen","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cranelift-codegen"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.92.0"},{"fixed":"0.92.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/03/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"cranelift-codegen","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cranelift-codegen"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.93.0"},{"fixed":"0.93.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/03/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-ff4p-7xrq-q5r8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26489"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/63fb30e4b4415455d47b3da5a19d79c12f4f2d1f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.static_memory_guard_size"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.static_memory_maximum_size"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/a/bytecodealliance.org/g/sec-announce/c/Mov-ItrNJsQ"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0090.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125","CWE-787"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-03-09T00:10:53Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-03-08T20:15:00Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.659105Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-h84q-m8rr-3v9q","published":"2024-02-01T00:15:47Z","modified":"2025-05-02T12:51:45Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-39394","RUSTSEC-2022-0097"],"summary":"wasmtime_trap_code C API function has out of bounds write vulnerability","details":"### Impact\n\nThere is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the definition of the `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h` header file.

The pooling instance allocator in Wasmtime works by preallocating virtual memory for a fixed number of instances to reside in and then new instantiations pick a slot to use. Most conventional modules additionally have an initial copy-on-write \"heap image\" which is mapped in Wasmtime into the linear memory slot. When a heap slot is deallocated Wasmtime resets all of its contents back to the initial state but it does not unmap the image in case the next instance is an instantiation of the same module.\n\nThe bug in Wasmtime occurs when a slot in the pooling allocator previously was used for a module with a heap image, meaning that its current state of memory contains the initial heap contents of that module. If the next instantiation within that slot does not itself contain a heap image then Wasmtime would leave the old heap image in place erroneously and continue with instantiation. This means that instantiations of modules without a heap image can see the initial heap image of the prior instantiation within that slot.\n\nHeap images in Wasmtime are created by precomputing WebAssembly `data` segments into one large mapping to be placed into linear memory at a particular offset. Most modules produced by toolchains today will have a heap image and an initialization snapshot. Creating a module without a heap image would require a hand-crafted `*.wat` file or a specially crafted source program. This consequence means that this bug is highly unlikely to be accidentally triggered and would otherwise require an intentional trigger with a hand-crafted module.\n\nOne important part of this vulnerability is Wasmtime is highly likely to segfault when the slot is reused again with a module that itself has an initialization image. For example if module A has a heap initialization image and module B does not have a heap initialization image, then the following sequence of events could happen if they all are instantiated into the same instance slot:\n\n* Module A is instantiated, and then deallocated. This leaves A's heap image in place, reset to its initial contents.\n* Module B is instantiated and erroneously can see the initial heap contents of A. Module B is then deallocated and the entire heap is unmapped and reset back to zero.\n* Module A is instantiated again, but the state tracking the slot did not account for module B so it thinks the module image is still mapped and proceeds with instantiation. Any action on A's part to access linear memory will then trap and if the host accesses A's memory it will segfault because the data that's supposed to be mapped is all unmapped.\n\nAdding this all together this means that in practice modules must be deliberately crafted to not have an initial heap image to view the contents of a prior image. If this module is instantiated though then when the slot is reused the next, likely image-using, module will believe its memory is mapped when it isn't, causing the host to segfault on unmapped memory it believed was mapped. \n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTrigging this bug requires the pooling allocator to be configured and for copy-on-write heap images to also be enabled. Pooling allocation is not enabled by default but copy-on-write heap images are. Mitigations for this bug include:\n\n* Disabling the pooling allocator - note that pooling allocation is not enabled by default in Wasmtime\n* Disabling the `memory-init-cow` feature or with [`Config::memory_init_cow`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/2.0.1/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.memory_init_cow)\n\n### References\n\n* [`Config::allocation_strategy`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/2.0.1/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.allocation_strategy) - configuration required to enable the pooling allocator.\n* [`Config::memory_init_cow`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/2.0.1/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.memory_init_cow) - configuration required to enable or disable copy-on-write (this is enabled by default).\n* [Mailing list announcement](https://groups.google.com/a/bytecodealliance.org/g/sec-announce/c/c1HBDDJwNPA)\n* [Patch for `release-2.0.0` branch](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/2614f2e9d2d36805ead8a8da0fa0c6e0d9e428a0)\n* [Patch for `main`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/3535acbf3be032ef1ba0b469b8ab92538a8a18a6)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to us on [the Bytecode Alliance Zulip chat](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime)\n* Open an issue in [the bytecodealliance/wasmtime repository](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/11/GHSA-wh6w-3828-g9qf/GHSA-wh6w-3828-g9qf.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/11/GHSA-wh6w-3828-g9qf/GHSA-wh6w-3828-g9qf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-wh6w-3828-g9qf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39393"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/2614f2e9d2d36805ead8a8da0fa0c6e0d9e428a0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/3535acbf3be032ef1ba0b469b8ab92538a8a18a6"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/a/bytecodealliance.org/g/sec-announce/c/c1HBDDJwNPA"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0075.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0098.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-212","CWE-226"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-11-10T21:16:22Z","nvd_published_at":"2022-11-10T20:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.683426Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-44mr-8vmm-wjhg","published":"2022-11-10T21:09:02Z","modified":"2025-05-02T12:49:46Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-39392","RUSTSEC-2022-0076","RUSTSEC-2022-0102"],"summary":"Wasmtime out of bounds read/write with zero-memory-pages configuration","details":"### Impact\n\nThere is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this configuration the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created by the pooling allocator.\n\nThis bug can only be triggered by setting [`InstanceLimits::memory_pages`](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/2.0.1/wasmtime/struct.InstanceLimits.html#structfield.memory_pages) to zero. This is expected to be a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any production embedding of Wasmtime, hence the low severity of this bug despite the critical consequences.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOne way to mitigate this issue is to disable usage of the pooling allocator. Note that the pooling allocator is not enabled by default.\n\nThis bug can also only be worked around by increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to still prevent memory from actually being used then the `Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of memory beyond 0 bytes large.

The translation rules for constants did not take into account whether sign- or zero-extension should happen, which resulted in an incorrect value being placed into a register when a division was encountered. For example, a constant 32-bit unsigned divisor of `0xfffffffe` would be incorrectly sign-extended to 64-bits to `0xfffffffffffffffe`. Any kind of division of operands smaller than 64 bits is implemented with a 64-bit division instruction which would then result in an incorrect result because the divisor was larger than expected.\n\nThe impact of this bug is that programs executing within the WebAssembly sandbox would not behave according to the WebAssembly specification. This means that it is hypothetically possible for execution within the sandbox to go awry and WebAssembly programs could produce unexpected results. This should not impact hosts executing WebAssembly, but does affect the correctness of guest programs.\n\nThis bug was found with differential fuzzing of Wasmtime against other engines on the AArch64 platform. Fuzzing on AArch64 is not regularly performed at this time and the Wasmtime team is investigating how best to continuously fuzz AArch64 in the same manner as x86_64.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.38.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not an option at this time, direct users of Cranelift that control the exact Cranelift instructions being compiled can avoid the vulnerability by explicitly extending constant divisors to 64 bits using either the `sextend.i64` or the `uextend.i64` operation.\n\nNote, though, that this issue only affects the AArch64 targets.

The aarch64 implementation of the simd proposal is not affected. The bugs were presented in the `i8x16.swizzle` and `select` WebAssembly instructions. The `select` instruction is only affected when the inputs are of `v128` type. The correspondingly affected Cranelift instructions were `swizzle` and `select`.\n\nThe `swizzle` instruction lowering in Cranelift erroneously overwrote the mask input register which could corrupt a constant value, for example. This means that future uses of the same constant may see a different value than the constant itself.\n\nThe `select` instruction lowering in Cranelift wasn't correctly implemented for vector types that are 128-bits wide. When the condition was 0 the wrong instruction was used to move the correct input to the output of the instruction meaning that only the low 32 bits were moved and the upper 96 bits of the result were left as whatever the register previously contained (instead of the input being moved from). The `select` instruction worked correctly if the condition was nonzero, however.\n\nThis bug in Wasmtime's implementation of these instructions on x86_64 represents an incorrect implementation of the specified semantics of these instructions according to the [WebAssembly specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/). The impact of this is benign for hosts running WebAssembly but represents possible vulnerabilities within the execution of a guest program. For example a WebAssembly program could take unintended branches or materialize incorrect values internally which runs the risk of exposing the program itself to other related vulnerabilities which can occur from miscompilations.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe have released Wasmtime 0.38.1 and cranelift-codegen (and other associated cranelift crates) 0.85.1 which contain the corrected implementations of these two instructions in Cranelift.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid the vulnerability by [disabling the Wasm simd proposal](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_simd)\n\n```rust\nconfig.wasm_simd(false);\n```\n\nAdditionally the bug is only present on x86_64 hosts.

If you are not explicitly enabling epoch interruption (it is disabled by default) then you are not affected. If you are explicitly disabling the Wasm reference types proposal (it is enabled by default) then you are also not affected.\n\nThe use after free is caused by Cranelift failing to emit stack maps when there are safepoints inside cold blocks. Cold blocks occur when epoch interruption is enabled. Cold blocks are emitted at the end of compiled functions, and change the order blocks are emitted versus defined. This reordering accidentally caused Cranelift to skip emitting some stack maps because it expected to emit the stack maps in block definition order, rather than block emission order. When Wasmtime would eventually collect garbage, it would fail to find live references on the stack because of the missing stack maps, think that they were unreferenced garbage, and therefore reclaim them. Then after the collection ended, the Wasm code could use the reclaimed-too-early references, which is a use after free.\n\nThis bug was discovered while extending our fuzz targets for `externref`s and GC in Wasmtime. The updated fuzz target thoroughly exercises these code paths and feature combinations now. We have also added a regression test for this bug.

If upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid the vulnerability by either disabling the Wasm reference types proposal or by disabling epoch interruption if you were previously enabling it.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.34.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/04/GHSA-gwc9-348x-qwv2/GHSA-gwc9-348x-qwv2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.35.0"},{"fixed":"0.35.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/04/GHSA-gwc9-348x-qwv2/GHSA-gwc9-348x-qwv2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-gwc9-348x-qwv2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24791"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/666c2554ea0e1728c35aa41178cf235920db888a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.epoch_interruption"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0016.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0099.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-04-01T13:36:12Z","nvd_published_at":"2022-03-31T23:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.662812Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-88xq-w8cq-xfg7","published":"2022-02-16T22:35:03Z","modified":"2025-05-02T12:48:30Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-23636","CVE-2022-31169","GHSA-7f6x-jwh5-m9r4","RUSTSEC-2022-0096","RUSTSEC-2022-0101"],"summary":"Invalid drop of partially-initialized instances in the pooling instance allocator for modules with defined `externref` globals ","details":"### Impact\n\nThere exists a bug in the pooling instance allocator in Wasmtime's runtime where a failure to instantiate an instance for a module that defines an `externref` global will result in an invalid drop of a `VMExternRef` via an uninitialized pointer.\n\nAs instance slots may be reused between consecutive instantiations, the value of the uninitialized pointer may be from a previous instantiation and therefore under the control of an attacker via a module's initial values for its globals. If the attacker can somehow determine an address under their control inside the mapped memory representing the instance pool, it is possible to trick the runtime to call `drop_in_place` on a trait object under the attacker's control and therefore cause remote code execution.\n\nExploiting the bug to cause remote code execution would be very difficult as attackers cannot determine the addresses of globals from code executing within the WebAssembly VM and the memory space for the instance pool cannot be statically determined. Operating system mitigations, such as [address space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization), would additionally increase the difficulty for attackers to determine useful executable code to target with an exploit. It is also very unlikely that attackers will be able to directly influence the conditions that trigger the bug as described below.\n\nWhen the conditions to trigger the bug are met, however, it is much easier to exploit this bug to cause a denial of service by crashing the host with an invalid memory read.\n\nThe following engine configuration (via [Config](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.34.0/wasmtime/struct.Config.html)) is required to be impacted by this bug:\n\n* support for the reference types proposal must be enabled (this is the default for `Config`).\n* a pooling allocation strategy must be configured via [Config::allocation_strategy](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.34.0/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.allocation_strategy), which is **not the default allocation strategy**.\n\nA module must be instantiated with **all the following characteristics**:\n\n* The module defines at least one table or memory.\n* The module defines at least one `externref` global.\n\nDuring instantiation, **one of the following** must occur to cause the instantiation to fail:\n\n* a call to `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc` fails (e.g. out-of-memory conditions).\n* a resource limiter was configured in the associated `Store` (via [Store::limiter](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.34.0/wasmtime/struct.Store.html#method.limiter) or [Store::limiter_async](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/0.34.0/wasmtime/struct.Store.html#method.limiter_async)) and the limiter returns `false` from the initial call to `memory_growing` or `table_growing`. **Stores do not have a resource limiter set by default**.\n\nThis results in a partially-initialized instance being dropped and that attempts to drop the uninitialized `VMExternRef` representing the defined `externref` global.\n\nWe have reason to believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because the usage of `externref` is still uncommon and without a resource limiter configured on the `Store`, which is not the default configuration, it is only possible to trigger the bug from an error returned by `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc`.\n\nNote that on Linux with the `uffd` feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the bug from a resource limiter as the call to `mprotect` is skipped; if no resource limiter is used, then this configuration is not vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug has been fixed in 0.34.1 and 0.33.1; users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf it is not possible to upgrade to 0.34.1 or 0.33.1 of the `wasmtime` crate, it is recommend that support for the reference types proposal be disabled by passing `false` to [Config::wasm_reference_types](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.wasm_reference_types).\n\nDoing so will prevent modules that use `externref` from being loaded entirely.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to us on [the Bytecode Alliance Zulip

For example, `surreal start --allow-net --deny-net 10.0.0.0/8` will allow all network connections except to the 10.0.0.0/8 block.\n\nAn authenticated user of SurrealDB can use redirects to bypass this restriction. For example by hosting a server on the public internet which redirects to the IP addresses blocked by the administrator of the SurrealDB server via HTTP 301 or 307 response codes. \n\nWhen sending SurrealDB statements containing the `http::*` functions to the attacker controlled host, the SurrealDB server will follow the redirects to the blocked IP address. Because the statements also return the responses to the attacker, this issue constitutes a full SSRF vulnerability.\n\nThis issue was discovered and patched during an code audit and penetration test of SurrealDB by cure53, the severity as defined within cure53's preliminary finding is Medium, matched by our CVSS v4 assessment.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is circumvention of the `--deny-net` capability and resulting impact on systems external to SurrealDB. The ultimate impact is dependent on the deployment scenario. \n\nFor example, if the SurrealDB server blocks requests to internal and private IP addresses because they run services which don't require authentication, such as AWS deployments using IMDSv1, the attacker can access these internal endpoints directly, and potentially retrieve or even alter sensitive information and credentials.\n\nThe circumvention could also be used to redirect traffic to the SurrealDB port, providing a low level of impact to availability. \n\n### Patches\nA patch has been created that adds an HTTP redirect limit, and checks HTTP redirects against allowed network targets, preventing redirections to disallowed uri's.\n\n- Versions 2.0.5, 2.1.5, 2.2.2 and later are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe possibility of this vulnerability being exploited can be reduced by following an allowlist approach to enabling the http capability `surreal start --allow-net 10.0.0.0/8 ` or using the equivalent `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_NET` environment variable,  where endpoints allowed are fully trusted and are not controlled by regular users.\n\nThe network access capability can be disabled, using `--deny-net` or the equivalent `SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_NET` environment variable without specifying targets, with impact to SurrealDB functionality.\n\nAs the impact of this vulnerability depends on the security of the deployment environment of SurrealDB, best practices should be followed within that environment.\n\n\n### References\n[#5597](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/5597)\n[SurrealDB Documentation - Environment Variables](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/cli/env)\n[SurrealDB Documentation - Capabilities](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities)\n[SurrealDB Documentation - Network Access Capability](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities#network)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.2.0"},{"fixed":"2.2.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-5q9x-554g-9jgg/GHSA-5q9x-554g-9jgg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.1.0"},{"fixed":"2.1.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-5q9x-554g-9jgg/GHSA-5q9x-554g-9jgg.json"}},{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-5q9x-554g-9jgg/GHSA-5q9x-554g-9jgg.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-5q9x-554g-9jgg"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/5597"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-11T14:09:37Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.642834Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-pxw4-94j3-v9pf","published":"2025-04-11T14:09:14Z","modified":"2025-04-11T14:09:14Z","summary":"SurrealDB CPU exhaustion via custom functions result in total DoS","details":"SurrealDB allows authenticated users with `OWNER` or `EDITOR` permissions at the root, database or namespace levels to define their own database functions using the `DEFINE FUNCTION` statement\n\nA custom database function comprises a name together with a function body.

This can lead to deletion of media that was not uploaded by the banned/purged user. This also applies to purged communities, in which case all media posted in that community will get deleted without proper ownership check.\nThis is limited to media with an `image/*` content-type returned by pict-rs.\n\n### Details\nLemmy did not associate users with media uploads until version 0.19.0 ([#3927](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3927)).\nBack when the first parts of content purging were implemented for 0.17.0 ([#1809](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/1809)), it was therefore not possible to properly identify media belonging to a specific user for situations in which this data should get erased from pict-rs, Lemmy's media storage backend.\n\nPict-rs deduplicates uploaded files transparently. As a result, it has two types of media deletion. A regular deletion will only remove the referenced alias, and if there are not other aliases pointing to the same file, the backing file will also be deleted. A purge on the other hand will delete all aliases pointing to the specified file, as well as the file itself.\n\nThe logic implemented in 0.17.0 iterated over media URLs related to users and communities when purging them and purged them from pict-rs. This results in a full deletion of the backing media, even if either the same URL was the result of an upload by a different user, or the same media being uploaded by another user with a different alias.\nFor user purges, Lemmy iterated over all posts they created and applied this to all media referenced in post URLs and post thumbnails. For community purges, this applied to all posts within this community.\n\nAdditionally, the deletion of user avatars, banners, as well as the media from all their posts was implemented when users were banned with content removal. This includes local bans and also bans received via federation, when a user gets banned on their home instance.\n\nThe function for purging images from pict-rs performs a check at the start to verify that the media `Content-Type` header returned by pict-rs starts with `image/`, which limits this to not affect other media types supported by Lemmy and pict-rs, such as videos.\n\n### Impact\n\n#### Instances with open federation\nThe vast majority of Lemmy instances has open federation, which means that this can be exploited remotely without any authentication.\n\n#### Instances with limited or no federation\nExploitation requires user interaction by an admin of the targeted instance or a federation-linked instance if federation is enabled.\nIt may also require authentication, as instances may not have open registrations.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lemmy_server","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/lemmy_server"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.17.0"},{"fixed":"0.19.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-wr2m-38xh-rpc9/GHSA-wr2m-38xh-rpc9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/security/advisories/GHSA-wr2m-38xh-rpc9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/1809"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3927"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/5566"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-708"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-08T17:38:59Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.684014Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0021","published":"2025-04-03T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-04-08T07:10:04Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-31130","GHSA-2frx-2596-x5r6"],"summary":"SHA-1 collision attacks are not detected","details":"### Summary\ngitoxide uses SHA-1 hash implementations without any collision detection, leaving it vulnerable to hash collision attacks.\n\n### Details\ngitoxide uses the `sha1_smol` or `sha1` crate, both of which implement standard SHA-1 without any mitigations for collision attacks. This means that two distinct Git objects with colliding SHA-1 hashes would break the Git object model and integrity checks when used with gitoxide.\n\nThe SHA-1 function is considered cryptographically insecure. However, in the wake of the SHAttered attacks, this issue was mitigated in Git 2.13.0 in 2017 by using the [sha1collisiondetection](https://github.com/crmarcstevens/sha1collisiondetection) algorithm by default and producing an error when known SHA-1 collisions are detected. Git is in the process of migrating to using SHA-256 for object hashes, but this has not been rolled out widely yet and gitoxide does not support SHA-256 object hashes.\n\n### PoC\nThe following program demonstrates the problem, using the two [SHAttered PDFs](https://shattered.io/):\n\n```rust\nuse sha1_checked::{CollisionResult, Digest};\n\nfn sha1_oid_of_file(filename: &str) -> gix::ObjectId {\n    let mut hasher = gix::features::hash::hasher(gix::hash::Kind::Sha1);\n    hasher.update(&std::fs::read(filename).unwrap());\n    gix::ObjectId::Sha1(hasher.digest())\n}\n\nfn sha1dc_oid_of_file(filename: &str) -> Result<gix::ObjectId, String> {\n    // Matches Git’s behaviour.\n    let mut hasher = sha1_checked::Builder::default().safe_hash(false).build();\n    hasher.update(&std::fs::read(filename).unwrap());\n    match hasher.try_finalize() {\n        CollisionResult::Ok(digest) => Ok(gix::ObjectId::Sha1(digest.into())),\n        CollisionResult::Mitigated(_) => unreachable!(),\n        CollisionResult::Collision(digest) => Err(format!(\n            \"Collision attack: {}\",\n            gix::ObjectId::Sha1(digest.into()).to_hex()\n        )),\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    dbg!(sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\"));\n}\n```\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n```\n[src/main.rs:24:5] sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\") = Sha1(38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a)\n[src/main.rs:25:5] sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\") = Sha1(38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a)\n[src/main.rs:26:5] sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\") = Err(\n    \"Collision attack: 38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a\",\n)\n[src/main.rs:27:5] sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\") = Err(\n    \"Collision attack: 38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a\",\n)\n```\n\nThe latter behaviour matches Git.\n\nSince the SHAttered PDFs are not in a valid format for Git objects, a direct proof‐of‐concept using higher‐level APIs cannot be immediately demonstrated without significant computational resources.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker with the ability to mount a collision attack on SHA-1 like the [SHAttered](https://shattered.io/) or [SHA-1 is a Shambles](https://sha-mbles.github.io/) attacks could create two distinct Git objects with the same hash.

The result could be used to disguise malicious repository contents, or potentially exploit assumptions in Jujutsu’s logic to cause further vulnerabilities.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"jj-lib","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/jj-lib"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.28.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-794x-2rpg-rfgr/GHSA-794x-2rpg-rfgr.json"}},{"package":{"name":"jj-cli","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/jj-cli"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.28.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-794x-2rpg-rfgr/GHSA-794x-2rpg-rfgr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/security/advisories/GHSA-794x-2rpg-rfgr"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/commit/350da7d013773377aec0d3a4bf4374d3c941460e"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-328"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-07T16:40:25Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.647808Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-2frx-2596-x5r6","published":"2025-04-04T16:06:08Z","modified":"2025-04-04T16:06:09Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-31130","RUSTSEC-2025-0021"],"related":["CVE-2025-31130"],"summary":"gitoxide does not detect SHA-1 collision attacks","details":"### Summary\ngitoxide uses SHA-1 hash implementations without any collision detection, leaving it vulnerable to hash collision attacks.\n\n### Details\ngitoxide uses the `sha1_smol` or `sha1` crate, both of which implement standard SHA-1 without any mitigations for collision attacks. This means that two distinct Git objects with colliding SHA-1 hashes would break the Git object model and integrity checks when used with gitoxide.\n\nThe SHA-1 function is considered cryptographically insecure. However, in the wake of the SHAttered attacks, this issue was mitigated in Git 2.13.0 in 2017 by using the [sha1collisiondetection](https://github.com/crmarcstevens/sha1collisiondetection) algorithm by default and producing an error when known SHA-1 collisions are detected. Git is in the process of migrating to using SHA-256 for object hashes, but this has not been rolled out widely yet and gitoxide does not support SHA-256 object hashes.\n\n### PoC\nThe following program demonstrates the problem, using the two [SHAttered PDFs](https://shattered.io/):\n\n```rust\nuse sha1_checked::{CollisionResult, Digest};\n\nfn sha1_oid_of_file(filename: &str) -> gix::ObjectId {\n    let mut hasher = gix::features::hash::hasher(gix::hash::Kind::Sha1);\n    hasher.update(&std::fs::read(filename).unwrap());\n    gix::ObjectId::Sha1(hasher.digest())\n}\n\nfn sha1dc_oid_of_file(filename: &str) -> Result<gix::ObjectId, String> {\n    // Matches Git’s behaviour.\n    let mut hasher = sha1_checked::Builder::default().safe_hash(false).build();\n    hasher.update(&std::fs::read(filename).unwrap());\n    match hasher.try_finalize() {\n        CollisionResult::Ok(digest) => Ok(gix::ObjectId::Sha1(digest.into())),\n        CollisionResult::Mitigated(_) => unreachable!(),\n        CollisionResult::Collision(digest) => Err(format!(\n            \"Collision attack: {}\",\n            gix::ObjectId::Sha1(digest.into()).to_hex()\n        )),\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    dbg!(sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\"));\n}\n```\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n```\n[src/main.rs:24:5] sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\") = Sha1(38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a)\n[src/main.rs:25:5] sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\") = Sha1(38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a)\n[src/main.rs:26:5] sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\") = Err(\n    \"Collision attack: 38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a\",\n)\n[src/main.rs:27:5] sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\") = Err(\n    \"Collision attack: 38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a\",\n)\n```\n\nThe latter behaviour matches Git.\n\nSince the SHAttered PDFs are not in a valid format for Git objects, a direct proof‐of‐concept using higher‐level APIs cannot be immediately demonstrated without significant computational resources.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker with the ability to mount a collision attack on SHA-1 like the [SHAttered](https://shattered.io/) or [SHA-1 is a Shambles](https://sha-mbles.github.io/) attacks could create two distinct Git objects with the same hash.

programs on the system. The [`open`](https://tauri.app/reference/javascript/shell/#open) endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. \n `xdg-open` on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like `https` or `mailto` by default.\n\nThis default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like `file://`, `smb://`, or `nfs://` and others  to be opened by the system registered protocol handler.\n\nBy passing untrusted user input to the `open` endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application.\n\nYou are not affected if you have explicitly configured a validation regex or manually set the `open` endpoint to `true` in the plugin configuration. \n\nTechnically the scope was never a limitation for the rust side as it is not seen as an enforceable security boundary but we decided to mark the rust crate as affected since the plugin does not need to be a frontend dependency to be exposed.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in the `2.2.1` version of the plugin.\nThe plugin now differentiates between an unset scope and an explicit validation disable for the `open` endpoint.\n\n### Workarounds \n\nA way to prevent arbitrary protocols would be setting the shell plugin configuration value `open` to `true`.\n\n`tauri.conf.json`\n```json5 \n\"plugins\": {\n    \"shell\": {\n          \"open\": true\n     },\n}\n```\n\nThe above will only allow `mailto`, `http` and `https` links to be opened.\n\nIf the `open` endpoint should not be allowed at all there are two possible workarounds.\n- Defining a non matching regex like `tauri^` in the plugin configuration\n- Removing `shell:default` and all instances of `shell:allow-open` from the [`capabilities`](https://tauri.app/security/capabilities/) \n\nAlternatively we recommend usage of the [`opener`](https://tauri.app/plugin/opener/)  plugin, as the shell plugin deprecated the `open` endpoint previously.\n### References\n\n#### PoC\n\nThis is a windows specific proof of concept.\n\n1.

Code that uses the item and then advances the iterator is unaffected. This problem has always existed.\n\nThis is a use-after-free bug, so it's rated high severity. If your code uses a pre-3.0.0 version of cassandra-rs, and uses an item returned by a cassandra-rs iterator after calling `next()` on that iterator, then it is vulnerable.

This leads to excessive memory consumption and potential system instability, which can be exploited to disrupt Redlib instances. This vulnerability was introduced in 2e95e1fc6e2064ccfae87964b4860bda55eddb9a and fixed in 15147cea8e42f6569a11603d661d71122f6a02dc.\n\n### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis vulnerability allows a remote attacker with network access to exploit the preference restoration mechanism by providing a compressed payload that expands dramatically upon decompression. The issue arises because the system automatically decompresses user-supplied data without enforcing size limits, potentially leading to:\n\n- Out-of-memory (OOM) conditions\n- OS-level resource exhaustion, potentially leading to broader system instability or crashes\n- Repeated exploitation, keeping the target system in a persistent degraded state\n- Denial-of-service of any public instance\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in 15147cea8e42f6569a11603d661d71122f6a02dc. Users should upgrade to v0.36.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nUntil a patch is available, users can:\n\n- Implement request size limits at the web server or application level to reject excessively large

step outside of the target directory by creating a symlink to the parent directory and then extracting further files through that symlink.\n\nThe documentation of the

[`::zip::read::FileOptions::enclosed_name`] ... is resistant to path-based exploits ... can’t resolve to a path outside the current directory.\n\n\nMost archive software either decline to extract

allows unprivileged access to rpm-ostree D-Bus `Deploy()` and `FinalizeDeployment()` methods","details":"### Impact\n\nZincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the following actions:\n- `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy`: used to deploy updates to the system\n- `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment`: used to reboot the system into the deployed update\n\nSince Zincati [v0.0.24](https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.24), this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user.\n\nIn practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload.\n\nThis primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. The fix is included in the following FCOS releases:\n- On the `stable` stream: 41.20250302.3.2\n- On the `testing` stream: 41.20250315.2.0\n- On the `next` stream: 42.20250316.1.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA workaround is to add the following polkit rule:\n\n```javascript\npolkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {\n    if (action.id == \"org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy\" ||\n        action.id == \"org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment\" ||\n        action.id == \"org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.cleanup\") {\n        if (subject.user != \"zincati\") {\n                return polkit.Result.NO;\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nto e.g. `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/00-zincati-fix.rules` (it must sort earlier than `zincati.rules` lexicographically).\n\nNote that this rule will deny all non-root users other than `zincati` from using those actions. If you've added polkit rules to allow e.g. the `core` user or other users, you will need to adjust the policy (or make sure the ordering is appropriate).\n\n### References\n\nThis issue was introduced by [this commit](https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/28a43aa2c1edda091ba659677d73c13e6e3ea99d), and is fixed in [v0.0.30](https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.30).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"zincati","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/zincati"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.24"},{"fixed":"0.0.30"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.0.29","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/security/advisories/GHSA-w6fv-6gcc-x825"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27512"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/01d8e89f799e6ba21bdf7dc668abce23bd0d8f78"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/commit/28a43aa2c1edda091ba659677d73c13e6e3ea99d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/coreos/zincati"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.24"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coreos/zincati/releases/tag/v0.0.30"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-783","CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-17T14:46:56Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-17T15:15:44Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.682630Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-89xp-c3mq-qj84","published":"2025-03-17T00:30:21Z","modified":"2025-03-17T15:27:07.899212Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-30089"],"summary":"gurk (aka gurk-rs) mishandles ANSI escape sequences","details":"gurk (aka gurk-rs) through 0.6.3 mishandles ANSI escape sequences.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gurk","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gurk"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.6.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-89xp-c3mq-qj84/GHSA-89xp-c3mq-qj84.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30089"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/boxdot/gurk-rs/issues/384"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://crates.io/crates/gurk"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/boxdot/gurk-rs"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-150"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-17T14:45:39Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-03-17T00:15:13Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.650652Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0014","published":"2025-03-08T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-03-13T00:41:50Z","withdrawn":"2025-03-12T12:00:00Z","summary":"humantime is unmaintained","details":"Latest `humantime` crates.io release is four years old and GitHub repository has\nnot seen commits in four years.

The following alternative mitigations have been identified:\n* Rebuild locally with runtime overflow checks disabled\n* Rebuild locally using a fixed version of the `ring` dependency (0.17.12 or later).\n\n### Detail\n\nThe upstream advisory describes a crash in the implementation of the QUIC protocol that can be induced by a specially-crafted packet, and which happens naturally approximately every 1 in 2**32 packets sent and/or received.\n\nThe crash only happens when runtime overflow checking is enabled. Note that the upstream advisory describes the overflow check causing this issue as \"unwanted\". Their response, to remove the overflow check in one place, does not introduce any additional issue.\n\n### Impact\n\nDuring qcp file transfer sessions, it is possible for an attacker to send a specially-crafted packet that could trigger this issue.\n* In that case, and only if qcp was built with runtime overflow checks enabled, the effect is a Rust panic which immediately aborts the transfer. There is no additional impact on system resources at either end, nor on other file transfers in progress.\n* As qcp runs a separate process for every connected user, the impact of the attack is limited to a single session.\n\nThe underlying issue may also affect particularly large file transfers. The maximum TLS packet size is 16KB, so 2**32 packets will transfer up to 68TB (including the protocol/retransmit overhead). Again, this is only the case if qcp was built with runtime overflow checks enabled.\n\nAs of the time of writing, we are not aware of any reports of this issue being exploited.\n\n#### Additional notes\n* The qcp protocol itself does not rely on runtime overflow checks for its security.\n* While QUIC servers are normally public-facing, [qcp is a hybrid protocol](https://docs.rs/qcp/latest/qcp/protocol/index.html) that first requires an authenticated ssh session in order to set up the QUIC session. The window of attackability is therefore reduced, though will depend on your usage profile.\n* An additional layer of obscurity is provided by qcp using ephemeral, random port numbers for its QUIC traffic (subject to user configuration).\n\n### References\nUpstream advisories:\n* [RUSTSEC-2025-0009](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html)\n* https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6","affected":[{"package":{"name":"qcp","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/qcp"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.3.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/03/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/crazyscot/qcp/security/advisories/GHSA-fmwf-c46w-r8qm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/RELEASES.md#version-01712-2025-03-05"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/crazyscot/qcp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-03-08T01:30:18Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.659911Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0013","published":"2025-02-21T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-03-07T15:52:15Z","summary":"resolve is unmaintained","details":"resolve crate's GitHub repository is archived with no commits for seven years.\nLatest crates.io release is also seven years old.\n\n## Possible alternatives\n\n * [hickory-resolver](https://crates.io/crates/hickory-resolver)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"resolve","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/resolve"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":null,"informational":"unmaintained","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2025-0013.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/resolve"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0013.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/murarth/resolve"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.721821Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0011","published":"2025-03-04T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-03-07T15:47:21Z","summary":"`openpgp-card-sequoia` is unmaintained.","details":"The [openpgp-card-sequoia](https://crates.io/crates/openpgp-card-sequoia) crate is no longer actively maintained.

For example:\n\nNot vulnerable - the server buffer has a `'static` lifetime:\n```rust\nbuilder.set_alpn_select_callback(|_, client_protos| {\n    ssl::select_next_proto(b\"\\x02h2\", client_protos).ok_or_else(AlpnError::NOACK)\n});\n```\n\nNot vulnerable - the server buffer outlives the handshake:\n```rust\nlet server_protos = b\"\\x02h2\".to_vec();\nbuilder.set_alpn_select_callback(|_, client_protos| {\n    ssl::select_next_proto(&server_protos, client_protos).ok_or_else(AlpnError::NOACK)\n});\n```\n\nVulnerable - the server buffer is freed when the callback returns:\n```rust\nbuilder.set_alpn_select_callback(|_, client_protos| {\n    let server_protos = b\"\\x02h2\".to_vec();\n    ssl::select_next_proto(&server_protos, client_protos).ok_or_else(AlpnError::NOACK)\n});\n```\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/pull/2360","affected":[{"package":{"name":"openssl","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/openssl"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.10.0"},{"fixed":"0.10.70"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-rpmj-rpgj-qmpm/GHSA-rpmj-rpgj-qmpm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/security/advisories/GHSA-rpmj-rpgj-qmpm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24898"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/pull/2360"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/commit/f014afb230de4d77bc79dea60e7e58c2f47b60f2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://crates.io/crates/openssl"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00009.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0004.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-03T17:56:46Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-02-03T18:15:43Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.678430Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-7723-35v7-qcxw","published":"2025-02-10T20:25:37Z","modified":"2025-02-11T00:33:48Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-25194"],"summary":"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in activitypub_federation","details":"### Summary\nThis vulnerability allows a user to bypass any predefined hardcoded URL path or security anti-Localhost mechanism and perform an arbitrary GET request to any Host, Port and URL using a Webfinger Request.\n\n### Details\nThe Webfinger endpoint takes a remote domain for checking accounts as a feature, however, as per the ActivityPub spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#security-considerations), on the security considerations section at B.3, access to Localhost services should be prevented while running in production.\nThe library attempts to prevent Localhost access using the following mechanism (/src/config.rs):\n```rust\npub(crate) async fn verify_url_valid(&self, url: &Url) -> Result<(), Error> {\n        match url.scheme() {\n            \"https\" => {}\n            \"http\" => {\n                if !self.allow_http_urls {\n                    return Err(Error::UrlVerificationError(\n                        \"Http urls are only allowed in debug mode\",\n                    ));\n                }\n            }\n            _ => return Err(Error::UrlVerificationError(\"Invalid url scheme\")),\n        };\n\n        // Urls which use our local domain are not a security risk, no further verification needed\n        if self.is_local_url(url) {\n            return Ok(());\n        }\n\n        if url.domain().is_none() {\n            return Err(Error::UrlVerificationError(\"Url must have a domain\"));\n        }\n\n        if url.domain() == Some(\"localhost\") && !self.debug {\n            return Err(Error::UrlVerificationError(\n                \"Localhost is only allowed in debug mode\",\n            ));\n        }\n\n        self.url_verifier.verify(url).await?;\n\n        Ok(())\n    }\n```\nThere are multiple issues with the current anti-Localhost implementation: \n\n1. It does not resolve the domain address supplied by the user.\n2. The Localhost check is using only a simple comparison method while ignoring more complex malicious tampering attempts.\n3. It filters only localhost domains, without any regard for alternative local IP domains or other sensitive domains, such internal network or cloud metadata domains.\n\nWe can reach the verify_url_valid function while sending a Webfinger request to lookup a user’s account (/src/fetch/webfinger.rs):\n\n```rust\npub async fn webfinger_resolve_actor<T: Clone, Kind>(\n    identifier: &str,\n    data: &Data<T>,\n) -> Result<Kind, <Kind as Object>::Error>\nwhere\n    Kind: Object + Actor + Send + 'static + Object<DataType = T>,\n    for<'de2> <Kind as Object>::Kind: serde::Deserialize<'de2>,\n    <Kind as Object>::Error: From<crate::error::Error> + Send + Sync + Display,\n{\n    let (_, domain) = identifier\n        .splitn(2, '@')\n        .collect_tuple()\n        .ok_or(WebFingerError::WrongFormat.into_crate_error())?;\n    let protocol = if data.config.debug { \"http\" } else { \"https\" };\n    let fetch_url =\n        format!(\"{protocol}://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}\");\n    debug!(\"Fetching webfinger url: {}\", &fetch_url);\n\n    let res: Webfinger = fetch_object_http_with_accept(\n        &Url::parse(&fetch_url).map_err(Error::UrlParse)?,\n        data,\n        &WEBFINGER_CONTENT_TYPE,\n    )\n    .await?\n    .object;\n\n    debug_assert_eq!(res.subject, format!(\"acct:{identifier}\"));\n    let links: Vec<Url> = res\n        .links\n        .iter()\n        .filter(|link| {\n            if let Some(type_) = &link.kind {\n                type_.starts_with(\"application/\")\n            } else {\n                false\n            }\n        })\n        .filter_map(|l| l.href.clone())\n        .collect();\n\n    for l in links {\n        let object = ObjectId::<Kind>::from(l).dereference(data).await;\n        match object {\n            Ok(obj) => return Ok(obj),\n            Err(error) => debug!(%error, \"Failed to dereference link\"),\n        }\n    }\n    Err(WebFingerError::NoValidLink.into_crate_error().into())\n}\n```\n\nThe Webfinger logic takes the user account from the GET parameter “resource” and sinks the domain directly into the hardcoded Webfinger URL (“{protocol}://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}”) without any additional checks.\nAfterwards the user domain input will pass into the “fetch_object_http_with_accept” function and finally into the security check on “verify_url_valid” function, again, without any form of sanitizing or input validation.\nAn adversary can cause unwanted behaviours using multiple techniques:\n\n1. **_Gaining control over the query’s path:_**\nAn adversary can manipulate the Webfinger hard-coded URL, gaining full control over the GET request domain, path and port by submitting malicious input like: hacker@hacker_host:1337/hacker_path?hacker_param#, which in turn will result in the following string:\nhttp[s]://hacker_host:1337/hacker_path?hacker_param#/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{identifier}, directing the URL into another domain and path without any issues as the hash character renders the rest of the URL path unrecognized by the webserver.\n\n2. **_Bypassing the domain’s restriction using DNS resolving mechanism:_**\nAn adversary can manipulate the security check and force it to look for internal services regardless the Localhost check by using a domain name that resolves into a local IP (such as: localh.st, for example), as the security check does not verify the resolved IP at all - any service under the Localhost domain can be reached.\n\n3. _**Bypassing the domain’s restriction using official Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs):**_\nIn the official DNS specifications, a fully qualified domain name actually should end with a dot.\nWhile most of the time a domain name is presented without any trailing dot, the resolver will assume it exists, however - it is still possible to use a domain name with a trailing dot which will resolve correctly.\nAs the Localhost check is mainly a simple comparison check - if we register a “hacker@localhost.” domain it will pass the test as “localhost” is not equal to “localhost.”, however the domain will be valid (Using this mechanism it is also possible to bypass any domain blocklist mechanism).\n\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Activate a local HTTP server listening to port 1234 with a “secret.txt” file:\n`python3 -m http.server 1234`\n2. Open the “main.rs” file inside the “example” folder on the activitypub-federated-rust project, and modify the “beta@localhost” string into “hacker@localh.st:1234/secret.txt?something=1#”.\n3. Run the example using the following command:\n`cargo run --example local_federation axum`\n4. View the console of the Python’s HTTP server and see that a request for a “secret.txt” file was performed.\n\nThis proves that we can redirect the URL to any domain and path we choose.\nNow on the next steps we will prove that the security checks of Localhost and blocked domains can be easily bypassed (both checks use the same comparison mechanism).\n\n1. Now open the “instance.rs” file inside the “example” folder and view that the domain “malicious.com” is blocked (you can switch it to any desired domain address).\n2. Change the same “beta@localhost” string into “hacker@malicious.com” and run the example command to see that the malicious domain blocking mechanism is working as expected.\n3. Now change the “hacker@malicious.com” string into  “hacker@malicious.com.” string and re-initiate the example, view now that the check passed successfully.\n4. You can combine both methods on “localhost.” domain (or any other domain) to verify that the FQDNs resolving is indeed successful.\n\n\n### Impact\nDue to this issue, any user can cause the server to send GET requests with controlled path and port in an attempt to query services running on the instance’s host, and attempt to execute a Blind-SSRF gadget in hope of targeting a known vulnerable local service running on the victim’s machine.\n\n### Fix Suggestion\nModify the domain validation mechanism and implement the following checks:\n\n1. Resolve the domain and validate it is not using any invalid IP address (internal, or cloud metadata IPs) using regexes of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\nFor Implementation example of a good SSRF prevention practice you can review a similiar project such as “Fedify” (https://github.com/dahlia/fedify/blob/main/src/runtime/url.ts) which handles external URL resource correctly.\nNote that it is still needed to remove unwanted characters from the URL. \n2. Filter the user’s input for any unwanted characters that should not be present on a domain name, such as #,?,/, etc.\n3. Perform checks that make sure the desired request path is the executed path with the same port.\n4. Disable automatic HTTP redirect follows on the implemented client, as redirects can be used for security mechanisms circumvention.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"activitypub_federation","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/activitypub_federation"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.6.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-7723-35v7-qcxw/GHSA-7723-35v7-qcxw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/security/advisories/GHSA-7723-35v7-qcxw"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25194"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/activitypub-federation-rust"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-10T20:25:37Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-02-10T23:15:16Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.647459Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4","published":"2025-02-10T17:46:00Z","modified":"2025-02-10T19:51:23Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-25188"],"related":["CGA-fvhf-w665-9w4r","CGA-jrmw-jf8x-m44p","CGA-xg6x-7c9v-q5x3"],"summary":"Hickory DNS's DNSSEC validation may accept broken authentication chains","details":"### Summary\nThe DNSSEC validation routines treat entire RRsets of DNSKEY records as trusted once they have established trust in only one of the DNSKEYs. As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.\n\n### Details\n`verify_dnskey_rrset()` will return `Ok(true)` if any record's public key matches a trust anchor. This results in `verify_rrset()` returning a `Secure` proof. This ultimately results in successfully verifying a response containing DNSKEY records. `verify_default_rrset()` looks up DNSKEY records by calling `handle.lookup()`, which takes the above code path. There's a comment following this that says \"DNSKEYs were already validated by the inner query in the above lookup\", but this is not the case. To fully verify the whole RRset of DNSKEYs, it would be necessary to check self-signatures by the trusted key over the other keys. Later in `verify_default_rrset()`, `verify_rrset_with_dnskey()` is called multiple times with different keys and signatures, and if any call succeeds, then its `Proof` is returned.\n\nSimilarly, `verify_dnskey_rrset()` returns `Ok(false)` if any DNSKEY record is covered by a DS record. A comment says \"If all the keys are valid, then we are secure\", but this is only checking that one key is authenticated by a DS in the parent zone's delegation point. This time, after control flow returns to `verify_rrset()`, it will call `verify_default_rrset()`. The special handling for DNSKEYs in `verify_default_rrset()` will then call `verify_rrset_with_dnskey()` using each KSK DNSKEY record, and if one call succeeds, return its `Proof`. If there are multiple KSK DNSKEYs in the RRset, then this leads to another authentication break. We need to either pass the authenticated DNSKEYs from the DS covering check to the RRSIG validation, or we need to perform this RRSIG validation of the DNSKEY RRset inside `verify_dnskey_rrset()` and cut `verify_default_rrset()` out of DNSKEY RRset validation entirely.\n\n### PoC\nThe proof of concepts have been integrated into the conformance test suite, as `resolver::dnssec::scenarios::bogus::bogus_zone_plus_trust_anchor_dnskey` and `resolver::dnssec::scenarios::bogus::bogus_zone_plus_ds_covered_dnskey`.\n\n### Impact\nThis impacts Hickory DNS users relying on DNSSEC verification in the client library, stub resolver, or recursive resolver.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hickory-proto","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hickory-proto"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.8.0"},{"fixed":"0.24.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/02/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-37wc-h8xc-5hc4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25188"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/commit/e118c6eec569f4340421f86ee0686714010c63e9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-345"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-02-10T17:46:00Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-02-10T18:15:35Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.635778Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-mjv9-vp6w-3rc9","published":"2023-04-26T16:01:10Z","modified":"2025-02-05T16:42:43Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-30610"],"related":["CVE-2023-30610"],"summary":"AWS SDK for Rust will log AWS credentials when TRACE-level logging is enabled for request sending","details":"The `aws_sigv4::SigningParams` struct had a derived `Debug` implementation.

Perhaps due to unfamiliarity with core substrate APIs.  The `if` statement should have included a negation check, similar to the previous code, but this was omitted. Causing the verifier to **only** accept invalid signatures.\n\nThis vulnerability remained undetected even with [integration tests](https://github.com/polytope-labs/ismp-substrate/pull/64/commits/04d5be207b082eb61d586d52e1685e2e060347e6#diff-4aedbca82d26bebc03f274e23fd5697c3346ffff54405c87af9018f3aef708b2R1-R160), as the prover was also [misconfigured](https://github.com/polytope-labs/ismp-substrate/pull/64/commits/b26894913b301061b07db61af841ca2586415f08#diff-493a6129d75fe31185e28695a4d2adc1582fe9df12462e380fe994f170fc1e70L159) to initialize the Grandpa verifier with the incorrect authority `set_id`. This causes verification of honest precommit signatures to fail as the message is now malformed, but  the verifier indeed only accepts signatures or messages that fail the verification check.\n\nBut even more devastatingly, the verifier will also accept malicious GRANDPA signatures for any precommit message.\n\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in this [commit](https://github.com/polytope-labs/hyperbridge/pull/372/commits/f0e85db718f5165b06585a49b14a66f8ad643aea) and a patch release has been published.\n\n### Impact\nThis could be used to steal

On a Unix-like system such as GNU/Linux or macOS, create a new project and define its dependencies. While the vulnerability is in `gix-worktree-state`, this example will use vulnerable code through the `gix` crate, which exposes it. Run:\n\n   ```sh\n   cargo new checkout-index\n   cd checkout-index\n   cargo add gix gix-object\n   ```\n\n2. In the `checkout-index` directory, edit `src/main.rs` so that its entire contents are:\n\n   ```rust\n   fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n       let repo = gix::discover(\"has-executable\")?;\n       let mut index = repo.open_index()?;\n       gix::worktree::state::checkout(\n           &mut index,\n           repo.work_dir().ok_or(\"need non-bare repo\")?,\n           gix_object::find::Never, // Can also use: repo.objects.clone()\n           &gix::progress::Discard,\n           &gix::progress::Discard,\n           &Default::default(),\n           Default::default(),\n       )?;\n       Ok(())\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Create the test repository that the vulnerable program will operate on. Still in the `checkout-index` directory, run:\n\n   ```sh\n   git init has-executable\n   touch has-executable/a has-executable/b\n   chmod +x has-executable/b\n   git -C has-executable add .\n   ```\n\n   It is not necessary to commit the changes, only to stage them, since the test program will check  out the index.\n\n4. *Optionally*, run `rm has-executable/[ab]` to remove the staged files from disk.\n\n5. Run the program by issuing `cargo run`. The program uses `gix-worktree-state` to check out the index. It should terminate successfully and not issue any errors.\n\n6. Run `ls -l has-executable` to inspect the permissions of the checked out files. Observe that owner, group, and other all have read, write, and execute permissions on `b`.\n\n   ```text\n   -rw-r--r-- 1 ek ek 0 Jan  9 03:38 a\n   -rwxrwxrwx 1 ek ek 0 Jan  9 03:38 b\n   ```\n\n   With affected versions of `gix-worktree-state`, the output shows `-rwxrwxrwx` for `b`, whether the files were removed in step 4 or not.\n\n7. It was not necessary to set `destination_is_initially_empty` to `false` explicitly to trigger the bug, because that is its default value. If desired, modify the program to pass `true` and rerun the experiment to verify that `b` is no longer created with excessive permissions. The modified program would change the last `checkout` argument from `Default::default(),` to:\n\n   ```rust\n           gix::worktree::state::checkout::Options {\n               destination_is_initially_empty: true,\n               ..Default::default()\n           },\n   ```\n\n### Impact\n\nSetting unlimited file permissions is a problem on systems where a user account exists on the system that should not have the ability to access and modify the files. That applies to multi-user systems, or when an account is used to run software with reduced abilities. (Some programs may also treat broad write permissions to mean less validation is required.)\n\nThis bug affects Unix-like systems but not Windows. The `gix clone` command is not believed to be affected, due to [`checkout_exclusive`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/af704f57bb9480c47cdd393465264d586f1d4562/gitoxide-core/src/index/checkout.rs#L14-L172)'s [use](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/af704f57bb9480c47cdd393465264d586f1d4562/gitoxide-core/src/index/checkout.rs#L61) of `destination_is_initially_empty: true`. Specialized uses in which repositories are known never to have any files marked executable are unaffected. Repositories that no untrusted users can access, due to not having the ability to traverse the directories to them or due to sufficiently restrictive ACLs, are likewise unaffected.\n\nThe default value of `destination_is_initially_empty` is `false`, so some applications may be affected even if they don't attempt checkouts in nonempty directories. The 0777 permissions are applied to files that are created earlier in the same checkout, as well as those that already existed, regardless of their prior permissions. On preexisting files, 0777 is set *even if [`overwrite_existing`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/8d84818240d44e1f5fe78a231b5d9bffd0283918/gix-worktree-state/src/checkout/mod.rs#L54-L58) is `false`*, as that prevents the checkout from changing file contents but not permissions.\n\nFiles not tracked/staged as executable are not checked out with insecure permissions. Such a file that previously existed keeps its old permissions. However, this may include executable permissions that no longer match repository metadata, as well as undesired write permissions acquired from a previous vulnerable checkout. `set_mode(0o777)` clears other bits, so the bug is not exacerbated by the presence of setuid/setgid bits.

While the vulnerability is in `gix-worktree-state`, this example will use vulnerable code through the `gix` crate, which exposes it. Run:\n\n   ```sh\n   cargo new checkout-index\n   cd checkout-index\n   cargo add gix gix-object\n   ```\n\n2. In the `checkout-index` directory, edit `src/main.rs` so that its entire contents are:\n\n   ```rust\n   fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n       let repo = gix::discover(\"has-executable\")?;\n       let mut index = repo.open_index()?;\n       gix::worktree::state::checkout(\n           &mut index,\n           repo.work_dir().ok_or(\"need non-bare repo\")?,\n           gix_object::find::Never, // Can also use: repo.objects.clone()\n           &gix::progress::Discard,\n           &gix::progress::Discard,\n           &Default::default(),\n           Default::default(),\n       )?;\n       Ok(())\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Create the test repository that the vulnerable program will operate on. Still in the `checkout-index` directory, run:\n\n   ```sh\n   git init has-executable\n   touch has-executable/a has-executable/b\n   chmod +x has-executable/b\n   git -C has-executable add .\n   ```\n\n   It is not necessary to commit the changes, only to stage them, since the test program will check  out the index.\n\n4. *Optionally*, run `rm has-executable/[ab]` to remove the staged files from disk.\n\n5. Run the program by issuing `cargo run`. The program uses `gix-worktree-state` to check out the index. It should terminate successfully and not issue any errors.\n\n6. Run `ls -l has-executable` to inspect the permissions of the checked out files. Observe that owner, group, and other all have read, write, and execute permissions on `b`.\n\n   ```text\n   -rw-r--r-- 1 ek ek 0 Jan  9 03:38 a\n   -rwxrwxrwx 1 ek ek 0 Jan  9 03:38 b\n   ```\n\n   With affected versions of `gix-worktree-state`, the output shows `-rwxrwxrwx` for `b`, whether the files were removed in step 4 or not.\n\n7. It was not necessary to set `destination_is_initially_empty` to `false` explicitly to trigger the bug, because that is its default value. If desired, modify the program to pass `true` and rerun the experiment to verify that `b` is no longer created with excessive permissions. The modified program would change the last `checkout` argument from `Default::default(),` to:\n\n   ```rust\n           gix::worktree::state::checkout::Options {\n               destination_is_initially_empty: true,\n               ..Default::default()\n           },\n   ```\n\n### Impact\n\nSetting unlimited file permissions is a problem on systems where a user account exists on the system that should not have the ability to access and modify the files. That applies to multi-user systems, or when an account is used to run software with reduced abilities. (Some programs may also treat broad write permissions to mean less validation is required.)\n\nThis bug affects Unix-like systems but not Windows. The `gix clone` command is not believed to be affected, due to [`checkout_exclusive`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/af704f57bb9480c47cdd393465264d586f1d4562/gitoxide-core/src/index/checkout.rs#L14-L172)'s [use](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/af704f57bb9480c47cdd393465264d586f1d4562/gitoxide-core/src/index/checkout.rs#L61) of `destination_is_initially_empty: true`. Specialized uses in which repositories are known never to have any files marked executable are unaffected. Repositories that no untrusted users can access, due to not having the ability to traverse the directories to them or due to sufficiently restrictive ACLs, are likewise unaffected.\n\nThe default value of `destination_is_initially_empty` is `false`, so some applications may be affected even if they don't attempt checkouts in nonempty directories. The 0777 permissions are applied to files that are created earlier in the same checkout, as well as those that already existed, regardless of their prior permissions. On preexisting files, 0777 is set *even if [`overwrite_existing`](https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/blob/8d84818240d44e1f5fe78a231b5d9bffd0283918/gix-worktree-state/src/checkout/mod.rs#L54-L58) is `false`*, as that prevents the checkout from changing file contents but not permissions.\n\nFiles not tracked/staged as executable are not checked out with insecure permissions. Such a file that previously existed keeps its old permissions. However, this may include executable permissions that no longer match repository metadata, as well as undesired write permissions acquired from a previous vulnerable checkout. `set_mode(0o777)` clears other bits, so the bug is not exacerbated by the presence of setuid/setgid bits. In some applications, the vulnerable strategy may be used only for files rewritten by a [long running](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes/2.40.0#_long_running_filter_process) smudge filter or only in the presence of [delays](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes/2.40.0#_delay).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-worktree-state","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-worktree-state"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.17.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-fqmf-w4xh-33rh/GHSA-fqmf-w4xh-33rh.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-fqmf-w4xh-33rh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22620"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0001.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-281","CWE-687"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-01-21T21:13:06Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-01-20T16:15:28Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.660190Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h","published":"2024-08-22T16:41:28Z","modified":"2025-01-21T18:31:55Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-43785","RUSTSEC-2024-0364"],"summary":"gitoxide-core does not neutralize special characters for terminals","details":"### Summary\n\nThe `gix` and `ein` commands write pathnames and other metadata literally to terminals, even if they contain characters terminals treat specially, including ANSI escape sequences. This sometimes allows an untrusted repository to misrepresent its contents and to alter or concoct error messages.\n\n### Details\n\n`gitoxide-core`, which provides most underlying functionality of the `gix` and `ein` commands, does not neutralize newlines, backspaces, or control characters—including those that form ANSI escape sequences—that appear in a repository's paths, author and committer names, commit messages, or other metadata. Such text may be written as part of the output of a command, as well as appearing in error messages when an operation fails.\n\nANSI escape sequences are of particular concern because, when printed to a terminal, they can change colors, including to render subsequent text unreadable; reposition the cursor to write text in a different location, including where text has already been written; clear the terminal; set the terminal title-bar text to arbitrary values; render the terminal temporarily unusable; and other such operations.\n\nThe effect is mostly an annoyance. But the author of a malicious repository who can predict how information from the repository may be accessed can cause files in the repository to be concealed or otherwise misrepresented, as well as rewrite all or part of error messages, or mimic error messages convincingly by repositioning the cursor and writing colored text.\n\n### PoC\n\nOn a Unix-like system in a POSIX-compatible shell, run:\n\n```sh\ngit init misleading-path\ncd misleading-path\ntouch \"$(printf '\\033]0;Boo!\\007\\033[2K\\r\\033[91mError: Repository is corrupted. Run \\033[96mEVIL_COMMAND\\033[91m to attempt recovery.\\033[0m')\"\ngit add .\ngit commit -m 'Initial commit'\n```\n\nIn the repository—or, if desired, in a clone of it, to show that this is exploitable by getting a user to clone an untrusted repository—run this command, which outputs entries in a three-column form showing type, hash, and filename:\n\n```sh\ngix tree entries\n```\n\nAlthough the output is of that form, it does not appear to be. Instead, the output in a terminal looks like this, colorized to appear to be an error message, with `EVIL_COMMAND` in another color, and with no other text:\n\n```text\nError: Repository is corrupted. Run EVIL_COMMAND to attempt recovery.\n```\n\nIn some terminals, a beep or other sound will be made. In most terminals, the title bar text will be changed to `Boo!`, though in some shells this may be immediately undone when printing the prompt. These elements are included to showcase the abilities of ANSI escape sequences, but they are not usually themselves threats.\n\nTo see what is actually produced, `gix tree entries` can be piped to a command that displays special characters symbolically, such as `less` or `cat -v` if available.\n\n```text\nBLOB e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391 ESC]0;Boo!^GESC[2K^MESC[91mError: Repository is corrupted. Run ESC[96mEVIL_COMMANDESC[91m to attempt recovery.ESC[0m\n```\n\nThat shows the effect on `gix tree entries`, but various other commands are also affected, and the escape sequences and other special characters can also appear in non-path metadata, such as in the `user.name` used to create a commit.\n\n### Impact\n\nFor users who do not clone or operate in clones of untrusted repositories, there is no impact.\nWindows is much less affected than Unix-like systems due to limitations on what characters can appear in filenames, and because traditionally Windows terminals do not support as many ANSI escape sequences.\n\nBecause different `gix` and `ein` commands display different data in different formats, the author of a malicious repository must guess how it will be used, which complicates crafting truly convincing output, though it may be possible to craft a repository where `gix clone` fails to clone it but produces a misleading message.\n\nAlthough this is mainly exploitable on systems *other* than Windows, in the ability to produce misleading output this superficially resembles CVE-2024-35197. But this is much more limited, because:\n\n- The misleading output can only be made to go where the application is already sending output. Redirection is not defeated, and devices to access cannot be chosen by the attacker.\n- The misleading output can only be take place *when* the application is already producing output. This limitation complicates the production of believable messages.\n- Only terminals are affected. Even if a standard stream is redirected to another file or device, these special characters would not have a special effect, unless echoed later without sanitization.\n- Reading and blocking cannot be performed.\n- Applications other than the gitoxide `gix` and `ein` executables are unaffected. The exception is if another application uses `gitoxide-core`. But this is explicitly discouraged in the `gitoxide-core` documentation and is believed to be rare.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gitoxide-core","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gitoxide-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.45.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/08/GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h/GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gitoxide","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gitoxide"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.41.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/08/GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h/GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43785"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0364.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-150"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-08-22T16:41:28Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-08-22T15:15:16Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.650427Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0359","published":"2024-07-24T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-01-19T00:59:32.710269Z","aliases":["GHSA-cx7h-h87r-jpgr"],"summary":"The kstring integration in gix-attributes is unsound","details":"`gix-attributes` (in [`state::ValueRef`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/gix-attributes-v0.22.2/gix-attributes/src/state.rs#L19-L27)) unsafely creates a `&str` from a `&[u8]` containing non-UTF8 data, with the justification that so long as nothing reads the `&str` and relies on it being UTF-8 in the `&str`, there is no UB:\n\n```rust\n// SAFETY: our API makes accessing that value as `str` impossible, so illformed UTF8 is never exposed as such.\n```\n\nThe problem is that the non-UTF8 `str` **is** exposed to outside code: first to the `kstring` crate itself, which requires UTF-8 in its documentation and may have UB as a consequence of this, but also to `serde`, where it propagates to e.g. `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`, etc., where the same problems occur.\n\nThis is not sound, and it could cause further UB down the line in these places that can view the `&str`.\n\n*Thanks to [Devin Jeanpierre](https://github.com/ssbr) for discovering and reporting this issue.*","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-attributes","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-attributes"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.22.3"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":null,"informational":"unsound","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0359.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/gix-attributes"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0359.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide/issues/1460"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.717284Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-r56q-vv3c-6g9c","published":"2021-10-19T20:16:26Z","modified":"2025-01-14T08:57:35.856086Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-41150"],"related":["CVE-2021-41150"],"summary":"Improper sanitization of delegated role names","details":"### Impact\nThe tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize delegated role names when caching a repository, or when loading a repository from the filesystem.

different domain, Deno's`fetch()` redirect handling creates a follow-up redirect request that keeps the original `Authorization` header, leaking its content to that second domain.\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe [right behavior](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-cors-non-wildcard-request-header-name) would be to drop the `Authorization` header instead, in this scenario. The same is generally applied to `Cookie` and `Proxy-Authorization` headers, and is done for not only host changes, but also protocol/port changes. Generally referred to as \"origin\".\n\nThe [documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/web_platform_apis/#:~:text=Deno%20does%20not%20follow%20the,leaking%20authenticated%20data%20cross%20origin.) states: \n> Deno does not follow the same-origin policy, because the Deno user agent currently does not have the concept of origins, and it does not have a cookie jar. This means Deno **does not need** to protect against leaking authenticated data cross origin \n\n### Reproduction\n```ts\nconst ac = new AbortController()\n\nconst server1 = Deno.serve({ port: 3001, signal: ac.signal }, (req) => {\n  return new Response(null, {\n    status: 302,\n    headers: {\n      'location': 'http://localhost:3002/redirected'\n    },\n  })\n})\n\nconst server2 = Deno.serve({ port: 3002, signal: ac.signal }, (req) => {\n  const body = JSON.stringify({\n    url: req.url,\n    hasAuth: req.headers.has('authorization'),\n  })\n  return new Response(body, {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {'content-type': 'application/json'},\n  })\n})\n\nasync function main() {\n  const response = await fetch(\"http://localhost:3001/\", {\n    headers: {authorization: 'Bearer foo'}\n  })\n  const body = await response.json()\n  \n  ac.abort()\n  \n  if (body.hasAuth) {\n    console.error('ERROR: Authorization header should not be present after cross-origin redirect')\n  } else {\n    console.log('SUCCESS: Authorization header is not present after cross-origin redirect')\n  }\n}\n\nsetTimeout(main, 500)\n```\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno_fetch","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno_fetch"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.1"},{"fixed":"0.204.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-f27p-cmv8-xhm6/GHSA-f27p-cmv8-xhm6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.46.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-f27p-cmv8-xhm6/GHSA-f27p-cmv8-xhm6.json"}},{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.1.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-f27p-cmv8-xhm6/GHSA-f27p-cmv8-xhm6.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-f27p-cmv8-xhm6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21620"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-01-06T22:27:09Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-01-06T23:15:07Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.657801Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0432","published":"2024-12-18T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-01-03T18:42:21.256300Z","aliases":["GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w","RUSTSEC-2024-0433"],"related":["GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c"],"summary":"Malicious plugin names, recipients, or identities can cause arbitrary binary execution","details":"A plugin name containing a path separator may allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary\nbinary.\n\nSuch a plugin name can be provided to the `rage` CLI through an attacker-controlled\nrecipient or identity string, or an attacker-controlled plugin name via the `-j` flag.\n\nOn UNIX systems, a directory matching `age-plugin-*` needs to exist in the working\ndirectory for the attack to succeed.\n\nThe binary is executed with a single flag, either `--age-plugin=recipient-v1` or\n`--age-plugin=identity-v1`.

Since table definitions include the `PERMISSIONS` clause, this failure would result in permissions not being overwritten as a result, which may potentially lead users to believe they have changed the table permissions when they have not.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf a user attempted to update table permissions of a table defined with `TYPE RELATION` using `DEFINE TABLE ...

This may allow a client that is authorized to run queries in a SurrealDB server to access certain data in that specific table that they were not intended to be able to access after the specified change in permissions.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe `DEFINE TABLE` statement has been updated to appropriately overwrite data for tables defined with `TYPE RELATION`.\n\n- Version 2.1.4 and later are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers of tables with `TYPE RELATION` that may have been modified using the `OVERWRITE` clause in order to update permissions are advised to verify that the intended permissions are in place using the `INFO FOR DB` statement. Affected users who are unable to update and require updating permissions in a table with `TYPE RELATION` will be required to remove the table and define it from scratch with the intended permissions.

It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application.

This affects general message parsing and decryption with symmetric keys.\n\n### Impact\nAffected `rpgp` versions do not correctly set upper limits on the total reserved amount of memory when parsing long sequences of partial OpenPGP packets, which can grow to to several GiB in size. Additionally, up to 4GiB of memory is reserved for OpenPGP packets of fixed size with large length fields, even if less data is received. \nDepending on existing message size restrictions and available system resources, this can cause out-of-memory conditions and crash the `rpgp` process or cause other system instability through memory resource exhaustion when parsing crafted messages.\n\nAffected `rpgp` versions are susceptible to excessive memory allocation with values of up to 2TiB or long processing times for some decryption operations which involve the [Argon2 function](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9580.html#name-argon2). An attacker can provide a valid `Symmetric Key Encrypted Session Key` packet (SKESK) which uses `Argon2` for String-to-Key hashing with parameters that are excessive, but within specification limits of the RFC9580 OpenPGP standard. Since `rpgp` did not further restrict the Argon2 parameters, this can cause out-of-memory conditions and crash the `rpgp` process. Under some conditions,   the memory resource exhaustion may trigger other system instability. Alternatively, this can make the program unresponsive via long computations. The attacker needs to trick a victim into attempting decryption, but does not require knowledge of the symmetric secret used by the victim.\n\nThere is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.\n\n### Versions and Patches\n\nThe impact details on the message parsing component varies with different versions. We've confirmed some of the problematic behavior on older versions such as `v0.10.0` and see all recent versions as affected in some form.  \n\nThe affected `Argon2` functionality was introduced with `v0.12.0-alpha.1`, earlier versions are not vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerabilities have been fixed with version `0.14.2`.

Users of versions 0.73.0 of Cranelift should upgrade to either 0.73.1 or 0.74 to remediate this vulnerability.  Users of Cranelift prior to 0.73.0 should update to 0.73.1 or 0.74 if they were not using the old default backend.\n\n### Description\n\nThis bug was introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior to 0.73.0. The recently-released version 0.73.0 with default settings, and prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend, are vulnerable.  The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set of circumstances.  If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow access to memory addresses up to 2GiB before the start of the heap allocated for the WebAssembly module.\n\nIf the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size of the heap's bound.  \n\nThe impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap implementation; specifically:\n* if the heap has bounds checks, and\n* does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and \n* the heap bound is 2GiB or smaller \n\nthen this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another WebAssembly module heap.\n\nThe impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the WebAssembly module heap.\n\nThe bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack when the register allocator reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a 32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes those bits as the sign extension of the i32’s MSB.\n\nThe issue would thus occur when:\n* An i32 value is greater than or equal to 0x8000_0000;\n* The value is spilled and reloaded by the register allocator due to high register pressure in the program between the value’s definition and its use;\n* The value is produced by an instruction that we know to be \"special\" in that it zeroes the upper 32 bits of its destination: add, sub, mul, and, or;\n* The value is then zero-extended to 64 bits;\n* The resulting 64-bit value is used.\n\nUnder these circumstances there is a potential sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted for heap accesses zero-extends the WebAssembly heap address, adds it to a 64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-extend becomes a sign-extend, the module could reach backward and access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap.\n\nThis bug was identified by developers at Fastly following a report from Javier Cabrera Arteaga, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, with support from project Trustful of Stiftelsen för Strategisk Forskning.  In addition to supporting the analysis and remediation of this vulnerability, Fastly will publish a related Fastly Security Advisory at [https://www.fastly.com/security-advisories](https://www.fastly.com/security-advisories).\n\nIn addition to assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable.\n\n### General Impact to Lucet\n\nLucet inherits the heap address computation and bounds-checks of Cranelift, which it uses as its backend code generator. Of particular importance specifically is the address-space layout used by Lucet. In the default configuration for Lucet, only a single module is running, and therefore it is not possible to access memory from another module.\n\nBy default, the open source implementation of Lucet uses a maximum heap size of 4 GiB, and an instance slot size of 8 GiB, when invoking an instance from the lucet-wasi command-line tool. These settings are within the range of vulnerability described above, but only a single instance is running, so there is no other instance to read. When embedding the runtime (for example, in a long-running daemon), the default for the heap size as described in the source is 1MB; with this setting, the runtime is not vulnerable.\n\nLucet allocates its WebAssembly module instances into \"instance slots\", which are contiguous zones of virtual address space that contain the VM context at the bottom, the WebAssembly heap in the next page after that, a guard region in the middle, and other data at the top: the stack and the globals.\n\nIf the instance slot size is less than (max heap) + 2GiB, then the lowest accessible address using the bug will overlap with the prior instance’s heap. If the size of VM context + stack + globals is greater than (4GiB - heap limit), then the highest accessible address using the bug will overlap with this critical data. If neither of these conditions are true, the bug should only result in an access to the prior instance’s guard region.\n\nGenerally, if the limit is between 2GiB and 4GiB - ~1MB (depending on stack/global size) and the instance slot size is less than 6GiB, the configuration is vulnerable. If the limit is greater than 4GiB - ~1MB, the configuration is vulnerable regardless of instance slot size. Otherwise, the configuration is not vulnerable.\n\n### General Impact on Wasmtime\n\nIn Wasmtime, the same Cranelift heap address computations and heap types are used as above. The memory layout, however, is slightly different, with different outcomes:\n* With the mmap implementation impact is mitigated probabilistically if ASLR is enabled.\n* With the pooling allocator, the vulnerability only exists if a memory reservation size lower than the default of 6GB is used.\n\nWith the default mmap-based instance memory implementation, Wasmtime uses mmap() to allocate a block of memory large enough for the heap and guard region, as specified in its configuration. If the underlying OS implements ASLR (modern Linux, macOS and Windows do) then this address will be randomized, and the region below it will (probabilistically) be free. Hence, the bug is mitigated probabilistically in the default configuration if ASLR is enabled.\n\nIf using the pooling allocator, the vulnerability exists if instance memory size (`memory_reservation_size` in InstanceLimit) is strictly less than 6GiB (4 GiB + 2 GiB of guard pages).

An issue was discovered in the safe API of `Linker::func_*` APIs. These APIs were previously not sound when one `Engine` was used to create the `Linker` and then a different `Engine` was used to create a `Store` and then the `Linker` was used to instantiate a module into that `Store`. Cross-`Engine` usage of functions is not supported in Wasmtime and this can result in type confusion of function pointers, resulting in being able to safely call a function with the wrong type.\n\nTriggering this bug requires using at least two `Engine` values in an embedding and then additionally using two different values with a `Linker` (one at the creation time of the `Linker` and another when instantiating a module with the `Linker`).\n\nIt's expected that usage of more-than-one `Engine` in an embedding is relatively rare since an `Engine` is intended to be a globally shared resource, so the expectation is that the impact of this issue is relatively small.\n\nThe fix implemented is to change this behavior to `panic!()` in Rust instead of silently allowing it. Using different `Engine` instances with a `Linker` is a programmer bug that `wasmtime` catches at runtime.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.30.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade Wasmtime and are using more than one `Engine` in your embedding it's recommended to instead use only one `Engine` for the entire program if possible. An `Engine` is designed to be a globally shared resource that is suitable to have only one for the lifetime of an entire process. If using multiple `Engine`s is required then code should be audited to ensure that `Linker` is only used with one `Engine`.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to us on [the Bytecode Alliance Zulip chat](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217126-wasmtime)\n* Open an issue in [the `bytecodealliance/wasmtime` repository](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.30.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/09/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"wasmtime","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/wasmtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.30.0"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.11.0","0.12.0","0.15.0","0.15.1","0.16.0","0.16.1","0.17.0","0.18.0","0.18.1","0.18.2","0.19.0","0.20.0","0.21.0","0.22.0","0.23.0","0.24.0","0.25.0","0.26.0","0.27.0","0.28.0","0.28.1","0.29.0","0.9.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/09/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/security/advisories/GHSA-q879-9g95-56mx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39219"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/commit/b39f087414f27ae40c44449ed5d1154e03449bff"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/compare/0.29.0...0.30.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/wasmtime/PYSEC-2021-322.yaml"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WAVBRYDDUIY2ZR3K3FO4BVYJKIMJ5TP7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2Z33FTXFQ6EOINVEQIP4DFBG53G5XIY"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0110.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-843"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-09-17T20:07:13Z","nvd_published_at":"2021-09-17T20:15:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.674065Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-j8cm-g7r6-hfpq","published":"2024-07-17T18:30:55Z","modified":"2024-11-18T16:26:53Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-40640","RUSTSEC-2024-0354"],"related":["CVE-2024-40640"],"summary":"vodozemac's usage of non-constant time base64 decoder could lead to leakage of secret key material","details":"Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation for importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519 secret keys. This flaw might allow an attacker to infer some information about the secret key material through a side-channel attack.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe use of a non-constant time base64 implementation might allow an attacker to observe timing variations in the encoding and decoding operations of the secret key material. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying secret key material.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is considered low because exploiting the attacker is required to have access to high precision timing measurements, as well as repeated access to the base64 encoding or decoding processes.  Additionally, the estimated leakage amount is bounded and low according to the referenced paper.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch is in commit 734b6c6948d4b2bdee3dd8b4efa591d93a61d272.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\nA detailed description of the precise attack can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04600.

While `gix-path` first looks for `git` using a `PATH` search, in version 0.10.8 it also has a fallback strategy on Windows of checking two hard-coded paths intended to be the 64-bit and 32-bit Program Files directories:\n\nhttps://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/6cd8b4665bb7582f744c3244abaef812be39ec35/gix-path/src/env/git.rs#L9-L14\n\nExisting functions, as well as the newly introduced `exe_invocation` function, were updated to make use of these alternative locations. This causes facilities in `gix_path::env` to directly execute `git.exe` in those locations, as well as to return its path or whatever configuration it reports to callers who rely on it.\n\nAlthough unusual setups where the system drive is not `C:`, or even where Program Files directories have non-default names, are technically possible, the main problem arises on a 32-bit Windows system. Such a system has no `C:\\Program Files (x86)` directory.\n\nA limited user on a 32-bit Windows system can therefore create the `C:\\Program Files (x86)` directory and populate it with arbitrary contents. Once a payload has been placed at the second of the two hard-coded paths in this way, other user accounts including administrators will execute it if they run an application that uses `gix-path` and do not have `git` in a `PATH` directory.\n\n(While having `git` found in a `PATH` search prevents exploitation, merely having it installed in the default location under the real `C:\\Program Files` directory does not. This is because the first hard-coded path's `mingw64` component assumes a 64-bit installation.)\n\n### PoC\n\nOn a 32-bit (x86) Windows 10 system, with or without Git for Windows installed:\n\n1. Create a limited user account in `lusrmgr.msc` or the Settings application.\n2. Log in with that account and, using Windows Explorer or the `mkdir` command in PowerShell, create the directories `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\mingw32\\bin`. Although a limited user account cannot create regular files directly in `C:\\`, it can create directories including one called `Program Files (x86)`.\n3. Place a copy of `C:\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe` in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\mingw32\\bin` and rename it from `calc.exe` to `git.exe`. A different test payload may be used if preferred, and the executable need not already be signed or trusted.\n4. Log out, and log in as a different user. This user may be an administrator.\n5. If `gitoxide` is not installed, install it. If `cargo install gitoxide` is used for the installation, then the version of `gix-path` used in the installation can be observed.\n6. The vulnerability is only exploitable if `git` cannot be found in a `PATH` search. So, in PowerShell, run `gcm git` to check if `git` is present in the `PATH`. If so, temporarily remove it. One way to do this is for the current shell only, by running `$env:PATH` to inspect it and by assigning `$env:PATH = '...'` where `...` omits directories that contain `git`.\n7. Some commands that can be run outside a repository, and most commands that can be run inside a repository, will run the Calculator or other payload at least once per invocation. Try `gix clone foo` or, inside of a repository, `gix status`, `gix config`, `gix is-changed`, `gix fetch`, `ein t hours`, or `ein t query`. This is not exhaustive; most other `gix` and `ein` commands that access existing repository state or a network resource likewise run the payload.\n\n### Impact\n\nOnly Windows is affected. Exploitation is unlikely except on a 32-bit system. In particular, running a 32-bit build on a 64-bit system is not a risk factor. Furthermore, the attacker must have a user account on the system, though it may be a relatively unprivileged account. Such a user can perform privilege escalation and execute code as another user, though it may be difficult to do so reliably because the targeted user account must run an application or service that uses `gix-path` and must not have `git` in its `PATH`.\n\nThe main exploitable configuration is one where Git for Windows has been installed but not added to `PATH`. This is one of the options in its installer, though not the default option. Alternatively, an affected program that sanitizes its `PATH` to remove seemingly nonessential directories could allow exploitation. But for the most part, if the target user has configured a `PATH` in which the real `git.exe` can be found, then this cannot be exploited.\n\nThis vulnerability is comparable to [CVE-2022-24765](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2), in which an uncontrolled path like `C:\\.git\\config`, which a limited user can create, could supply configuration used by other users. However, in this case, exploitation is slightly simpler because, rather than using configuration, an executable is directly run.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-path","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-path"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.10.8"},{"fixed":"0.10.9"}]}],"versions":["0.10.8"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-mgvv-9p9g-3jv4/GHSA-mgvv-9p9g-3jv4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-mgvv-9p9g-3jv4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/6cd8b4665bb7582f744c3244abaef812be39ec35/gix-path/src/env/git.rs#L9-L14"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-427"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-07-18T15:26:04Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.670353Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-mjw4-jj88-v687","published":"2024-07-09T14:13:48Z","modified":"2024-11-18T16:26:50Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-39697","RUSTSEC-2024-0369"],"related":["CVE-2024-39697"],"summary":"panic

This behavior could be triggered in different scenarios:\n\n- When performing a `SELECT` operation on a table, the values that would be returned were iterated over, field permissions would be validated and any unauthorized value would be removed from the result returned. However, performing a `SELECT VALUE` operation (e.g. `SELECT VALUE private FROM data`) would result in a non-iterable value, which would not be removed from the returned result.\n\n- When aliasing a field (e.g. `SELECT private AS public FROM data`) for which the user did not have `SELECT` permissions within a `SELECT` query, permissions would be checked against the field of the resulting document containing the aliased field instead of the original document containing the original field. As a consequence, the original field value would be returned as the returned field would not match the original field where permissions had been defined.\n\n- When calling a function in the context of a `SELECT` query and passing a field with permissions as an argument to the function (e.g. `SELECT string::lowercase(private) FROM data`), the function would receive the field value before it had been removed from the document due to `SELECT` permissions. As a result, the function would have access to the value of the field regardless of field permissions. This case includes functions called from within events and other clauses that support function calling.\n\n- When executing a query containing a `WHERE` clause filtering records by a field that the querying user does not have access to `SELECT` (e.g. `SELECT public FROM data WHERE private ~ \"secret\"`), the response of that query would still take the value of the field into account. Even though the value of the protected field would not be returned, this behavior could be used as a side channel by the querying user to infer information about the value of the field.\n\n- When performing `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations over a table with a user that had those permissions but no `SELECT` permission, the `RETURN BEFORE` clause could be used (e.g. `DELETE data RETURN BEFORE`) to read the contents of the records prior to the authorized update or the deletion despite the querying user not being authorized to perform `SELECT` operations.\n\n- When performing `UPDATE` operations on a table for which the user had `SELECT` and `UPDATE` permissions, the `SET` clause could reference fields that the user had `UPDATE` but no `SELECT` permission for (e.g. `UPDATE data SET public = private`) in order to update the value of a field that the user had permission to `SELECT` to the value of another field for which the user did not.\n\n### Impact\n\nClients that were authorized by table permissions to execute `SELECT` statements for a table but were not authorized by field permissions to run `SELECT` queries for a specific field could still have been able to gain knowledge of the value of that field. Additionally, clients that were authorized to execute `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements for a table but not authorized to execute `SELECT` statements for the same table may have been able to gain knowledge of the contents of records in that table. This could only be exploited by users who were already authorized to execute queries on the database with the affected table or field.\n\nDue to its relationship with table and field permissions, which apply mainly to record users rather than system users, this issue mostly affects users relying on SurrealDB as a backend-as-a-service rather than SurrealDB as a traditional database backend.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe behavior when evaluating table or field permissions and filtering records or fields as a result of those evaluations has been improved to consider permissions before any changes to the document have been made and, when relevant, permissions after changes to the document have taken place. When a user is unauthorized to view record contents and field values by permissions, the returned documents will behave as if the record or field did not exist in order to prevent leaking any information.\n\n- Version 2.0.4 and later are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers affected by this issue and unable to update should not rely on the authorization provided by field permissions when it comes to the `SELECT` permission. Instead, read access to fields in affected versions should be restricted at the table level. When allowing the `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations for records via table permissions, users should not rely of the authorization provided by the `SELECT` permission. Instead, users should not allow clients to `UPDATE` or `DELETE` records that they should not be able to view.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/10/GHSA-9722-9j67-vjcr/GHSA-9722-9j67-vjcr.json"}},{"package":{"name":"surrealdb-core","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.0.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/10/GHSA-9722-9j67-vjcr/GHSA-9722-9j67-vjcr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-9722-9j67-vjcr"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/2161"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/3924"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4785"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4800"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4873"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/439ab99e15314ec5cf87047bf58246db646e3f8c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/c382fa158dc84b329328606f663efe574f102a7d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/e75e7736b3a028c4b6a4a4bdf00791d76f77e339"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/summary#permissions"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/statements/define/field#setting-permissions-on-fields"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/statements/define/table#defining-permissions"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-10-08T22:21:09Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.653475Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-qjrv-v6qp-x99x","published":"2024-10-08T22:20:02Z","modified":"2024-10-08T22:20:02Z","summary":"SurrealDB has an Uncaught Exception Handling Parsing Errors on Empty Strings","details":"The error rendering code from the parser would panic when handling failed parsing of queries where the error occurred when converting an empty string to a SurrealDB value.

Instead, to cover the occasional case that `git` outputs a quoted path, they attempt to parse the path by stripping the quotation marks:\n\nhttps://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/1cfe577d461293879e91538dbc4bbfe01722e1e8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L138-L142\n\nThe problem is that, when a path is quoted, it may change in substantial ways beyond the concatenation of quotation marks. If not reversed, these changes can result in another valid path that is not equivalent to the original.\n\nThis is not limited to paths with unusual characters such as quotation marks or newlines. Unless `git` is explicitly configured with `core.quotePath` set to `false`, it also happens when the path contains most non-ASCII characters, including accented or non-English letters. For example, `é` is transformed to `\\303\\251`, with literal backslashes. (This is an octal representation of the bytes in its UTF-8 encoding. This behavior is not limited to systems that encode paths with UTF-8 on disk.)\n\nRarely, the configuration file `gix-path` wrongly attempts to open can be created by an attacker who has a limited user account on the system. The attacker would often need to request an account username tailored to carrying out the attack.\n\n### PoC\n\n#### Quick demonstration on Unix\n\nOn a Unix-like system in which Git supports no higher scope than `system` for configuration variables (i.e., not on macOS with Apple Git), in a locale that supports UTF-8, with `gitoxide` installed, run:\n\n```sh\nmkdir myrepo\ncd myrepo\ngit init\nprintf '[real]\\n\\trealvar = realval\\n' > 'é'\nprintf '[fake]\\n\\tfakevar = fakeval\\n' > '\\303\\251'\nGIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM='é' gix config\n```\n\nIf the above conditions are satisfied and the `gix` command was built against an affected version of `gix-path`, then the last command's output looks something like this:\n\n```text\n# From '\\303\\251' (GitInstallation)\n[fake]\n        fakevar = fakeval\n\n# From 'é' (System)\n[real]\n        realvar = realval\n\n# From '/home/ubuntu/.gitconfig' (User)\n[init]\n        defaultBranch = main\n\n# From './.git/config' (Local)\n[core]\n        repositoryformatversion = 0\n        filemode = true\n        bare = false\n        logallrefupdates = true\n ```\n\n#### Demonstration across user accounts on Windows\n\nOn a test system running Windows on which Git for Windows is *not* installed system-wide—resembling a scenario in which users who wish to use Git are expected to install it themselves for their accounts—create two accounts, with these usernames:\n\n- *Renée*, the target of the attack. This user may be a limited user or an administrator. Its user profile directory is assumed to be `C:\\Users\\Renée`.\n- *Ren*, the user who carries out the attack. This user should be a limited user, since an administrator would not need to exploit this vulnerability to inject configuration. Its user profile directory is assumed to be `C:\\Users\\Ren`.\n\nAs *Ren*, run these commands in PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\n$d = \"$HOME\\303\\251e\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\etc\"\nmkdir $d\ngit config --file $d\\gitconfig core.sshCommand calc.exe\nicacls $HOME\\303 /grant 'Renée:(RX)' /T\n```\n\n(The `gitconfig` file can instead be written manually, in which case *Ren* need not have `git`.)\n\nAs *Renée*:\n\n1. Install Git for Windows in the default location for non-systemwide installations, which for that user account is inside `C:\\Users\\Renée\\AppData\\Local\\Programs`. For a non-administrative installation, Git for Windows will pick this location automatically. Allow the installer to place the directory containing `git` in the user's `PATH`, as it does by default.\n\n   (The scenario can be modified for any location the attacker can predict. So, for example, *Renée* can install Git for Windows with [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh/), and *Ren* could carry out the attack with correspondingly modified path components in place of `AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git`.)\n \n 2. Install `gitoxide` using any common technique, such as by [installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then running `cargo install gitoxide`.\n\n3. Open a PowerShell window and run a `gix` command that attempts to run the SSH client for transport. For example:\n\n    ```pwsh\n    gix clone ssh://localhost/myrepo.git\n    ```\n \n    At least one, and usually two, instances of the Windows calculator will pop up. This happens because `calc.exe` was configured in the fake configuration file the user *Ren* was able to cause to be used, by placing it at the location `gix-path` wrongly resolved the path of *Renée*'s own configuration file to.\n \n The `gitconfig` file written by the attacker can be adjusted with an arbitrary choice of payload, or to set other configuration variables.\n\n### Impact\n\nOn a single-user system, it is not possible to exploit this, unless `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` have been set to unusual values or Git has been installed in an unusual way. Such a scenario is not expected.\n\nExploitation is unlikely even on a multi-user system, though it is plausible in some uncommon configurations or use cases. It is especially unlikely with Apple Git on macOS, due to its very high scoped configuration in `/Library` or `/Applications` that would be detected instead, as in CVE-2024-45305.\n\nThe likelihood of exploitation may be higher on Windows, where attacks such as those shown in the Windows proof-of-concept above can be performed due to the status of `\\` as a directory separator, and where there is no restriction on usernames containing accented or non-English letters (though the latter is also permitted on some other systems). Even then, complex user interaction is required. In most cases, a system administrator would have to approve an innocuous-seeming username, and then the targeted user (who could be the same or a different user) would have to use an application that uses `gix-path`.\n\nIn general, exploitation is more likely to succeed if at least one of the following applies:\n\n- Users are expected to install `git` themselves, and are likely to do so in predictable locations.\n- Locations where `git` is installed, whether due to usernames in their paths or otherwise, contain characters that `git` quotes by default in paths, such as non-English letters and accented letters.\n- A custom `system`-scope configuration file is specified with the `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` environment variable, and its path is in an unusual location or has strangely named components.\n- A `system`-scope configuration file is absent, empty, or suppressed by means other than `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`. Currently, `gix-path` can treat a `global`-scope configuration file as belonging to the installation if no higher scope configuration file is available. This increases the likelihood of exploitation even on a system where `git` is installed system-wide in an ordinary way.\n\nHowever, exploitation is expected to be very difficult even under any combination of those factors.\n\nAlthough the effect here is similar to [CVE-2022-24765](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2) once exploited, a greater degree of user interaction would usually be required, and the attack complexity here is much higher because the necessary conditions are uncommon and challenging to predict.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-path","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-path"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.10.10","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45405"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/650a1b5cf25e086197cc55a68525a411e1c28031"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/1cfe577d461293879e91538dbc4bbfe01722e1e8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L138-L142"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0371.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-41"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-09-06T19:55:24Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-09-06T13:15:05Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.669771Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2023-0055","published":"2023-09-03T12:00:00Z","modified":"2024-09-16T14:15:37Z","aliases":["GHSA-c2hm-mjxv-89r4"],"related":["RUSTSEC-2023-0086"],"summary":"Multiple soundness issues","details":"`lexical` contains multiple soundness issues:\n\n 1.

This results in unbounded memory consumption and either a crash or out-of-memory (OOM) termination.\n\nThis issue can be triggered if you have at least one non-`@key` field that can be resolved by multiple subgraphs. To identify these shared fields, the schema for each subgraph must be reviewed. The mechanism to identify shared fields varies based on the version of Federation your subgraphs are using.\n\nYou can check if your subgraphs are using Federation 1 or Federation 2 by reviewing their schemas. Federation 2 subgraph schemas will contain a `@link` directive referencing the version of Federation being used while Federation 1 subgraphs will not. For example, in a Federation 2 subgraph, you will find a line like `@link(url: \"https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0\")`. If a similar `@link` directive is not present in your subgraph schema, it is using Federation 1. Note that a supergraph can contain a mix of Federation 1 and Federation 2 subgraphs.\n\n**To review Federation 1 subgraphs for impact:**\n\nIn Federation 1 subgraphs, fields are implicitly shareable across subgraphs. To review for impact, you will need to review for cases where multiple subgraphs can resolve the same field. For example: \n\n```graphql\n# Subgraph 1\ntype Query {\n  field: Int\n}\n\n# Subgraph 2\ntype Query {\n  field: Int\n}\n```\n\n\n**To review Federation 2 subgraphs for impact:**\n\nIn Federation 2 subgraphs, fields must be explicitly defined as shareable across subgraphs. This is done via the `@shareable` directive. For example:\n\n```graphql\n# Subgraph 1\n@link(url: \"https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0\")\ntype Query {\n  field: Int @shareable\n}\n\n# Subgraph 2\n@link(url: \"https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0\")\ntype Query {\n  field: Int @shareable\n}\n```\n\n### Impact Detail\n\nThis issue results from the Apollo query planner attempting to use a `Number` exceeding Javascript’s `Number.MAX_VALUE` in some cases. In Javascript, `Number.MAX_VALUE` is (2^1024 - 2^971).\n\nWhen the query planner receives an inbound graphql request, it breaks the query into pieces and for each piece, generates a list of potential execution steps to solve the piece. These candidates represent the steps that the query planner will take to satisfy the pieces of the larger query. As part of normal operations, the query planner requires and calculates the number of possible query plans for the total query. That is, it needs the product of the number of query plan candidates for each piece of the query. Under normal circumstances, after generating all query plan candidates and calculating the number of all permutations, the query planner moves on to stack rank candidates and prune less-than-optimal options. \n\nIn particularly complex queries, especially those where fields can be solved through multiple subgraphs, this can cause the number of all query plan permutations to balloon. In worst-case scenarios, this can end up being a number larger than `Number.MAX_VALUE`. In Javascript, if `Number.MAX_VALUE` is exceeded, Javascript represents the value as “infinity”. If the count of candidates is evaluated as infinity, the component of the query planner responsible for pruning less-than-optimal query plans does not actually prune candidates, causing the query planner to evaluate many orders of magnitude more query plan candidates than necessary.\n\nA given graph’s exposure to this issue varies based on its complexity. Consider the following Federation 2 subgraphs: \n\n```graphql\n# Subgraph 1\ntype Query {\n  field: Int @shareable\n}\n\n# Subgraph 2\ntype Query {\n  field: Int @shareable\n}\n```\n\nThe query planner can solve requests for `Query.field` in one of two ways - either by querying subgraph 1 or subgraph 2. \n\nThe following query with 1024 aliased fields would trigger this issue because 2^1024 > `Number.MAX_VALUE`:  \n\n```graphql\nquery {\n  field_1: field\n  field_2: field\n  # ...\n  field_1023: field\n  field_1024: field\n}\n```\n\n\nHowever, in a graph that provided 5 options to solve a given field, the bug could be encountered in a query that aliased the field approximately 440 times.\n\n\n### Patches\n@apollo/query-planner 2.8.5\n@apollo/gateway 2.8.5\nApollo Router 1.52.1\n\n### Workarounds\nThis issue can be avoided by ensuring there are no fields resolvable from multiple subgraphs. If all subgraphs are using Federation 2, you can confirm that you are not impacted by ensuring that none of your subgraph schemas use the `@shareable` directive. If you are using Federation 1 subgraphs, you will need to validate that there are no fields resolvable by multiple subgraphs. \n\nNote that a supergraph can contain a mix of Federation 1 and Federation 2 subgraphs. \n\nIf you do have fields resolvable by multiple subgraphs, changing this behavior in response to this issue may be risky to the operation of your supergraph. We recommend that you update to a patched version of either Apollo Router or Apollo Gateway.\n\nApollo customers with an enterprise entitlement using the Apollo Router can also mitigate much of the risk from this issue by implementing [Apollo’s Persisted Queries (PQ) feature](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/persisted-queries). With PQ enabled, the Apollo Router will only execute safelisted queries. While customers would need to ensure that queries that induce this issue are not added to the safelist, PQs would mitigate the risk of clients submitting ad hoc queries that exploit this issue.\n\n### References\n\n[Additional information on Query Plans](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/query-plans/)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apollo-router","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/apollo-router"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.52.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/08/GHSA-fmj9-77q8-g6c4/GHSA-fmj9-77q8-g6c4.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@apollo/query-planner","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40apollo/query-planner"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.8.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/08/GHSA-fmj9-77q8-g6c4/GHSA-fmj9-77q8-g6c4.json"}},{"package":{"name":"@apollo/gateway","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40apollo/gateway"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0"},{"fixed":"2.8.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/08/GHSA-fmj9-77q8-g6c4/GHSA-fmj9-77q8-g6c4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/federation/security/advisories/GHSA-fmj9-77q8-g6c4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43414"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/e309c9bb5a48c1304ff69c88b7eabdd08c26bf45"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/federation"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/query-plans"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/persisted-queries"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-673","CWE-674"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-08-27T18:14:12Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-08-27T18:15:15Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.659800Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-69fv-gw6g-8ccg","published":"2021-08-25T20:43:26Z","modified":"2024-09-12T20:52:04.541612Z","aliases":["CVE-2018-20998","RUSTSEC-2018-0011"],"summary":"Potential memory corruption in arrayfire","details":"The attribute repr() added to enums to be compatible with C-FFI caused memory corruption on MSVC toolchain.\n\narrayfire crates <= version 3.5.0 do not have this issue when used with Rust versions 1.27 or earlier.

This arbitrary object could potentially contain any SurrealDB value, including an object representing a subquery. For this to materialize, this object would need to be encoded using the bincode serialization format instead of the default JSON serialization format or the additionally supported CBOR serialization format.\n\nIf a binary object containing a subquery were to be provided in this way, that subquery would be computed while executing the `SIGNIN` and `SIGNUP` queries defined by the database owner while defining a record access method. Since those queries are executed under a system user session with the editor role, an unauthenticated attacker may be able to leverage this behavior to select, create, update and delete non-IAM resources with permissions of a system user with the editor role.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf a record access method was defined with a `SIGNIN` or a `SIGNUP` query and the SurrealDB RPC API was exposed to untrusted users, an attacker could be able to craft a binary object containing a subquery to provide in place of valid credentials when calling the `signin` and `signup` operations via the RPC API with the bincode serialization format. The attacker could use that subquery to select, create, update and delete resources in SurrealDB, but they would not be able to _directly_ view the results of the query. This method cannot be used to create, update or delete IAM resources, as access to those kind of resources requires the owner role.\n\n### Patches\n\nObjects provided as variables to the sign in and sign up methods are now recursively validated to ensure that they do not contain any non-computed values, which include subqueries and other data types that could potentially result in query execution.\n\n- Version 1.5.5 and later are not affected by this issue.\n- Version 2.0.0-beta.3 and later are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers unable to update may want to disallow access to the SurrealDB RPC API using the affected binary serialization formats by conservatively allowing only requests to the `/rpc` endpoint of the SurrealDB HTTP server with the `application/json` content type. If the RPC API is not used at all or only used by trusted clients, disallowing or restricting access to the `/rpc` endpoint of the SurrealDB HTTP server will also prevent exploitation. Alternatively, if filtering HTTP requests is not possible, record access methods that define `SIGNIN` and `SIGNUP` clauses may be temporarily removed to completely prevent potential attacks leveraging this issue.\n\n### References\n\n- [SurrealDB Documentation - Authentication (Record Users)](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#record-users)\n- [SurrealDB Documentation - RPC Protocol (Signup)](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signup)\n- [SurrealDB Documentation - RPC Protocol (Signin)](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signin)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr.json"}},{"package":{"name":"surrealdb-core","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr.json"}},{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0-beta.1"},{"fixed":"2.0.0-beta.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-64f8-pjgr-9wmr"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/b7583a653a2c495a60630dffd663f506426db330"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/eab7ef5354168d4039f7f7b77042c99a52f770a6"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signin"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc#signup"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#record-users"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-75"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-09-11T19:20:07Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.644326Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-6jmw-6mxw-w4jc","published":"2023-09-13T15:31:14Z","modified":"2024-09-11T18:45:42Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-39914","RUSTSEC-2023-0062"],"summary":"BER/CER/DER decoder panics on invalid input","details":"NLnet Labs’ bcder library up to and including version 0.7.2 panics while decoding certain invalid input data rather than rejecting the data with an error.

Internally, the state of the Future is tracked and stored in a struct called `CallFutureState`.  A bug in the polling implementation of the `CallFuture` allows multiple references to be held for this internal state and not all references were dropped before the `Future` is resolved. Since we have unaccounted references held, a copy of the internal state ended up being persisted in the canister's heap and thus causing a memory leak. \n\n### Impact\nCanisters built in Rust with `ic_cdk` and `ic_cdk_timers` are affected. If these canisters call a canister method, use timers or heartbeat, they will likely leak a small amount of memory on every such operation. **In the worst case, this could lead to heap memory exhaustion triggered by an attacker.**\n\nMotoko based canisters are not affected by the bug.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch has been backported to all minor versions between `>= 0.8.0, <= 0.15.0`. The patched versions available are `0.8.2, 0.9.3, 0.10.1, 0.11.6, 0.12.2, 0.13.5, 0.14.1, 0.15.1` and their previous versions have been yanked. \n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds at the moment. Developers are recommended to upgrade their canister as soon as possible to the latest available patched version of `ic_cdk` to avoid running out of Wasm heap memory. \n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Upgrading the canisters (without updating `ic_cdk`) also frees the leaked memory but it's only a temporary solution.\n\n### References\n- [dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/509](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/509)\n-

If these canisters call a canister method, use timers or heartbeat, they will likely leak a small amount of memory on every such operation. **In the worst case, this could lead to heap memory exhaustion triggered by an attacker.**\n\nMotoko based canisters are not affected by the bug.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch has been backported to all minor versions between `>= 0.8.0, <= 0.15.0`. The patched versions available are `0.8.2, 0.9.3, 0.10.1, 0.11.6, 0.12.2, 0.13.5, 0.14.1, 0.15.1` and their previous versions have been yanked. \n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds at the moment. Developers are recommended to upgrade their canister as soon as possible to the latest available patched version of `ic_cdk` to avoid running out of Wasm heap memory. \n\n> Upgrading the canisters (without updating `ic_cdk`) also frees the leaked memory but it's only a temporary solution.\n\n### Referencesas\n- [dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/509](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/509)\n- [ic_cdk docs](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/)\n- [Internet Computer Specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ic-cdk","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ic-cdk"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.8.0"},{"fixed":"0.8.2"},{"introduced":"0.9.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.9.3"},{"introduced":"0.10.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.10.1"},{"introduced":"0.11.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.11.6"},{"introduced":"0.12.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.12.2"},{"introduced":"0.13.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.13.5"},{"introduced":"0.14.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.14.1"},{"introduced":"0.15.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.15.1"},{"introduced":"0.16.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.16.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["denial-of-service"],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0372.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0372.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/pull/509"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.718096Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0371","published":"2024-09-06T12:00:00Z","modified":"2024-09-07T02:12:23.528387Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-45405","GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7"],"summary":"gix-path improperly resolves configuration path reported by Git","details":"### Summary\n\n`gix-path` runs `git` to find the path of a configuration file associated with the `git` installation, but improperly resolves paths containing unusual or non-ASCII characters, in rare cases enabling a local attacker to inject configuration leading to code execution.\n\n### Details\n\nIn `gix_path::env`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` to find the path of a file to treat as belonging to the `git` installation.\n\nAffected versions of `gix-path` do not pass `-z`/`--null` to cause `git` to report literal paths ([`650a1b5`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/650a1b5cf25e086197cc55a68525a411e1c28031)). Instead, to cover the occasional case that `git` outputs a quoted path, they attempt to parse the path by stripping the quotation marks:\n\n<https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/1cfe577d461293879e91538dbc4bbfe01722e1e8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L138-L142>\n\nThe problem is that, when a path is quoted, it may change in substantial ways beyond the concatenation of quotation marks. If not reversed, these changes can result in another valid path that is not equivalent to the original.\n\nThis is not limited to paths with unusual characters such as quotation marks or newlines. Unless `git` is explicitly configured with `core.quotePath` set to `false`, it also happens when the path contains most non-ASCII characters, including accented or non-English letters. For example, `é` is transformed to `\\303\\251`, with literal backslashes. (This is an octal representation of the bytes in its UTF-8 encoding. This behavior is not limited to systems that encode paths with UTF-8 on disk.)\n\nRarely, the configuration file `gix-path` wrongly attempts to open can be created by an attacker who has a limited user account on the system. The attacker would often need to request an account username tailored to carrying out the attack.\n\n### PoC\n\n#### Quick demonstration on Unix\n\nOn a Unix-like system in which Git supports no higher scope than `system` for configuration variables (i.e., not on macOS with Apple Git), in a locale that supports UTF-8, with `gitoxide` installed, run:\n\n```sh\nmkdir myrepo\ncd myrepo\ngit init\nprintf '[real]\\n\\trealvar = realval\\n' > 'é'\nprintf '[fake]\\n\\tfakevar = fakeval\\n' > '\\303\\251'\nGIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM='é' gix config\n```\n\nIf the above conditions are satisfied and the `gix` command was built against an affected version of `gix-path`, then the last command's output looks something like this:\n\n```text\n# From '\\303\\251' (GitInstallation)\n[fake]\n        fakevar = fakeval\n\n# From 'é' (System)\n[real]\n        realvar = realval\n\n# From '/home/ubuntu/.gitconfig' (User)\n[init]\n        defaultBranch = main\n\n# From './.git/config' (Local)\n[core]\n        repositoryformatversion = 0\n        filemode = true\n        bare = false\n        logallrefupdates = true\n```\n\n#### Demonstration across user accounts on Windows\n\nOn a test system running Windows on which Git for Windows is *not* installed system-wide—resembling a scenario in which users who wish to use Git are expected to install it themselves for their accounts—create two accounts, with these usernames:\n\n- *Renée*, the target of the attack. This user may be a limited user or an administrator. Its user profile directory is assumed to be `C:\\Users\\Renée`.\n- *Ren*, the user who carries out the attack. This user should be a limited user, since an administrator would not need to exploit this vulnerability to inject configuration. Its user profile directory is assumed to be `C:\\Users\\Ren`.\n\nAs *Ren*, run these commands in PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\n$d = \"$HOME\\303\\251e\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\etc\"\nmkdir $d\ngit config --file $d\\gitconfig core.sshCommand calc.exe\nicacls $HOME\\303 /grant 'Renée:(RX)' /T\n```\n\n(The `gitconfig` file can instead be written manually, in which case *Ren* need not have `git`.)\n\nAs *Renée*:\n\n1. Install Git for Windows in the default location for non-systemwide installations, which for that user account is inside `C:\\Users\\Renée\\AppData\\Local\\Programs`. For a non-administrative installation, Git for Windows will pick this location automatically. Allow the installer to place the directory containing `git` in the user's `PATH`, as it does by default.\n\n   (The scenario can be modified for any location the attacker can predict. So, for example, *Renée* can install Git for Windows with [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh/), and *Ren* could carry out the attack with correspondingly modified path components in place of `AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git`.)\n\n2. Install `gitoxide` using any common technique, such as by [installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then running `cargo install gitoxide`.\n\n3. Open a PowerShell window and run a `gix` command that attempts to run the SSH client for transport. For example:\n\n   ```pwsh\n   gix clone ssh://localhost/myrepo.git\n   ```\n\n   At least one, and usually two, instances of the Windows calculator will pop up. This happens because `calc.exe` was configured in the fake configuration file the user *Ren* was able to cause to be used, by placing it at the location `gix-path` wrongly resolved the path of *Renée*'s own configuration file to.\n\nThe `gitconfig` file written by the attacker can be adjusted with an arbitrary choice of payload, or to set other configuration variables.\n\n### Impact\n\nOn a single-user system, it is not possible to exploit this, unless `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` have been set to unusual values or Git has been installed in an unusual way. Such a scenario is not expected.\n\nExploitation is unlikely even on a multi-user system, though it is plausible in some uncommon configurations or use cases. It is especially unlikely with Apple Git on macOS, due to its very high scoped configuration in `/Library` or `/Applications` that would be detected instead, as in [CVE-2024-45305](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v26r-4c9c-h3j6).\n\nThe likelihood of exploitation may be higher on Windows, where attacks such as those shown in the Windows proof-of-concept above can be performed due to the status of `\\` as a directory separator, and where there is no restriction on usernames containing accented or non-English letters (though the latter is also permitted on some other systems). Even then, complex user interaction is required. In most cases, a system administrator would have to approve an innocuous-seeming username, and then the targeted user (who could be the same or a different user) would have to use an application that uses `gix-path`.\n\nIn general, exploitation is more likely to succeed if at least one of the following applies:\n\n- Users are expected to install `git` themselves, and are likely to do so in predictable locations.\n- Locations where `git` is installed, whether due to usernames in their paths or otherwise, contain characters that `git` quotes by default in paths, such as non-English letters and accented letters.\n- A custom `system`-scope configuration file is specified with the `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` environment variable, and its path is in an unusual location or has strangely named components.\n- A `system`-scope configuration file is absent, empty, or suppressed by means other than `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`. Currently, `gix-path` can treat a `global`-scope configuration file as belonging to the installation if no higher scope configuration file is available. This increases the likelihood of exploitation even on a system where `git` is installed system-wide in an ordinary way.\n\nHowever, exploitation is expected to be very difficult even under any combination of those factors.\n\nAlthough the effect here is similar to [CVE-2022-24765](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2) once exploited, a greater degree of user interaction would usually be required, and the attack complexity here is much higher because the necessary conditions are uncommon and challenging to predict.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-path","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-path"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.10.11"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":["gix_path::env::installation_config","gix_path::env::installation_config_prefix"],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["code-execution","privilege-escalation"],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0371.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/gix-path"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0371.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m8rp-vv92-46c7"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.718035Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0369","published":"2024-07-07T12:00:00Z","modified":"2024-09-05T13:57:23.822708Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-39697","GHSA-mjw4-jj88-v687"],"summary":"phonenumber:  panic on parsing crafted phonenumber inputs","details":"### Impact\n\nThe phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a reachable `assert!` guard on the phonenumber string.\n\nIn a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, where the \"number\" part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56.\n\nSince f69abee1/0.3.4/#52.\n\n0.2.x series is not affected.\n\n### Patches\nPatches have been published as version `0.3.6+8.13.36`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"phonenumber","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/phonenumber"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.3.3"},{"fixed":"0.3.6"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":["phonenumber::parse"],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["denial-of-service"],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0369.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/phonenumber"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0369.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/whisperfish/rust-phonenumber/security/advisories/GHSA-mjw4-jj88-v687"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-39697"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.717855Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-v26r-4c9c-h3j6","published":"2024-09-03T20:21:14Z","modified":"2024-09-04T17:18:40Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-45305","RUSTSEC-2024-0367"],"related":["CGA-h7j4-pv5f-96mh","CGA-jjm7-phrf-rhgm","CGA-r3g2-x65f-95w4"],"summary":"gix-path uses local config across repos when it is the highest scope","details":"### Summary\n\n`gix-path` executes `git` to find the path of a configuration file that belongs to the `git` installation itself, but mistakenly treats the local repository's configuration as system-wide if no higher scoped configuration is found. In rare cases, this causes a less trusted repository to be treated as more trusted, or leaks sensitive information from one repository to another, such as sending credentials to another repository's remote.\n\n### Details\n\nIn `gix_path::env`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` and parses the first line of the output to extract the path to the configuration file holding the configuration variable of highest [scope](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#SCOPES):\n\nhttps://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/12251eb052df30105538fa831e641eea557f13d8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L91\n\nhttps://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/12251eb052df30105538fa831e641eea557f13d8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L112\n\nWhile the configuration variable of highest scope is not usually in the local scope, there are practical situations where this occurs:\n\n- A configuration file truly associated with the installation is not present on all systems and can occasionally be empty. Likewise, there may be no variables in the global scope.\n- Configuration files associated with those higher scopes may be deliberately skipped by setting the `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` environment variables to `/dev/null` (or to `NUL` on Windows). This prevents `gix-path` from finding the path of configuration files for those scopes, while not preventing downstream components such as the function in `gix-config` from reporting a local path as being associated with the installation.\n- The `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` environment variable can be used to disable configuration associated with the installation. (`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` is more powerful than `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null` on systems where an additional \"unknown\" scope is associated with the installation, as occurs on macOS with Apple Git.) This will cause the local scope to be the highest nonempty scope under even more situations, though in practice it is less dangerous because most, though possibly not all, downstream components would disregard the value.\n\nA user may use either or both of the latter two techniques to turn off an undesired configuration or to create a more replicable environment. Such a user would expect that this results in a more controlled configuration.\n\nOften, when located inside one repository, a user performs operations on that repository or that are not specific to any repository. In such use, local configuration is typically desired or at least acceptable, and mistaking it as coming from another scope is not typically harmful.\n\nHowever, sometimes a user is in one repository and operates on another repository. A major case where this occurs is cloning one repository while located in another. This can be done in an ad-hoc fashion, including when cloning the repository outside of the one we are inside. It may also potentially be automated by an application for purposes such as submodule handling. Two kinds of problems are anticipated:\n\n- A less secure configuration may be set for a specific repository where it is judged acceptable, even though it would not be wanted for other repositories, such as to enable a protocol or set up debugging.\n- More likely, a configuration that supplies secrets for use in one repository's remote can be used to send those secrets to another repository's remote.\n\n### PoC\n\nIn this example, we send mock `Authorization: Basic ...` credentials meant for one repository's remote to another remote, by running `gix` while inside the first repository to clone the second repository.\n\nThese instructions are written for a Unix shell, but they will work in other shells, including in PowerShell on Windows if the method of setting environment variables is adapted and `/dev/null` is replaced with `NUL`. This procedure is likely to demonstrate the problem on all systems *except* macOS. This is due to the high-scoped \"unknown\" configuration that usually accompanies Apple Git, and reflects that gix-path is in practice much less vulnerable on macOS (though still potentially vulnerable).\n\n1. Install [`dummyhttp`](https://crates.io/crates/dummyhttp) to serve as a local HTTP server for the demonstration.\n\n2. Obtain a build of `gitoxide` with the `max` feature set enabled. While this vulnerability affects other builds, this example requires `max` for `http.extraHeader` support.\n\n   Running `cargo install gitoxide` will install such a build though it may build against a patched version of `gix-path`. Cloning the repository (12251eb052df30105538fa831e641eea557f13d8 and earlier are affected) and building with `cargo build` or `cargo install --path .` are also sufficient. In contrast, installing from published binaries with `binstall` or `quickinstall` does not provide the `max` feature, as of this writing.\n\n3. Run: `dummyhttp -i 127.0.0.1 -c 403 -v`\n\n4. In a separate terminal, create a new local repository and set up a mock remote and `http.extraHeader` configuration:\n\n   ```sh\n   git init myrepo\n   cd myrepo\n   git remote add origin http://127.0.0.1:8080/mygit.git\n   git config --local http.extraHeader 'Authorization: Basic abcde'\n   ```\n\n5. Make sure the testing setup is working by running `gix fetch` in the repository and checking that it fails in the expected way. In the terminal where that is run, a message should be shown indicating an HTTP 403 error. The more interesting output is in the terminal where `dummyhttp` is running, which should look like this:\n\n   ```text\n   2024-30-30 03:30:16 127.0.0.1:55689 GET /myrepo.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.1\n   ┌─Incoming request\n   │ GET /myrepo.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.1\n   │ Accept: */*\n   │ Authorization: Basic abcde\n   │ Git-Protocol: version=2\n   │ Host: 127.0.0.1:8080\n   │ User-Agent: git/oxide-0.42.2\n   ┌─Outgoing response\n   │ HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\n   │ Content-Length: 9\n   │ Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n   │ Date: Fri, 30 Aug 2024 03:30:16 -0400\n   ```\n\n   Some details may differ, especially dates and times. But `Authorization: Basic abcde` should be shown.\n\n6. Now, in the terminal where you ran `gix fetch`, try cloning a separate repository:\n\n   ```sh\n   gix clone http://127.0.0.1:8080/other.git\n   ```\n\n   Check the output appended in the terminal where `dummyhttp` is running. This is to observe that `Authorization: Basic abcde` was rightly *not* sent.\n\n   Alternatively, if it *does* appear, then your system may be in one of the uncommon configurations that is vulnerable without further action.\n\n7. Now rerun that command, but with a modified environment, to cause `gix-path` to wrongly treat configuration from the local scope as being associated with the `git` installation:\n\n   ```sh\n   env GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null gix clone http://127.0.0.1:8080/other.git\n   ```\n\n   Check the output appended in the terminal where `dummyhttp` is running. Observe that `Authorization: Basic abcde` was wrongly sent.\n\nWhile this procedure uses the same remote host for both repositories, this is not a required element. If the second repository had a different, untrusted host, the extra header would still be sent.\n\n### Impact\n\nIt is believed to be very difficult to exploit this vulnerability deliberately, due to the need either to anticipate a situation in which higher-scoped configuration variables would be absent, or to arrange for this to happen.

In rare cases, this causes a less trusted repository to be treated as more trusted, or leaks sensitive information from one repository to another, such as sending credentials to another repository's remote.\n\n### Details\n\nIn `gix_path::env`, the underlying implementation of the `installation_config` and `installation_config_prefix` functions calls `git config -l --show-origin` and parses the first line of the output to extract the path to the configuration file holding the configuration variable of highest [scope](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#SCOPES):\n\n<https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/12251eb052df30105538fa831e641eea557f13d8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L91>\n\n<https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/12251eb052df30105538fa831e641eea557f13d8/gix-path/src/env/git/mod.rs#L112>\n\nWhile the configuration variable of highest scope is not usually in the local scope, there are practical situations where this occurs:\n\n- A configuration file truly associated with the installation is not present on all systems and can occasionally be empty. Likewise, there may be no variables in the global scope.\n- Configuration files associated with those higher scopes may be deliberately skipped by setting the `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` environment variables to `/dev/null` (or to `NUL` on Windows). This prevents `gix-path` from finding the path of configuration files for those scopes, while not preventing downstream components such as the function in `gix-config` from reporting a local path as being associated with the installation.\n- The `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` environment variable can be used to disable configuration associated with the installation. (`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` is more powerful than `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null` on systems where an additional \"unknown\" scope is associated with the installation, as occurs on macOS with Apple Git.) This will cause the local scope to be the highest nonempty scope under even more situations, though in practice it is less dangerous because most, though possibly not all, downstream components would disregard the value.\n\nA user may use either or both of the latter two techniques to turn off an undesired configuration or to create a more replicable environment. Such a user would expect that this results in a more controlled configuration.\n\nOften, when located inside one repository, a user performs operations on that repository or that are not specific to any repository. In such use, local configuration is typically desired or at least acceptable, and mistaking it as coming from another scope is not typically harmful.\n\nHowever, sometimes a user is in one repository and operates on another repository. A major case where this occurs is cloning one repository while located in another. This can be done in an ad-hoc fashion, including when cloning the repository outside of the one we are inside. It may also potentially be automated by an application for purposes such as submodule handling. Two kinds of problems are anticipated:\n\n- A less secure configuration may be set for a specific repository where it is judged acceptable, even though it would not be wanted for other repositories, such as to enable a protocol or set up debugging.\n- More likely, a configuration that supplies secrets for use in one repository's remote can be used to send those secrets to another repository's remote.\n\n### PoC\n\nIn this example, we send mock `Authorization: Basic ...` credentials meant for one repository's remote to another remote, by running `gix` while inside the first repository to clone the second repository.\n\nThese instructions are written for a Unix shell, but they will work in other shells, including in PowerShell on Windows if the method of setting environment variables is adapted and `/dev/null` is replaced with `NUL`. This procedure is likely to demonstrate the problem on all systems *except* macOS. This is due to the high-scoped \"unknown\" configuration that usually accompanies Apple Git, and reflects that gix-path is in practice much less vulnerable on macOS (though still potentially vulnerable).\n\n1. Install [`dummyhttp`](https://crates.io/crates/dummyhttp) to serve as a local HTTP server for the demonstration.\n\n2. Obtain a build of `gitoxide` with the `max` feature set enabled. While this vulnerability affects other builds, this example requires `max` for `http.extraHeader` support.\n\n   Running `cargo install gitoxide` will install such a build though it may build against a patched version of `gix-path`. Cloning the repository ([`12251eb`](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/commit/12251eb052df30105538fa831e641eea557f13d8) and earlier are affected) and building with `cargo build` or `cargo install --path .` are also sufficient. In contrast, installing from published binaries with `binstall` or `quickinstall` does not provide the `max` feature, as of this writing.\n\n3. Run: `dummyhttp -i 127.0.0.1 -c 403 -v`\n\n4. In a separate terminal, create a new local repository and set up a mock remote and `http.extraHeader` configuration:\n\n   ```sh\n   git init myrepo\n   cd myrepo\n   git remote add origin http://127.0.0.1:8080/mygit.git\n   git config --local http.extraHeader 'Authorization: Basic abcde'\n   ```\n\n5. Make sure the testing setup is working by running `gix fetch` in the repository and checking that it fails in the expected way. In the terminal where that is run, a message should be shown indicating an HTTP 403 error. The more interesting output is in the terminal where `dummyhttp` is running, which should look like this:\n\n   ```text\n   2024-30-30 03:30:16 127.0.0.1:55689 GET /myrepo.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.1\n   ┌─Incoming request\n   │ GET /myrepo.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack HTTP/1.1\n   │ Accept: */*\n   │ Authorization: Basic abcde\n   │ Git-Protocol: version=2\n   │ Host: 127.0.0.1:8080\n   │ User-Agent: git/oxide-0.42.2\n   ┌─Outgoing response\n   │ HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\n   │ Content-Length: 9\n   │ Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n   │ Date: Fri, 30 Aug 2024 03:30:16 -0400\n   ```\n\n   Some details may differ, especially dates and times. But `Authorization: Basic abcde` should be shown.\n\n6. Now, in the terminal where you ran `gix fetch`, try cloning a separate repository:\n\n   ```sh\n   gix clone http://127.0.0.1:8080/other.git\n   ```\n\n   Check the output appended in the terminal where `dummyhttp` is running. This is to observe that `Authorization: Basic abcde` was rightly *not* sent.\n\n   Alternatively, if it *does* appear, then your system may be in one of the uncommon configurations that is vulnerable without further action.\n\n7. Now rerun that command, but with a modified environment, to cause `gix-path` to wrongly treat configuration from the local scope as being associated with the `git` installation:\n\n   ```sh\n   env GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null gix clone http://127.0.0.1:8080/other.git\n   ```\n\n   Check the output appended in the terminal where `dummyhttp` is running. Observe that `Authorization: Basic abcde` was wrongly sent.\n\nWhile this procedure uses the same remote host for both repositories, this is not a required element. If the second repository had a different, untrusted host, the extra header would still be sent.\n\n### Impact\n\nIt is believed to be very difficult to exploit this vulnerability deliberately, due to the need either to anticipate a situation in which higher-scoped configuration variables would be absent, or to arrange for this to happen. Although any operating system may be affected, users running Apple Git on macOS are much less likely to be affected.\n\nIn the example shown above, more secure general practices would avoid it: using a credential manager, or even using `http.<url>.extraHeader` with as specific a `<url>` as possible, rather than the more general `http.extraHeader`.

External Coprocessing with specific configurations; or\n2. Native Rust Plugins accessing the Router request body in the RouterService layer \n\nRouter customizations using Rhai scripts are **not** impacted.\n\n### When using External Coprocessing:\n\nInstances of the Apollo Router running versions >=1.21.0 and <1.52.1 are impacted by a denial-of-service vulnerability if **all** of the following are true:\n\n1. Router has been configured to support External Coprocessing.\n2. Router has been configured to send request bodies to coprocessors. This is a non-default configuration and must be configured intentionally by administrators.\n\nYou can identify if you are impacted by reviewing your router's configuration YAML for the following config:\n\n```yaml\n...\ncoprocessor:\n  url: http://localhost:9000 # likely different in your environment\n  router:\n    request:\n      body: true # this must be set to 'true' to be impacted\n...\n```\nExternal Coprocessing was initially made available as an experimental feature with [Router version 1.21.0](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.21.0) on 2023-06-20 and was made generally available with [Router version 1.38.0](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.38.0) on 2024-01-19. More information about the Router’s [External Coprocessing feature is available here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/coprocessor).\n\n### When using Native Rust Plugins:\n\nInstances of the Apollo Router running versions >=1.7.0 and <1.52.1 are impacted by a denial-of-service vulnerability if **all** of the following are true:\n\n1. Router has been configured to use a custom-developed Native Rust Plugin\n2. The plugin accesses `Request.router_request` in the `RouterService` layer\n3. You are accumulating the body from `Request.router_request` into memory\n\nTo use a plugin, you need to be running a customized Router binary. Additionally, you need to have a `plugins` section with at least one plugin defined in your Router’s configuration YAML. That plugin would also need to define a custom `router_service` method.\n\nYou can check for a defined plugin by reviewing for the following in your Router’s configuration YAML:\n\n```yaml\n...\nplugins:\n    custom_plugin_name:\n        # custom config here\n...\n```\n\nYou can check for a custom `router_service` method in a plugin, by reviewing for the following function signature in your plugin’s source:\n\n```rust\nfn router_service(&self, service: router::BoxService) -> router::BoxService\n```\n\nMore information about the Router’s [Native Rust Plugin feature is available here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/native).\n\n## Impact Detail\n\nIf using an impacted configuration, the Router will load entire HTTP request bodies into memory without respect to other HTTP request size-limiting configurations like `limits.http_max_request_bytes`. This can cause the Router to be out-of-memory (OOM) terminated if a sufficiently large request is sent to the Router.\n\nBy default, the Router sets `limits.http_max_request_bytes` to 2 MB. More information about the Router’s [request limiting features is available here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview/#request-limits).\n\n## Patches\n\n[Apollo Router 1.52.1](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.52.1)\n\nIf you have an impacted configuration as defined above, please upgrade to at least Apollo Router 1.52.1.\n\n## Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade, you can mitigate the denial-of-service opportunity impacting External Coprocessors by setting the `coprocessor.router.request.body` configuration option to `false`. Please note that changing this configuration option will change the information sent to any coprocessors you have configured and may impact functionality implemented by those coprocessors. \n\nIf you have developed a Native Rust Plugin and cannot upgrade, you can update your plugin to either not accumulate the request body or enforce a maximum body size limit. \n\nYou can also mitigate this issue by limiting HTTP body payload sizes prior to the Router (e.g., in a proxy or web application firewall appliance).\n\n## References\n[Apollo Router 1.52.1 Release Notes](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.52.1)\n[External Coprocessing documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/coprocessor)\n[HTTP Request Limiting documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview/#request-limits)\n[Native Rust Plugin documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/native)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apollo-router","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/apollo-router"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.7.0"},{"fixed":"1.52.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/08/GHSA-x6xq-whh3-gg32/GHSA-x6xq-whh3-gg32.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-x6xq-whh3-gg32"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43783"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/7a9c020608a62dcaa306b72ed0f6980f15923b14"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.52.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/overview/#request-limits"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/coprocessor"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/customizations/native"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-08-27T18:14:29Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-08-27T18:15:15Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.685545Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm","published":"2023-10-18T18:27:47Z","modified":"2024-08-27T14:22:19Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-43806"],"related":["CGA-6qg7-2wh6-26w3","CGA-hv6w-7882-f89g","CGA-r8fm-xrjw-4qhq","CGA-x4w6-x2c3-9pgc"],"summary":"rustix's `rustix::fs::Dir` iterator with the `linux_raw` backend can cause memory explosion","details":"### Summary\n\nWhen using `rustix::fs::Dir` using the `linux_raw` backend, it's possible for the iterator to \"get stuck\" when an IO error is encountered. Combined with a memory over-allocation issue in `rustix::fs::Dir::read_more`, this can cause quick and unbounded memory explosion (gigabytes in a few seconds if used on a hot path) and eventually lead to an OOM crash of the application.\n\n### Details\n\n#### Discovery\n\nThe symptoms were initially discovered in https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/issues/284. That post has lots of details of our investigation. See [this post](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/issues/284#issuecomment-1754321993) and the [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/273534239310479360/1161137828395237556) for details.\n\n#### Diagnosis\n\nThis issue is caused by the combination of two independent bugs:\n\n1. Stuck iterator\n- The `rustix::fs::Dir` iterator can fail to halt after encountering an IO error, causing the caller to be stuck in an infinite loop.\n2. Memory over-allocation\n- `Dir::read_more` incorrectly grows the read buffer unconditionally each time it is called, regardless of necessity.\n\nSince `<Dir as Iterator>::next` calls `Dir::read`, which in turn calls `Dir::read_more`, this means an IO error encountered during reading a directory can lead to rapid and unbounded growth of memory use.\n\n### PoC\n\n```rust\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    // create a directory, get a FD to it, then unlink the directory but keep the FD\n    std::fs::create_dir(\"tmp_dir\")?;\n    let dir_fd = rustix::fs::openat(\n        rustix::fs::CWD,\n        rustix::cstr!(\"tmp_dir\"),\n        rustix::fs::OFlags::RDONLY | rustix::fs::OFlags::CLOEXEC,\n        rustix::fs::Mode::empty(),\n    )?;\n    std::fs::remove_dir(\"tmp_dir\")?;\n\n    // iterator gets stuck in infinite loop and memory explodes\n    rustix::fs::Dir::read_from(dir_fd)?\n        // the iterator keeps returning `Some(Err(_))`, but never halts by returning `None`\n        // therefore if the implementation ignores the error (or otherwise continues\n        // after seeing the error instead of breaking), the loop will not halt\n        .filter_map(|dirent_maybe_error| dirent_maybe_error.ok())\n        .for_each(|dirent| {\n            // your happy path\n            println!(\"{dirent:?}\");\n        });\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nIf a program tries to access a directory with its file descriptor after the file has been unlinked (or any other action that leaves the `Dir` iterator in the stuck state), and the implementation does not break after seeing an error, it can cause a memory explosion.\n\nAs an example, Linux's various virtual file systems (e.g. `/proc`, `/sys`) can contain directories that spontaneously pop in and out of existence. Attempting to iterate over them using `rustix::fs::Dir` directly or indirectly (e.g. with the `procfs` crate) can trigger this fault condition if the implementation decides to continue on errors.\n\nAn attacker knowledgeable about the implementation details of a vulnerable target can therefore try to trigger this fault condition via any one or a combination of several available APIs. If successful, the application host will quickly run out of memory, after which the application will likely be terminated by an OOM killer, leading to denial of service.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rustix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/rustix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.35.11"},{"fixed":"0.35.15"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/10/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rustix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/rustix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.36.0"},{"fixed":"0.36.16"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/10/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rustix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/rustix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.37.0"},{"fixed":"0.37.25"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/10/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm.json"}},{"package":{"name":"rustix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/rustix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.38.0"},{"fixed":"0.38.19"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/10/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/security/advisories/GHSA-c827-hfw6-qwvm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43806"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/issues/284"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich/issues/284#issuecomment-1754321993"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/commit/31fd98ca723b93cc6101a3e29843ea5cf094e159"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/commit/87481a97f4364d12d5d6f30cdd025a0fc509b8ec"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/commit/df3c3a192cf144af0da8a57417fb4addbdc611f6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/commit/eecece4a84fc58eafdc809cc2cedd374dee876a5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://discord.com/channels/273534239310479360/1161137828395237556"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-10-18T18:27:47Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-08-26T19:15:08Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.656132Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0364","published":"2024-08-22T12:00:00Z","modified":"2024-08-22T23:42:28.852335Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-43785","GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h"],"summary":"gitoxide-core does not neutralize special characters for terminals","details":"### Summary\n\nThe `gix` and `ein` commands write pathnames and other metadata literally to terminals, even if they contain characters terminals treat specially, including ANSI escape sequences. This sometimes allows an untrusted repository to misrepresent its contents and to alter or concoct error messages.\n\n### Details\n\n`gitoxide-core`, which provides most underlying functionality of the `gix` and `ein` commands, does not neutralize newlines, backspaces, or control characters—including those that form ANSI escape sequences—that appear in a repository's paths, author and committer names, commit messages, or other metadata. Such text may be written as part of the output of a command, as well as appearing in error messages when an operation fails.\n\nANSI escape sequences are of particular concern because, when printed to a terminal, they can change colors, including to render subsequent text unreadable; reposition the cursor to write text in a different location, including where text has already been written; clear the terminal; set the terminal title-bar text to arbitrary values; render the terminal temporarily unusable; and other such operations.\n\nThe effect is mostly an annoyance. But the author of a malicious repository who can predict how information from the repository may be accessed can cause files in the repository to be concealed or otherwise misrepresented, as well as rewrite all or part of error messages, or mimic error messages convincingly by repositioning the cursor and writing colored text.\n\n### PoC\n\nOn a Unix-like system in a POSIX-compatible shell, run:\n\n```sh\ngit init misleading-path\ncd misleading-path\ntouch \"$(printf '\\033]0;Boo!\\007\\033[2K\\r\\033[91mError: Repository is corrupted. Run \\033[96mEVIL_COMMAND\\033[91m to attempt recovery.\\033[0m')\"\ngit add .\ngit commit -m 'Initial commit'\n```\n\nIn the repository—or, if desired, in a clone of it, to show that this is exploitable by getting a user to clone an untrusted repository—run this command, which outputs entries in a three-column form showing type, hash, and filename:\n\n```sh\ngix tree entries\n```\n\nAlthough the output is of that form, it does not appear to be. Instead, the output in a terminal looks like this, colorized to appear to be an error message, with `EVIL_COMMAND` in another color, and with no other text:\n\n```text\nError: Repository is corrupted. Run EVIL_COMMAND to attempt recovery.\n```\n\nIn some terminals, a beep or other sound will be made. In most terminals, the title bar text will be changed to `Boo!`, though in some shells this may be immediately undone when printing the prompt. These elements are included to showcase the abilities of ANSI escape sequences, but they are not usually themselves threats.\n\nTo see what is actually produced, `gix tree entries` can be piped to a command that displays special characters symbolically, such as `less` or `cat -v` if available.\n\n```text\nBLOB e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391 ESC]0;Boo!^GESC[2K^MESC[91mError: Repository is corrupted. Run ESC[96mEVIL_COMMANDESC[91m to attempt recovery.ESC[0m\n```\n\nThat shows the effect on `gix tree entries`, but various other commands are also affected, and the escape sequences and other special characters can also appear in non-path metadata, such as in the `user.name` used to create a commit.\n\n### Impact\n\nFor users who do not clone or operate in clones of untrusted repositories, there is no impact.\n\nWindows is much less affected than Unix-like systems due to limitations on what characters can appear in filenames, and because traditionally Windows terminals do not support as many ANSI escape sequences.\n\nBecause different `gix` and `ein` commands display different data in different formats, the author of a malicious repository must guess how it will be used, which complicates crafting truly convincing output, though it may be possible to craft a repository where `gix clone` fails to clone it but produces a misleading message.\n\nAlthough this is mainly exploitable on systems *other* than Windows, in the ability to produce misleading output this superficially resembles [CVE-2024-35197](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9). But this is much more limited, because:\n\n- The misleading output can only be made to go where the application is already sending output. Redirection is not defeated, and devices to access cannot be chosen by the attacker.\n- The misleading output can only be take place *when* the application is already producing output. This limitation complicates the production of believable messages.\n- Only terminals are affected. Even if a standard stream is redirected to another file or device, these special characters would not have a special effect, unless echoed later without sanitization.\n- Reading and blocking cannot be performed.\n- Applications other than the gitoxide `gix` and `ein` executables are unaffected. The exception is if another application uses `gitoxide-core`. But this is explicitly discouraged in the `gitoxide-core` documentation and is believed to be rare.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gitoxide-core","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gitoxide-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0364.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/gitoxide-core"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0364.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-88g2-r9rw-g55h"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43785"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/issues/1534"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.717565Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-vgvv-x7xg-6cqg","published":"2024-08-14T21:18:20Z","modified":"2024-08-21T18:59:23Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-43410"],"summary":"Russh

While `gix-path` first looks for `git` using a `PATH` search, in version 0.10.8 it also has a fallback strategy on Windows of checking [two hard-coded paths](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/blob/6cd8b4665bb7582f744c3244abaef812be39ec35/gix-path/src/env/git.rs#L9-L14) intended to be the 64-bit and 32-bit Program Files directories:\n\n```rust\n/// Other places to find Git in.\n#[cfg(windows)]\npub(super) static ALTERNATIVE_LOCATIONS: &[&str] = &[\n    \"C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/bin\",\n    \"C:/Program Files (x86)/Git/mingw32/bin\",\n];\n```\n\nExisting functions, as well as the newly introduced `exe_invocation` function, were updated to make use of these alternative locations. This causes facilities in `gix_path::env` to directly execute `git.exe` in those locations, as well as to return its path or whatever configuration it reports to callers who rely on it.\n\nAlthough unusual setups where the system drive is not `C:`, or even where Program Files directories have non-default names, are technically possible, the main problem arises on a 32-bit Windows system. Such a system has no `C:\\Program Files (x86)` directory.\n\nA limited user on a 32-bit Windows system can therefore create the `C:\\Program Files (x86)` directory and populate it with arbitrary contents. Once a payload has been placed at the second of the two hard-coded paths in this way, other user accounts including administrators will execute it if they run an application that uses `gix-path` and do not have `git` in a `PATH` directory.\n\n(While having `git` found in a `PATH` search prevents exploitation, merely having it installed in the default location under the real `C:\\Program Files` directory does not. This is because the first hard-coded path's `mingw64` component assumes a 64-bit installation.)\n\n### PoC\n\nOn a 32-bit (x86) Windows 10 system, with or without Git for Windows installed:\n\n1. Create a limited user account in `lusrmgr.msc` or the Settings application.\n2. Log in with that account and, using Windows Explorer or the `mkdir` command in PowerShell, create the directories `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\mingw32\\bin`. Although a limited user account cannot create regular files directly in `C:\\`, it can create directories including one called `Program Files (x86)`.\n3. Place a copy of `C:\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe` in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\mingw32\\bin` and rename it from `calc.exe` to `git.exe`. A different test payload may be used if preferred, and the executable need not already be signed or trusted.\n4. Log out, and log in as a different user. This user may be an administrator.\n5. If `gitoxide` is not installed, install it. If `cargo install gitoxide` is used for the installation, then the version of `gix-path` used in the installation can be observed.\n6. The vulnerability is only exploitable if `git` cannot be found in a `PATH` search. So, in PowerShell, run `gcm git` to check if `git` is present in the `PATH`. If so, temporarily remove it. One way to do this is for the current shell only, by running `$env:PATH` to inspect it and by assigning `$env:PATH = '...'` where `...` omits directories that contain `git`.\n7. Some commands that can be run outside a repository, and most commands that can be run inside a repository, will run the Calculator or other payload at least once per invocation. Try `gix clone foo` or, inside of a repository, `gix status`, `gix config`, `gix is-changed`, `gix fetch`, `ein t hours`, or `ein t query`. This is not exhaustive; most other `gix` and `ein` commands that access existing repository state or a network resource likewise run the payload.\n\n### Impact\n\nOnly Windows is affected. Exploitation is unlikely except on a 32-bit system. In particular, running a 32-bit build on a 64-bit system is not a risk factor. Furthermore, the attacker must have a user account on the system, though it may be a relatively unprivileged account. Such a user can perform privilege escalation and execute code as another user, though it may be difficult to do so reliably because the targeted user account must run an application or service that uses `gix-path` and must not have `git` in its `PATH`.\n\nThe main exploitable configuration is one where Git for Windows has been installed but not added to `PATH`. This is one of the options in its installer, though not the default option. Alternatively, an affected program that sanitizes its `PATH` to remove seemingly nonessential directories could allow exploitation. But for the most part, if the target user has configured a `PATH` in which the real `git.exe` can be found, then this cannot be exploited.\n\nThis vulnerability is comparable to [CVE-2022-24765](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2), in which an uncontrolled path like `C:\\.git\\config`, which a limited user can create, could supply configuration used by other users. However, in this case, exploitation is slightly simpler because, rather than using configuration, an executable is directly run.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-path","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-path"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.10.8"},{"fixed":"0.10.9"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":["gix_path::env::exe_invocation","gix_path::env::installation_config","gix_path::env::installation_config_prefix","gix_path::env::system_prefix"],"os":["windows"]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["code-execution","privilege-escalation"],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0355.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/gix-path"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0355.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-mgvv-9p9g-3jv4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mgvv-9p9g-3jv4"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.717082Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0354","published":"2024-07-17T12:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-18T11:41:43.252813Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-40640","GHSA-j8cm-g7r6-hfpq"],"summary":" Usage of non-constant time base64 decoder could lead to leakage of secret key material","details":"Versions before 0.7.0 of vodozemac use a non-constant time base64 implementation\nfor importing key material for Megolm group sessions and `PkDecryption` Ed25519\nsecret keys.

This allows a repository, when cloned, to cause indefinite blocking or the production of arbitrary message that appear to have come from the application, and potentially other harmful effects under limited circumstances.\n\n### Details\n\nIt is possible to create a Git repository that contains references or filenames that Windows treats as legacy DOS-style aliases for system devices. When such a repository is cloned:\n\n- In references, `gix-ref` does not include a check for such names before attempting to access them on disk, which reads from the devices, though the ability to exfiltrate data appears limited.\n- In paths, `gix-worktree-state` does not treat such names as collisions and instead writes to them, which writes arbitrary attacker-controlled data to the devices.\n\nSome such device names refer to devices that are often absent or inaccessible. But a few are guaranteed to be available, allowing some attacks to be carried out with low complexity. For both reading refs and writing paths, one important case is the console:\n\n- Reading a ref whose last component (e.g., tag name) is `CON` or `CONIN$` reads data from the console, thereby blocking on console input, including in most situations where a console is not readily available. This may facilitate denial of service attacks.\n- Checking out a file named `CON` or `CONOUT$` writes its contents to the console. This allows an untrusted repository to produce arbitrary text that appears to be a message from the application. Such text may facilitate social engineering if it is selected to instruct the user to perform a particular action.\n\nAnother potentially important case is serial ports. For example, `COM1` refers to the first serial port, if present. A malicious repository may be able to disrupt intended use of serial ports or attempt to interact with a device. In some configurations, it may be possible to interfere with the operation of a physical or virtual serial console. On Windows, local access to serial ports is often permitted even for limited user accounts without elevation.\n\n[Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions) covers most reserved names. `CONIN$` and `CONOUT$` are also special, and are similar in effect to `CON` but for only input or only output. These names are case-insensitive and can also be accessed with file extensions (e.g, `CON.txt` is equivalent to `CON`) and with some variations involving added spaces or colons.\n\n### PoC\n\n#### Ref example\n\nCreate a repository on a non-Windows system (or in WSL) with at least one commit. Use `git tag CON` to create a lightweight tag named `CON`. Place the repository somewhere it can be cloned on Windows. A `file://` URL is sufficient for testing if a private remote is unavailable. If using `git push`, pass `--tags` so the remote has the tag.\n\nOn a Windows system, clone the repository with `gix clone`. This command will block immediately, reading input from the console. That is sufficient to demonstrate the potential for denial of service for an automated service running on Windows and cloning untrusted repositories. The experiment can be stopped with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.\n\nHowever, if desired, input can be provided. Ending input with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> will cause it to be passed to the application. This will lead to an error message, the specific details of which vary by whether the input is empty or nonempty, and whether it matches or does not match the hexadecimal hash of the tagged commit.\n\n#### Path example\n\nCreate a repository on a non-Windows system (or in WSL) and commit a file named `CON` with the contents:\n\n```text\nwarning: data loss imminent; you should run EVIL_COMMAND to back up your work!\n```\n\nWhile that example text serves to illustrate the risk, any distinctive text is sufficient to observe the vulnerability. Place the repository somewhere it can be cloned on Windows. As above, a `file://` URL is sufficient.\n\nOn a Windows system, clone the repository with `gix clone`. The output usually looks like this, with the deceptive message appearing to come from `gix`:\n\n```text\nwarning: data loss imminent; you should run EVIL_COMMAND to back up your work!\n 04:45:15 indexing done 3.0 objects in 0.00s (12.1K objects/s)\n 04:45:15 decompressing done 309B in 0.00s (1.2MB/s)\n 04:45:15     Resolving done 3.0 objects in 0.05s (58.0 objects/s)\n 04:45:15      Decoding done 309B in 0.05s (6.0KB/s)\n 04:45:15 writing index file done 1.2KB in 0.00s (7.0MB/s)\n 04:45:15  create index file done 3.0 objects in 0.05s (55.0 objects/s)\n 04:45:15          read pack done 294B in 0.05s (5.4KB/s)\nError: IO error while writing blob or reading file metadata or changing filetype\n\nCaused by:\n    Incorrect function. (os error 1)\n```\n\nThe exact placement of the message is nondeterministic. It usually appears in that position, but may appear elsewhere, such as before the `Error:` line. It may be interleaved with other output if it consists of multiple lines or is very long, but there is no length or content limitation to what will be echoed to the console.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf Windows is not used, or untrusted repositories are not cloned or otherwise used, then there is no impact.\n\nThe impact is expected to be limited in common configurations, but may vary widely depending on what devices exist, how they are being used, how much knowledge an attacker has of the precise details of their use, and whether the user is likely to trust information that appears in a console. Accessing devices through refs is expected to be less dangerous than accessing them through filenames, since it is trivial to attempt to write arbitrary data using filenames.\n\nFor attacks using the `CON` or `CONOUT$` device names, the greatest risk is if a command the user would not otherwise run, and would not be convinced to run by untrusted instructions, seems reasonable when a trusted application such as `gix` appears to recommend it. The user may then be misled into running an attacker's command.\n\nA minor degradation in availability may also be possible, such as with a very large file named `CON`, though the user could usually interrupt the application.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-worktree-state","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-worktree-state"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gitoxide","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gitoxide"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.36.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gix-worktree","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-worktree"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.34.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gitoxide-core","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gitoxide-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.38.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.63.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gix-ref","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-ref"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.44.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gix-index","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-index"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.33.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-49jc-r788-3fc9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35197"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0351.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0352.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0353.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-67"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-05-22T14:13:24Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-05-23T13:15:09Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.639742Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-r8w9-5wcg-vfj7","published":"2024-03-04T20:44:35Z","modified":"2024-07-15T22:12:27.322107Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-27308","RUSTSEC-2024-0019"],"related":["CGA-396h-cjv2-7j93","CGA-3fg3-mcm8-83j9","CGA-6399-mq66-q9qw","CGA-898w-f7g8-6mjc","CGA-fcq2-vg6p-7m94","CGA-mc9w-vgwr-v5mj","CVE-2024-27308"],"summary":"Mio's tokens for named pipes may be delivered after deregistration","details":"### Impact\n\nWhen using named pipes on Windows, mio will under some circumstances return invalid tokens that correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered from the mio registry.

If there was a user record in the new database with identical record identifier as the original record that the user authenticated with in the original database, this could result in the user being able to perform actions under the identity of the unrelated user in the new database. This issue does not affect system users at any level.\n\nBy default, record identifiers are randomly generated with sufficient complexity to prevent the identifier collision required to trigger this issue. However, the issue may trigger in situations where multiple databases in the same SurrealDB instance are using explicitly defined or incremental record identifiers to identify users on an identically named table.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnder the circumstances described above, a user who has an authenticated session as a scope user in a database could become authorized to query data under the identity of a specific scope user associated with an identical record identifier in a different database within the same SurrealDB instace if the `PERMISSIONS` clause would allow it due to relying exclusively on the `$auth` parameter, which would point to the impersonated user. The impact is limited to the single user with matching record identifier.\n\nThe impact of this issue is mitigated if the table `PERMISSIONS` clause explicitly checks for an scope that only exists in the specific database (e.g. `$scope = \"production\"`) or certain claims of the authentication token (e.g. `$token.email = \"example@example.com\"`), both of which would remain unchanged in the session of the authenticated user after changing databases. Permissions will default to `NONE` if there is no `PERMISSIONS` clause, which also mitigates this impact of this issue.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Version 1.5.4 and later are not affected by this issue.\n- Version 2.0.0-alpha.6 and later will not be affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers unable to update may want to ensure that table `PERMISSIONS` clauses explicitly check that the `$scope` parameter matches a scope that is uniquely named across databases in the same SurrealDB instance. Ensuring that record identifiers for users are automatically generated or explicitly generated to be unique across databases may also be sufficient to mitigate this issue, as the `$auth` parameter will not link to any user record and any `PERMISSIONS` clauses restricting authorization based on the authenticated user should fail to successfully evaluate.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4335","affected":[{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.5.3","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-gh9f-6xm2-c4j2/GHSA-gh9f-6xm2-c4j2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"2.0.0-alpha.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 2.0.0-alpha.5","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-gh9f-6xm2-c4j2/GHSA-gh9f-6xm2-c4j2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"surrealdb-core","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.5.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/07/GHSA-gh9f-6xm2-c4j2/GHSA-gh9f-6xm2-c4j2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-gh9f-6xm2-c4j2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/4335"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/492f8378d57968dbdf5e63fad41b6ff59bba0b80"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-287"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-07-11T13:19:19Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.661857Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c","published":"2024-05-22T14:05:58Z","modified":"2024-07-08T16:20:56Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-35186","RUSTSEC-2024-0348","RUSTSEC-2024-0349","RUSTSEC-2024-0350"],"related":["CGA-2fmx-8fhg-29pr","CVE-2024-35186"],"summary":"gix traversal outside working tree enables arbitrary code execution","details":"### Summary\n\nDuring checkout, gitoxide does not verify that paths point to locations in the working tree.

See [GHSA-589j-mmg9-733v](https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-589j-mmg9-733v).\n\nWhen a checkout creates some files outside the repository directory but fails to complete, the repository directory is usually removed, but the outside files remain.\n\n### PoC\n\nFor simplicity, these examples stage a stand-in file with a valid name, modify the index, and commit. The instructions assume `sed` supports `-i`, which is the case on most systems. If using Windows, a Git Bash shell should be used.\n\n#### Example: Downward traversal to install hooks\n\n1. Create a new repository with `git init dangerous-repo-installs-hook` and `cd` into the directory.\n2. Create the stand-in called `.git@hooks@pre-commit`, with the *contents*:\n   ```sh\n   #!/bin/sh\n   printf 'Vulnerable!\\n'\n   date >vulnerable\n   ```\n3. Stage the stand-in: `git add --chmod=+x .git@hooks@pre-commit`\n4. Edit the index: `env LC_ALL=C sed -i.orig 's|\\.git@hooks@pre-commit|.git/hooks/pre-commit|' .git/index`\n5. Commit: `git commit -m 'Initial commit'`\n6. *Optionally*, push to a private remote.\n\nThen, on another or the same machine:\n\n1. Clone the repository with a `gix clone …` command.\n2. Enter the newly created directory.\n3. *Optionally* run `ls -l .git/hooks` to observe that the `pre-commit` hook is already present.\n4. Make a new file and commit it with `git`. This causes the payload surreptitiously installed as a `pre-commit` hook to run, printing the message `Vulnerable!` and creating a file in the current directory containing the current date and time.\n\nNote that the effect is not limited to modifying the current directory. The payload could be written to perform any action that the user who runs `git commit` is capable of.\n\n#### Example: Upward traversal to create a file above the working tree\n\n1. Create a new repository with `git init dangerous-repo-reaches-up`, and `cd` into the directory.\n2. Create the stand-in: `echo 'A file outside the working tree, somehow.' >..@outside`\n3. Stage the stand-in: `git add ..@outside`\n4. Edit the index: `env LC_ALL=C sed -i.orig 's|\\.\\.@outside|../outside|' .git/index`\n5. Commit: `git commit -m 'Initial commit'`\n6. *Optionally*, push to a private remote.\n\nThen, as above, on the same or another machine, clone the repository with a `gix clone …` command. Observe that a file named `outside` is present alongside (not inside) the cloned directory.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny use of `gix` or another application that makes use of `gix-worktree-state`, or otherwise relies on `gix-fs` and `gix-worktree` for validation, is affected, if used to clone untrusted repositories. The above description focuses on code execution, as that leads to a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but creating files outside a working tree without attempting to execute code can directly impact integrity as well.\n\nIn use cases where no untrusted repository is ever cloned, this vulnerability has no impact. Furthermore, the impact of this vulnerability *may* be lower when `gix` is used to clone a repository for CI/CD purposes, even if untrusted, since in such uses the environment is usually isolated and arbitrary code is usually run deliberately from the repository with necessary safeguards in place.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"gix-worktree-state","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-worktree-state"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gitoxide","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gitoxide"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.36.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gix-fs","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-fs"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.11.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gix-worktree","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-worktree"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.34.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.63.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gitoxide-core","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gitoxide-core"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.38.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"gix-index","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/gix-index"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.33.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35186"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0348.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0350.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-23"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-05-22T14:05:58Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-05-23T09:15:09Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.649175Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0348","published":"2024-05-22T12:00:00Z","modified":"2024-07-08T15:42:38.120637Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-35186","GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c","RUSTSEC-2024-0349","RUSTSEC-2024-0350"],"summary":"Traversal outside working tree enables arbitrary code execution","details":"### Summary\n\nDuring checkout, gitoxide does not verify that paths point to locations in the working tree.

Create the stand-in called `.git@hooks@pre-commit`, with the *contents*:\n   ```sh\n   #!/bin/sh\n   printf 'Vulnerable!\\n'\n   date >vulnerable\n   ```\n3. Stage the stand-in: `git add --chmod=+x .git@hooks@pre-commit`\n4. Edit the index: `env LC_ALL=C sed -i.orig 's|\\.git@hooks@pre-commit|.git/hooks/pre-commit|' .git/index`\n5. Commit: `git commit -m 'Initial commit'`\n6. *Optionally*, push to a private remote.\n\nThen, on another or the same machine:\n\n1. Clone the repository with a `gix clone …` command.\n2. Enter the newly created directory.\n3. *Optionally* run `ls -l .git/hooks` to observe that the `pre-commit` hook is already present.\n4. Make a new file and commit it with `git`. This causes the payload surreptitiously installed as a `pre-commit` hook to run, printing the message `Vulnerable!` and creating a file in the current directory containing the current date and time.\n\nNote that the effect is not limited to modifying the current directory. The payload could be written to perform any action that the user who runs `git commit` is capable of.\n\n#### Example: Upward traversal to create a file above the working tree\n\n1. Create a new repository with `git init dangerous-repo-reaches-up`, and `cd` into the directory.\n2. Create the stand-in: `echo 'A file outside the working tree, somehow.' >..@outside`\n3. Stage the stand-in: `git add ..@outside`\n4. Edit the index: `env LC_ALL=C sed -i.orig 's|\\.\\.@outside|../outside|' .git/index`\n5. Commit: `git commit -m 'Initial commit'`\n6. *Optionally*, push to a private remote.\n\nThen, as above, on the same or another machine, clone the repository with a `gix clone …` command. Observe that a file named `outside` is present alongside (not inside) the cloned directory.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny use of `gix` or another application that makes use of `gix-worktree-state`, or otherwise relies on `gix-fs` and `gix-worktree` for validation, is affected, if used to clone untrusted repositories. The above description focuses on code execution, as that leads to a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but creating files outside a working tree without attempting to execute code can directly impact integrity as well.\n\nIn use cases where no untrusted repository is ever cloned, this vulnerability has no impact.

This allows a repository, when cloned, to cause indefinite blocking or the production of arbitrary message that appear to have come from the application, and potentially other harmful effects under limited circumstances.\n\n### Details\n\nIt is possible to create a Git repository that contains references or filenames that Windows treats as legacy DOS-style aliases for system devices. When such a repository is cloned:\n\n- In references, `gix-ref` does not include a check for such names before attempting to access them on disk, which reads from the devices, though the ability to exfiltrate data appears limited.\n- In paths, `gix-worktree-state` does not treat such names as collisions and instead writes to them, which writes arbitrary attacker-controlled data to the devices.\n\nSome such device names refer to devices that are often absent or inaccessible. But a few are guaranteed to be available, allowing some attacks to be carried out with low complexity. For both reading refs and writing paths, one important case is the console:\n\n- Reading a ref whose last component (e.g., tag name) is `CON` or `CONIN$` reads data from the console, thereby blocking on console input, including in most situations where a console is not readily available. This may facilitate denial of service attacks.\n- Checking out a file named `CON` or `CONOUT$` writes its contents to the console. This allows an untrusted repository to produce arbitrary text that appears to be a message from the application. Such text may facilitate social engineering if it is selected to instruct the user to perform a particular action.\n\nAnother potentially important case is serial ports. For example, `COM1` refers to the first serial port, if present. A malicious repository may be able to disrupt intended use of serial ports or attempt to interact with a device. In some configurations, it may be possible to interfere with the operation of a physical or virtual serial console. On Windows, local access to serial ports is often permitted even for limited user accounts without elevation.\n\n[Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions) covers most reserved names. `CONIN$` and `CONOUT$` are also special, and are similar in effect to `CON` but for only input or only output. These names are case-insensitive and can also be accessed with file extensions (e.g, `CON.txt` is equivalent to `CON`) and with some variations involving added spaces or colons.\n\n### PoC\n\n#### Ref example\n\nCreate a repository on a non-Windows system (or in WSL) with at least one commit. Use `git tag CON` to create a lightweight tag named `CON`. Place the repository somewhere it can be cloned on Windows. A `file://` URL is sufficient for testing if a private remote is unavailable. If using `git push`, pass `--tags` so the remote has the tag.\n\nOn a Windows system, clone the repository with `gix clone`. This command will block immediately, reading input from the console. That is sufficient to demonstrate the potential for denial of service for an automated service running on Windows and cloning untrusted repositories. The experiment can be stopped with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.\n\nHowever, if desired, input can be provided. Ending input with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> will cause it to be passed to the application. This will lead to an error message, the specific details of which vary by whether the input is empty or nonempty, and whether it matches or does not match the hexadecimal hash of the tagged commit.\n\n#### Path example\n\nCreate a repository on a non-Windows system (or in WSL) and commit a file named `CON` with the contents:\n\n```text\nwarning: data loss imminent; you should run EVIL_COMMAND to back up your work!\n```\n\nWhile that example text serves to illustrate the risk, any distinctive text is sufficient to observe the vulnerability. Place the repository somewhere it can be cloned on Windows. As above, a `file://` URL is sufficient.\n\nOn a Windows system, clone the repository with `gix clone`. The output usually looks like this, with the deceptive message appearing to come from `gix`:\n\n```text\nwarning: data loss imminent; you should run EVIL_COMMAND to back up your work!\n 04:45:15 indexing done 3.0 objects in 0.00s (12.1K objects/s)\n 04:45:15 decompressing done 309B in 0.00s (1.2MB/s)\n 04:45:15     Resolving done 3.0 objects in 0.05s (58.0 objects/s)\n 04:45:15      Decoding done 309B in 0.05s (6.0KB/s)\n 04:45:15 writing index file done 1.2KB in 0.00s (7.0MB/s)\n 04:45:15  create index file done 3.0 objects in 0.05s (55.0 objects/s)\n 04:45:15          read pack done 294B in 0.05s (5.4KB/s)\nError: IO error while writing blob or reading file metadata or changing filetype\n\nCaused by:\n    Incorrect function. (os error 1)\n```\n\nThe exact placement of the message is nondeterministic. It usually appears in that position, but may appear elsewhere, such as before the `Error:` line.

A specially crafted clone URL can smuggle options to SSH. The possibilities are syntactically limited, but if a malicious clone URL is used by an application whose current working directory contains a malicious file, arbitrary code execution occurs.\n\n### Details\n\nThis is related to the patched vulnerability https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rrjw-j4m2-mf34, but appears less severe due to a greater attack complexity. Since https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/pull/1032, `gix-transport` checks the host and path portions of a URL for text that has a `-` in a position that will cause `ssh` to interpret part of all of the URL as an option argument. But it does not check the non-mandatory username portion of the URL.\n\nAs in Git, when an address is a URL of the form `ssh://username@hostname/path`, or when it takes the special form `username@hostname:dirs/repo`, this is treated as an SSH URL. `gix-transport` will replace some characters in `username` with their `%`-based URL encodings, but otherwise passes `username@hostname` as an argument to the external `ssh` command. This happens even if `username` begins with a hyphen. In that case, `ssh` treats that argument as an option argument, and attempts to interpret and honor it as a sequence of one or more options possibly followed by an operand for the last option.\n\nThis is harder to exploit than GHSA-rrjw-j4m2-mf34, because the possibilities are constrained by:\n\n- The difficulty of forming an option argument `ssh` accepts, given that characters such as `=`, `/`, and `\\`, are URL-encoded, `:` is removed, and the argument passed to `ssh` contains the `@` sign and subsequent host identifier, which in an effective attack must be parseable as a suffix of the operand passed to the last option.\n\n  The inability to include a literal `=` prevents the use of `-oNAME=VALUE` (e.g., `-oProxyCommand=payload`). The inability to include a literal `/` or `\\` prevents smuggling in a path operand residing outside the current working directory, incuding on Windows. (Although a `~` character may be smuggled in, `ssh` does not perform its own tilde expansion, so it does not form an absolute path.)\n\n- The difficulty, or perhaps impossibility, of completing a connection (other than when arbitrary code execution has been achieved). This complicates or altogether prevents the use of options such as `-A` and `-X` together with a connection to a real but malicious server. The reason a connection cannot generally be completed when exploiting this vulnerability is that, because the argument `gix-transport` intends as a URL is treated as an option argument, `ssh` treats the subsequent non-option argument `git-upload-pack` as the host instead of the command, but it is not a valid host name.\n\n  Although `ssh` supports aliases for hosts, even if `git-upload-pack` could be made an alias, that is made difficult by the URL-encoding transformation.\n\nHowever, an attacker who is able to cause a specially named `ssh` configuration file to be placed in the current working directory can smuggle in an `-F` option referencing the file, and this allows arbitrary command execution.\n\nThis scenario is especially plausible because programs that operate on git repositories are often run in untrusted git repositories, sometimes even to operate on another repository. Situations where this is likely, such that an attacker could predict or arrange it, may for some applications include a malicious repository with a malicious submodule configuration.\n\nOther avenues of exploitation exist, but appear to be less severe. For example, the `-E` option can be smuggled to create or append to a file in the current directory (or its target, if it is a symlink). There may also be other significant ways to exploit this that have not yet been discovered, or that would arise with new options in future versions of `ssh`.\n\n### PoC\n\nTo reproduce the known case that facilitates arbitrary code execution, first create a file in the current directory named `configfile@example.com`, of the form\n\n```text\nProxyCommand payload\n```\n\nwhere `payload` is a command with an observable side effect. On Unix-like systems, this could be `date | tee vulnerable` or an `xdg-open`, `open`, or other command command to launch a graphical application. On Windows, this could be the name of a graphical application already in the search path, such as `calc.exe`.\n\n(Although the syntax permitted in the value of `ProxyCommand` may vary by platform, this is not limited to running commands in the current directory. That limitation only applies to paths directly smuggled in the username, not to the contents of a separate malicious configuration file. Arbitrary other settings may be specified in `configfile@example.com` as well.)\n\nThen run:\n\n```sh\ngix clone 'ssh://-Fconfigfile@example.com/abc'\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```sh\ngix clone -- '-Fconfigfile@example.com:abc/def'\n```\n\n(The `--` is required to ensure that `gix` is really passing the argument as a URL for use in `gix-transport`, rather than interpreting it as an option itself, which would not necessarily be a vulnerability.)\n\nIn either case, the payload specified in `configfile@example.com` runs, and its side effect can be observed.\n\nOther cases may likewise be produced, in either of the above two forms of SSH addresses.

A specially crafted clone URL can smuggle options to SSH. The possibilities are syntactically limited, but if a malicious clone URL is used by an application whose current working directory contains a malicious file, arbitrary code execution occurs.\n\nThe first `gix` crate with the fix [is version 0.62.0](https://crates.io/crates/gix/0.62.0), and the first fixed `gix` CLI is [version 0.35](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/releases/tag/v0.35.0). `gix-transport` [at version v0.42](https://crates.io/crates/gix-transport/0.42.0) is the lowest-level plumbing crate with the fix.\n\n### Details\n\nThis is related to the patched vulnerability [RUSTSEC-2023-0064](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0064.html), but appears less severe due to a greater attack complexity. Since <https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/pull/1032>, `gix-transport` checks the host and path portions of a URL for text that has a `-` in a position that will cause `ssh` to interpret part of all of the URL as an option argument. But it does not check the non-mandatory username portion of the URL.\n\nAs in Git, when an address is a URL of the form `ssh://username@hostname/path`, or when it takes the special form `username@hostname:dirs/repo`, this is treated as an SSH URL. `gix-transport` will replace some characters in `username` with their `%`-based URL encodings, but otherwise passes `username@hostname` as an argument to the external `ssh` command. This happens even if `username` begins with a hyphen. In that case, `ssh` treats that argument as an option argument, and attempts to interpret and honor it as a sequence of one or more options possibly followed by an operand for the last option.\n\nThis is harder to exploit than [RUSTSEC-2023-0064](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0064.html), because the possibilities are constrained by:\n\n- The difficulty of forming an option argument `ssh` accepts, given that characters such as `=`, `/`, and `\\`, are URL-encoded, `:` is removed, and the argument passed to `ssh` contains the `@` sign and subsequent host identifier, which in an effective attack must be parseable as a suffix of the operand passed to the last option.\n\n  The inability to include a literal `=` prevents the use of `-oNAME=VALUE` (e.g., `-oProxyCommand=payload`). The inability to include a literal `/` or `\\` prevents smuggling in a path operand residing outside the current working directory, including on Windows. (Although a `~` character may be smuggled in, `ssh` does not perform its own tilde expansion, so it does not form an absolute path.)\n\n- The difficulty, or perhaps impossibility, of completing a connection (other than when arbitrary code execution has been achieved). This complicates or altogether prevents the use of options such as `-A` and `-X` together with a connection to a real but malicious server. The reason a connection cannot generally be completed when exploiting this vulnerability is that, because the argument `gix-transport` intends as a URL is treated as an option argument, `ssh` treats the subsequent non-option argument `git-upload-pack` as the host instead of the command, but it is not a valid host name.\n\n  Although `ssh` supports aliases for hosts, even if `git-upload-pack` could be made an alias, that is made difficult by the URL-encoding transformation.\n\nHowever, an attacker who is able to cause a specially named `ssh` configuration file to be placed in the current working directory can smuggle in an `-F` option referencing the file, and this allows arbitrary command execution.\n\nThis scenario is especially plausible because programs that operate on git repositories are often run in untrusted git repositories, sometimes even to operate on another repository. Situations where this is likely, such that an attacker could predict or arrange it, may for some applications include a malicious repository with a malicious submodule configuration.\n\nOther avenues of exploitation exist, but appear to be less severe. For example, the `-E` option can be smuggled to create or append to a file in the current directory (or its target, if it is a symlink). There may also be other significant ways to exploit this that have not yet been discovered, or that would arise with new options in future versions of `ssh`.\n\n### PoC\n\nTo reproduce the known case that facilitates arbitrary code execution, first create a file in the current directory named `configfile@example.com`, of the form\n\n```text\nProxyCommand payload\n```\n\nwhere `payload` is a command with an observable side effect. On Unix-like systems, this could be `date | tee vulnerable` or an `xdg-open`, `open`, or other command command to launch a graphical application. On Windows, this could be the name of a graphical application already in the search path, such as `calc.exe`.\n\n(Although the syntax permitted in the value of `ProxyCommand` may vary by platform, this is not limited to running commands in the current directory. That limitation only applies to paths directly smuggled in the username, not to the contents of a separate malicious configuration file. Arbitrary other settings may be specified in `configfile@example.com` as well.)\n\nThen run:\n\n```sh\ngix clone 'ssh://-Fconfigfile@example.com/abc'\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```sh\ngix clone -- '-Fconfigfile@example.com:abc/def'\n```\n\n(The `--` is required to ensure that `gix` is really passing the argument as a URL for use in `gix-transport`, rather than interpreting it as an option itself, which would not necessarily be a vulnerability.)\n\nIn either case, the payload specified in `configfile@example.com` runs, and its side effect can be observed.\n\nOther cases may likewise be produced, in either of the above two forms of SSH addresses. For example, to create or append to the file `errors@example.com`, or to create or append to its target if it is a symlink:\n\n```sh\ngix clone 'ssh://-Eerrors@example.com/abc'\n```\n\n```sh\ngix clone -- '-Eerrors@example.com:abc/def'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nAs in [RUSTSEC-2023-0064](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0064.html), this would typically require user interaction to trigger an attempt to clone or otherwise connect using the malicious URL.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit.

Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

Previously, we injected the Tauri IPC initialization script into iFrames on MacOS, which was unintended. This is now also disabled to be consistent with all other supported operating systems.\n\nThis means that the Tauri invoke functionality is no longer accessible from iFrames, except on Windows when the origin of the Tauri window and the origin of the iFrame are the same.\n\nWe have also added a new protection mechanism to the IPC layer to protect against iFrames directly using the WebView IPC functionality (e.g. via `window.ipc.postMessage`).\nThis introduces an invoke key (`__TAURI_INVOKE_KEY__`) which is used to prevent frames that have not been initialized by the Tauri core from sending messages to the Tauri IPC.\nThis key is **not** used to protect against compromised Tauri windows or WebViews and is **only** intended to block IPC access from sub-frames.\n\nUnauthorized messages to the Tauri IPC from an iFrame or other non-initialized context will log a warning and the potentially malicious IPC call will be ignored.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThese workarounds should only be considered if you are unable to upgrade to the patched Tauri version in time.\n\nAs a workaround for v1 Tauri applications, we recommend using a dedicated window for untrusted origins instead of iFrames, or disabling script execution within the iFrame.\n\nFor v2 Tauri applications targeting Linux, it is possible to use either a dedicated window or [multiple WebViews](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/examples/multiwebview) in the main window to simulate iFrame behavior.\nOn other platforms, it is only possible to use dedicated windows or disable script execution inside the iFrame, as described for v1.\n\n## References\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in tauri or\nEmail us at [security@tauri.app](mailto:security@tauri.app)\n\nThe original submissions from the reporter:\n\n> ### Context\n> \n> This is following up on the comments here: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8316, and here: https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1227969106091966475. I was asked to submit my findings as a vulnerability report.\n> \n> Firstly, thank you to all of you from the core team that helped out and guided me through understanding this issue! Huge fan of Tauri, and I'm excited to see it succeed!\n> \n> ### Summary\n> \n> In short, **any iframe you add in your Tauri frontend will get access to Tauri APIs, even in isolation mode**.\n> \n> Any embedded iframe that you don't own will be able to invoke the same APIs your app does. While isolation mode allows for finer grained control of what Tauri APIs can be called, it is not possible to determine if a request is coming your own app, or from a potentially malicious iframe.\n> \n> This means your app could be open to malicious iframe being able to execute any command your app can, and there doesn't seem to be a mechanism to filter these out.\n> \n> ### Details\n> \n> I'm not an expert in Tauri source code, so I can't be sure I'm on the right track here, but I assume this has to do with how the webview is bootstrapped with the Tauri APIs.\n> \n> I know there's various handlers that get set, such as opening `target=\"_blank\"` links via a shell command, and of course setting `invoke` and other such APIs. Sounds like the issue is somewhere there and the APIs are being injected where they shouldn't.\n> \n> Technically it seems that an attacker couldn't actually receive a response from the command it executes.

\nthe circuit manager code would build the circuits with one hop too few.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis makes users of this code more vulnerable to some kinds of traffic analysis\nwhen they run or visit onion services.\n\n## Vulnerable configurations and use cases\n\nArti configured with \"vangaurds lite\" is vulnerable;\nthis is the default.\n\nOnly users who make connections to Onion Services\n(Tor Hidden Services) are affected.\nNote, however, that when used as a browser proxy,\nmalicious web pages can typically make such connections.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nEnable the \"full vanguards\" feature.\nThis has some cost in terms of performance, reliability,\nand impact on the Tor Network.\n\n(Arti configured with \"full vanguards\" has a similar bug,\nTROVE-2024-04,\nso this will not deliver the full incressed security of \"full vanguards\";\nbut the security level of affected versions of Arti\nconfigured with \"full vanguards\" still exceeds\nthe intended security level of the \"vanguards lite\" configuration.)\n\nAlternatively,\npreventing access to Tor Hidden Services will avoid the problem,\nwith corresponding loss of functionality.\nThis can be achieved in the Arti

versions\n\nEven though earlier versions are classified as \"not affected\",\nthis is because in those versions the Vanguards feature\nis experimental, or absent.\nDowngrading worsens security, rather

The Spin application's component handling the incoming request is configured with an `allowed_outbound_hosts` list containing `\"self\"`.\n3. In reaction to an incoming request, the component makes an outbound request whose URL doesn't include the hostname/port.\n\nIf all of these conditions apply, then Spin will use the inbound request's `Host` header to determine the `authority` part of the URL if none is explicitly provided in the request's URL.\n\n#### Setups known not to be vulnerable\n\nFermyon's [Fermyon Cloud](https://developer.fermyon.com/cloud/index) serverless product and applications hosted on it are known not to be vulnerable.\n\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched?

These versions were released on 2024-04-12 and 2024-04-22 respectively.\n\nThe affected versions of Apollo Router contain a bug that could lead to unexpected operations being executed, which can result in unintended data or effects. This only affects Router instances configured to use distributed query plan caching. Router versions other than the ones listed above, and all Router deployments that are not using distributed query plan caching, are unaffected by this defect.\n\nIf you are using the affected versions, you can check your router’s configuration YAML to verify if you are impacted:\n\n\n```yaml\nsupergraph:\n  query_planning:\n    cache:\n      # Look for this config below\n      redis:\n        urls: [\"redis://...\"]\n```\nA full reference on the[ Distributed Query Plan Caching feature is available here.](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/distributed-caching/#distributed-query-plan-caching)\n\n### Impact detail\nThe root cause of this defect is a bug in Apollo Router’s cache retrieval logic: When this defect is present and distributed query planning caching is enabled, asking the Router to execute an operation (whether it is a query, a mutation, or a subscription) may result in an unexpected variation of that operation being executed or the generation of unexpected errors.  \n\nThe issue stems from inadvertently executing a modified version of a previously executed operation, whose query plan is stored in the underlying cache (specifically, Redis). Depending on the type of the operation, the result may vary.  For a query, results may be fetched that don’t match what was requested (e.g., rather than running `fetchUsers(type: ENTERPRISE)` the Router may run `fetchUsers(type: TRIAL)`.  For a mutation, this may result in incorrect mutations being sent to underlying subgraph servers (e.g., rather than sending `deleteUser(id: 10)` to a subgraph, the Router may run `deleteUser(id: 12)`.\n\n### Patches\nApollo Router 1.45.1\n\nIf you are using distributed query plan caching, please either upgrade to version 1.45.1 or above or downgrade to version 1.43.2 of the Apollo Router. We do not recommend Apollo Router versions 1.44.0 or 1.45.0 for use and have withdrawn these releases. If you use impacted versions in production, we recommend that you migrate away immediately by redeploying to an unaffected Router version. For non-production use cases, we recommend you migrate at your earliest convenience.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade or downgrade, you can disable distributed query plan caching by removing the `supergraph.query_planning.cache.redis.urls` configuration. Please note that when distributed query plan caching is disabled, each Router instance will maintain its own in-memory query plan cache. This may increase resource utilization for each Router instance and could increase cold-start times as each Router instance builds its query plan cache.\n\n### References\n[Apollo Router 1.45.1 Release Notes](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.45.1)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apollo-router","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/apollo-router"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.44.0"},{"fixed":"1.45.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-q9p4-hw9m-fj2v/GHSA-q9p4-hw9m-fj2v.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-q9p4-hw9m-fj2v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32971"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/ff9f666598cd17661880fe7fc6e9c9611316e529"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.45.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/configuration/distributed-caching/#distributed-query-plan-caching"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-440"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-05-02T08:20:00Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-05-02T07:15:21Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.674453Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3999-5ffv-wp2r","published":"2024-05-01T16:40:49Z","modified":"2024-05-01T16:58:38.971779Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-32984"],"related":["CVE-2024-32984"],"summary":"Yamux Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability via Active::pending_frames property ","details":"### Summary\n\nAttack scenario\nThe Rust implementation of the Yamux stream multiplexer uses a vector for pending frames. This vector is not bounded in length. Every time the Yamux protocol requires sending of a new frame, this frame gets appended to this vector. This can be remotely triggered in a number of ways, for example by:\n\n1. Opening a new libp2p Identify stream. This causes the node to send its Identify message. Of course, every other protocol that causes the sending of data also works. The larger the response, the more data is enqueued.\n2. Sending a Yamux Ping frame. This causes a Pong frame to be enqueued.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this queue of pending frames would be drained once they’re sent out over the network. However, the attacker can use TCP’s receive window mechanism to prevent the victim from sending out any data: By not reading from the TCP connection, the receive window will never be increased, and the victim won’t be able to send out any new data (this is how TCP implements backpressure). Once this happens, Yamux’s queue of pending frames will start growing indefinitely. The queue will only be drained once the underlying TCP connection is closed.\n\nComponents\nhttps://github.com/libp2p/rust-yamux/blob/yamux-v0.13.1/yamux/src/connection.rs#L289\n\n### Details\nThis attack is inspired by the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack (CVE 2023-44487), HTTP/2 Ping Flood (CVE-2019-9512), and the QUIC Path Validation attack (see my blog post: https://seemann.io/posts/2023-12-18-exploiting-quics-path-validation/).\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a remote node to run out of memory, which will result in the corresponding process getting terminated by the operating system.\n\nDepending on the application protocols running on top of rust-libp2p, higher amplification factors are possible. For example, image a protocol that sends out 10 MB of data as a result of an incoming request. By issuing that request and sending a Yamux stream window update (together ~100-200 bytes), the victim would now enqueue the entire 10 MB into its frame buffer.

Code that uses the item and then advances the iterator is unaffected. This problem has always existed.\n\nThis is a use-after-free bug, so it's rated high severity. If your code uses a pre-3.0.0 version of cassandra-rs, and uses an item returned by a cassandra-rs iterator after calling `next()` on that iterator, then it is vulnerable. However, such code will almost always fail immediately - so we believe it is unlikely that any code using this pattern would have reached production. For peace of mind, we recommend you upgrade anyway.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in version 3.0.0 (commit 299e6ac50f87eb2823a373baec37b590a74994ee). Users should upgrade to ensure their code cannot use the problematic pattern. There is an upgrade guide in the project README.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nEnsure all usage fits the expected pattern. For example, use `get_first_row()` rather than an iterator, or completely process an item before advancing the iterator with `next()`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cassandra-cpp","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cassandra-cpp"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"3.0.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["memory-corruption","memory-exposure"],"cvss":null,"informational":"unsound","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0017.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/cassandra-cpp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0017.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/Metaswitch/cassandra-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-x9xc-63hg-vcfq"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.715371Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0331","published":"2024-03-31T12:00:00Z","modified":"2024-03-31T14:44:37Z","summary":"Puccinier is unmainted.","details":"The tool has been deprecated in favor of Catppuccin's new tool, [whiskers](https://github.com/catppuccin/toolbox/tree/main/whiskers) [(crates.io)](https://crates.io/crates/catppuccin-whiskers).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"puccinier","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/puccinier"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":null,"informational":"unmaintained","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2024-0331.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/puccinier"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0331.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/catppuccin/toolbox/issues/66"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.715655Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-jw36-hf63-69r9","published":"2022-08-04T00:00:26Z","modified":"2024-03-27T18:33:45Z","aliases":["BIT-sqlite-2022-35737","CVE-2022-35737","RUSTSEC-2022-0090"],"summary":"`libsqlite3-sys` via C SQLite improperly validates array index","details":"SQLite 1.0.12 through 3.39.x before 3.39.2 sometimes allows an array-bounds overflow if billions of bytes are used in a string argument to a C API.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libsqlite3-sys","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/libsqlite3-sys"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.25.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/08/GHSA-jw36-hf63-69r9/GHSA-jw36-hf63-69r9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35737"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/10/25/sqlite-vulnerability-july-2022-library-api"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/720344"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0090.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-40"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220915-0009"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_2.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-129"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-02-15T15:38:06Z","nvd_published_at":"2022-08-03T06:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.668058Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp","published":"2024-03-05T20:49:14Z","modified":"2024-03-21T18:29:19Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-27935"],"related":["CVE-2024-27935"],"summary":"Deno's Node.js Compatibility Runtime has Cross-Session Data Contamination","details":"### Summary\n\nA vulnerability in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption and unexpected behavior.\n\n### Details\n\nA bug in Deno's Node.js compatibility runtime results in data cross-reception during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js network streams. When multiple independent network socket connections are involved, this vulnerability can be triggered. For instance, two separate server sockets that receive data from their respective client sockets and then echo the received data back to the client using Node.js streams may experience an issue where data from one socket may appear on another socket. Due to the improper isolation of the global buffer (`BUF`), data sent by one socket can end up being incorrectly received by another socket. Consequently, data intended for one session may be exposed to another session, potentially leading to data corruption and unexpected behavior.\n\nThis buffer was introduced as a performance optimization to avoid excessive allocations during network read operations.\n\nIn cases where the [net.Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) is connected to a remote server such as a database or key/value store such as Redis, this may result in a packet received on one connection being presented to another, causing data cross-contamination between multiple users and potentially leaking sensitive information.\n\nIt is important to note that this vulnerability does not affect Deno network streams created with the `Deno.listen` and `Deno.connect` APIs. \n\nThe impact of this issue may extend beyond node.js network streams, however, and may also affect asynchronous reads from non-network node.js Stream such as those created from files.\n\n### PoC\n\nhttps://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188\n\n### Impact\n\nThis affects all users of Deno that use the node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries indirectly.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.35.1"},{"fixed":"1.36.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp/GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-wrqv-pf6j-mqjp"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27935"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/20188"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/3e9fb8aafd9834ebacd27734cea4310caaf794c6"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-488"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-05T20:49:14Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-03-21T02:52:22Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.684113Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-6q4w-9x56-rmwq","published":"2024-03-06T17:04:08Z","modified":"2024-03-21T18:29:15Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-27933"],"related":["CVE-2024-27933"],"summary":"Deno arbitrary file descriptor close via `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leading to permission prompt bypass","details":"### Summary\n\nUse of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt bypass.\n\n\n### Details\n\nNode child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a `IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together.\n\nAlthough closing a file descriptor is seemingly a harmless task, this has been known to be exploitable:\n- With `--allow-read` and `--allow-write` permissions, one can open `/dev/ptmx` as stdin. This device happily accepts TTY ioctls and pipes anything written into it back to the reader. \n  - This has been presented in a hacking competition (WACON 2023 Quals \"dino jail\").\n  - However, the precondition of this challenge was heavily contrived: fd 0 has manually been closed by FFI and `setuid()` was used to drop permissions and deny access to `/proc` since global write permissions are usually equivalent to arbitrary code execution (`/proc/self/mem`).\n\nAs this vulnerability conveniently allows us to close stdin (fd 0) without any FFI, we can open any resource that when read returns `y`, `Y` or `A` as its first character ([runtimes/permissions/prompter.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L265)) to bypass the prompt.\n\nThere is a caveat however - all stdio/stdin/stderr streams are [locked](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L214), after which [`clear_stdin()`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L220) is called. This invokes [`libc::tcflush(0, libc::TCIFLUSH)`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L99) which fails on a non-TTY file descriptor.\n\nThis can be exploited by widening the race window between `clear_stdin()` and the next [`stdin_lock.read_line()`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L256). Notably, the prompt message contains the requested resource name (path) which is filtered by [`strip_ansi_codes_and_ascii_control()`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L225). This is also concatenated by [`write!()`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L241) to make a single buffer printed out to stderr. Thus, if we request a very long resource name, the window will widen allowing us to easily and stably race another Worker that closes fd 0 and opens a resource starting with an `A\\n` within the race window.\n\nNote that attacker does not need any permissions to exploit this bug to a full permission prompt bypass, as Cache API can be used to create and open files with controlled content without any permissions. Refer to the Impact section for more details.\n\n\n### PoC\n\nTesting environment is Docker image `denoland/deno:alpine-1.39.0@sha256:95064390f2c115673762bfc4fe15b1a7f81c859038b8c02b277ede7cd8a2ccbf`.\n\nBelow PoC closes stdout (fd 1) and then prints two lines, one on stdout and one on stderr. Only the latter line is shown as stdout file descriptor is closed.\n\n```js\nconst ops = Deno[Deno.internal].core.ops;\n\n// open fd 1 as ipc stream resource\nconst rid = ops.op_node_ipc_pipe(1);\n\n// close resource & fd 1\nDeno.close(rid);\n\n// this should not be seen (stdout)\nconsole.log('not seen');\n\n// but this is seen (stderr)\nconsole.error('seen');\n```\n\nBelow is `/proc/$(pgrep deno)/fd` right after executing the last line of the above PoC. We see that fd 1 is indeed missing.\n\n```text\ntotal 0\ndr-x------ 2 root root 30 Dec 18 07:07 ./\ndr-xr-xr-x 9 root root  0 Dec 18 07:07 ../\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 0 -> /dev/pts/0\nl-wx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 10 -> 'pipe:[159305]'\nlr-x------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 11 -> 'pipe:[159306]'\nl-wx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 12 -> 'pipe:[159306]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 13 -> /deno-dir/dep_analysis_cache_v1\nl-wx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 14 -> 'pipe:[159305]'\nl-wx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 15 -> 'pipe:[159306]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 16 -> /deno-dir/node_analysis_cache_v1\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 17 -> /dev/pts/0\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 18 -> /dev/pts/0\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 19 -> /dev/pts/0\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 2 -> /dev/pts/0\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 20 -> 'anon_inode:[eventpoll]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 21 -> 'anon_inode:[eventfd]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 22 -> 'anon_inode:[eventpoll]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 23 -> 'socket:[159302]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 24 -> 'anon_inode:[eventpoll]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 25 -> 'anon_inode:[eventfd]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 26 -> 'anon_inode:[eventpoll]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 27 -> 'socket:[159302]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 28 -> 'socket:[159310]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 29 -> 'socket:[159308]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 3 -> 'anon_inode:[eventpoll]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 30 -> 'socket:[159309]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 4 -> 'anon_inode:[eventfd]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 5 -> 'anon_inode:[eventpoll]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 6 -> 'socket:[159302]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 7 -> 'socket:[159303]'\nlrwx------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 8 -> 'socket:[159302]'\nlr-x------ 1 root root 64 Dec 18 07:07 9 -> 'pipe:[159305]'\n```\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUse of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0) to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.\n\nThis bug is **known to be exploitable** - there is a working exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.\n\n> Note that Deno's security model is currently described as follows:\n> - All runtime I/O is considered to be privileged and must always be guarded by a runtime permission. This includes filesystem access, network access, etc.\n>   - The only exception to this is runtime storage explosion attacks that are isolated to a part of the file system, caused by evaluated code (for example, caching big dependencies or no limits on runtime caches such as the Web Cache API).\n>\n> Although it is ambiguous if the fundamental lack of file system permission checks on Web Cache API is a vulnerability or not, the reporter have not reported this as a vulnerability assuming that this is a known risk (or a feature).\n\nAffected version of Deno is 1.39.0.\n\n- Introduced with commit 5a91a06\n- Fixed with commit 55fac9f\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.39.0"},{"fixed":"1.39.1"}]}],"versions":["1.39.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-6q4w-9x56-rmwq/GHSA-6q4w-9x56-rmwq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-6q4w-9x56-rmwq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27933"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/55fac9f5ead6d30996400e8597c969b675c5a22b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/5a91a065b882215dde209baf626247e54c21a392"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L214"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L220"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L225"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L241"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L256"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L265"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v1.39.0/runtime/permissions/prompter.rs#L99"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-06T17:04:08Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-03-21T02:52:22Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.646028Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-5frw-4rwq-xhcr","published":"2024-03-06T17:03:36Z","modified":"2024-03-21T18:25:42Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-27932"],"related":["CVE-2024-27932"],"summary":"Deno's improper suffix match testing for DENO_AUTH_TOKENS","details":"### Summary\n\nDeno improperly checks that an import specifier's hostname is equal to or a child of a token's hostname, which can cause tokens to be sent to servers they shouldn't be sent to.

The peer can create new IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue. \n\n### Patches\n\nQuiche versions 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem. There is no workaround for affected versions.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"quiche","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/quiche"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.19.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-xhg9-xwch-vr7x/GHSA-xhg9-xwch-vr7x.json"}},{"package":{"name":"quiche","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/quiche"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.20.0"},{"fixed":"0.20.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-xhg9-xwch-vr7x/GHSA-xhg9-xwch-vr7x.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/security/advisories/GHSA-xhg9-xwch-vr7x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1410"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/commit/0c5733a84c41e9e178adc866b11ce59ac264f5af"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/commit/5be8143126f8cfa8a483d4a5ae475b9a46053fa1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/commit/7ab42af5f5e97f20f1d63b7ea2f9ab0536678c40"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/commit/a983998c4408605905ee9a6ab0fc00e68436ac67"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/releases/tag/0.19.2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/releases/tag/0.20.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-13T15:38:21Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-03-12T18:15:07Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.686256Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3qx3-6hxr-j2ch","published":"2024-02-08T18:47:28Z","modified":"2024-03-06T16:12:04.928114Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-25817"],"related":["CVE-2024-25817"],"summary":"eza Potential Heap Overflow Vulnerability for AArch64","details":"### Summary\nIn `eza`, there exists a potential heap overflow vulnerability, first seen when using Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi series system, on `ubuntu-raspi` kernel, relating to the `.git` directory.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability seems to be triggered by the `.git` directory in some projects.

Thus, if the user has more than twice as many groups as the initial buffer size of 8, the next call to getgrouplist will then write past the end of the buffer.\n\nThe issue would require editing /etc/groups to exploit, which is usually only editable by the root user.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/nix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.16.0"},{"fixed":"0.20.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-76w9-p8mg-j927/GHSA-76w9-p8mg-j927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/nix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.21.0"},{"fixed":"0.21.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-76w9-p8mg-j927/GHSA-76w9-p8mg-j927.json"}},{"package":{"name":"nix","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/nix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.22.0"},{"fixed":"0.22.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-76w9-p8mg-j927/GHSA-76w9-p8mg-j927.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45707"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nix-rust/nix/issues/1541"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wgrg-5h56-jg27"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/nix-rust/nix"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustsec/advisory-db/main/crates/nix/RUSTSEC-2021-0119.md"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0119.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-787"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-01-05T23:13:23Z","nvd_published_at":"2021-12-27T00:15:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.647326Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q3gg-m8hr-h4x4","published":"2024-02-21T00:04:05Z","modified":"2024-02-21T00:04:05Z","summary":"Externally Controlled Format String in Scripting Functions","details":"The `rquickjs` crate used by SurrealDB implements Rust bindings to the QuickJS C library and is used to execute SurrealDB scripting functions. The `rquickjs` function `Exception::throw_type` takes a string and returns an error object. Prior to version `0.4.2` of the crate, this string would be fed directly into `printf`, which will receive the error string as a format string with no additional arguments, leading to undefined behavior. This issue triggers when a SurrealDB scripting function returns an error and its input contains a format string such as `%s` or `%d`. \n\nThis vulnerability can only affect SurrealDB servers explicitly enabling the scripting capability with `--allow-scripting` or `--allow-all` and equivalent environment variables `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_SCRIPT=true` and `SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_ALL=true`.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker with privileges to execute scripting functions with arbitrary inputs may be able to exploit this format string vulnerability in order read arbitrary memory from the remote SurrealDB process. A format string vulnerability may also be further exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SurrealDB process.\n\nThe fact that error messages are limited to 256 bytes coupled with [exploit mitigation features supported in Rust executables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/exploit-mitigations.html#exploit-mitigations-1) may somewhat increase the complexity of exploiting this vulnerability to reliably achieve remote code execution in practice.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Version 1.1.1 and later are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers unable to update should restrict access from untrusted users to define and execute scripting functions. This can be achieved by removing the scripting capability by default or with `--deny-scripting` and equivalent environment variable `SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_SCRIPT=true`. If not possible, network access should be limited to trusted users.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/3327\n- https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/3332\n- https://github.com/DelSkayn/rquickjs/pull/247","affected":[{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/02/GHSA-q3gg-m8hr-h4x4/GHSA-q3gg-m8hr-h4x4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-q3gg-m8hr-h4x4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/3327"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/3332"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-02-21T00:04:05Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.673550Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-6wr5-jmpr-mjcx","published":"2024-02-21T00:03:06Z","modified":"2024-02-21T00:03:06Z","summary":"Uncaught Exception in Macro Expecting Native Function to Exist","details":"The query executor would panic when executing a query containing a call to a built-in SurrealDB function that did not exist.

Depending on the specific nature of the program this may enable Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs) which can cause a catastrophic breakage of the cipher including full plaintext recovery.\n\n### Details\nAs seen in the implementation of [decrypt_in_place_detached](https://docs.rs/aes-gcm/latest/src/aes_gcm/lib.rs.html#309) for AES GCM, if the tag verification fails, an error is returned. Because the decryption of the ciphertext is done in place, the plaintext contents are now exposed via `buffer`. \n\nThis should ideally not be the case - as noted in page 17 of[ NIST's publication _Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC_](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf): \n_In Step 8, the result of Step 7 is compared with the authentication tag that was received as an input: if they are identical, then the plaintext is returned; otherwise,FAIL is returned._\n\nThis is seems correctly addressed in the [AES GCM SIV implementation](https://docs.rs/aes-gcm-siv/latest/src/aes_gcm_siv/lib.rs.html#307), where the decrypted buffer is encrypted again before the error is returned - this fix is straightforward to implement in AES GCM. To ensure that these types of cases are covered during testing, it would be valuable to add test cases like [23, 24 ](https://github.com/google/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors/aes_gcm_test.json#L288)etc from [project wycheproof ](https://github.com/google/wycheproof)to ensure that when a bad tag is used, there is an error on decryption _**and**_ that the plaintext value is not exposed. \n\n### PoC\nTo reproduce this issue, I'm using [test case 23](https://github.com/google/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors/aes_gcm_test.json#L288) from project wycheproof. \n```rust\n    let key = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f\"));\n    let nonce = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"505152535455565758595a5b\"));\n    let tag = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"d9847dbc326a06e988c77ad3863e6083\")); // bad tag\n    let mut ct = hex!(\"eb156d081ed6b6b55f4612f021d87b39\");\n    let msg = hex!(\"202122232425262728292a2b2c2d2e2f\");\n    let aad = hex!(\"\");\n    let cipher = Aes128Gcm::new(&key);\n    let _plaintext = cipher.decrypt_in_place_detached(&nonce, &aad, &mut ct, &tag);\n    assert_eq!(ct, msg);\n```","affected":[{"package":{"name":"aes-gcm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/aes-gcm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.10.0"},{"fixed":"0.10.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.10.2","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/09/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/security/advisories/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42811"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/aes-gcm/latest/src/aes_gcm/lib.rs.html#309"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ROBB6TBDAGEQ2WIINR34F3DPSN3FND6K"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RYQCICN6BVC6I75O3F6W4VK4J3MOYDJU"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U67ZSMNX5V3WTBYPUYF45PSFG4SF5SGF"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-09-22T16:11:47Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-09-22T16:15:10Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.638554Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-22q8-ghmq-63vf","published":"2024-02-12T15:42:14Z","modified":"2024-02-15T01:26:53.398583Z","aliases":["RUSTSEC-2024-0013"],"related":["CGA-mgr7-q997-phwg"],"summary":"libgit2-sys affected by memory corruption, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution in libgit2","details":"The [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/) project fixed three security issues in the 1.7.2 release.

stack use-after-free in `Instrumented::into_inner`","details":"The implementation of the [`Instrumented::into_inner`] method in affected\nversions of this crate contains undefined behavior due to incorrect use of\n[`std::mem::forget`] The function creates `*const` pointers to `self`, calls\n[`mem::forget(self)`][`std::mem::forget`], and then moves values out of those\npointers using [`std::ptr::read`].\n\n```rust\n// To manually destructure `Instrumented` without `Drop`, we\n// move it into a ManuallyDrop and use pointers to its fields\nlet span: *const Span = &this.span;\nlet inner: *const ManuallyDrop<T> = &this.inner;\nmem::forget(self);\n// SAFETY: Those pointers are valid for reads, because `Drop` didn't\n//         run, and properly aligned, because `Instrumented` isn't\n//         `#[repr(packed)]`.\nlet _span = unsafe { span.read() };\nlet inner = unsafe { inner.read() };\n```\n\nHowever, the [`mem::forget` documentation][`std::mem::forget`] states:\n\n> Any resources the value manages, such as heap memory or a file handle, will\n> linger forever in an unreachable state. **However, it does not guarantee that\n> pointers to this memory will remain valid.**\n\nThis means that these pointers are no longer valid. This could result in a stack\nuse-after-free if LLVM chooses to reuse `self`'s stack slot for a rebinding\nafter the call to [`std::mem::forget`].\n\nThis undefined behavior has not been observed to cause miscompilation as of Rust\n1.73.0. However, any use of this method with the affected versions of `tracing`\nare unsound.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit [20a1762] ([PR #2765]) by replacing the use of\n[`std::mem::forget`] with `std::mem::ManuallyDrop`, ensuring that the stack slot\nis not reused and the pointers remain valid when they are read.

created by any user, or at least by any admin, this would allow an instance admin to create reports and obtain the message contents from the report system.\n\nThis was originally discovered from incorrect reports on a 0.18.5 instance and has been replicated in a 0.19.0 test environment.\n\n### PoC\n\n```bash\ncurl -v 'https://myinstance.tld/api/v3/private_message/report' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'authorization: Bearer ...' --data-raw '{\"private_message_id\":1,\"reason\":\"i like reports\"}'\n```\n\n### Impact\nAny authenticated user can obtain arbitrary (untargeted) private message contents.\nPrivileges required depend on the instance configuration; when registratons are enabled without application system, the privileges required are practically none.\nWhen registration applications are required, privileges required could be considered low, but this assessment heavily varies by instance.\n\n### Detection\n\nAny private message reports where the report creator is not equal to the private message recipient may be an attempt to exploit this.\nAs this was originally discovered from an incorrect report, likely related to a bug in a client app, it should be noted that not all mismatching reports should be considered malicious; though a frequent occurrence of them likely indicates an exploitation attempt.\n\n### Workaround when updating is not immediately possible\n\nIf an update to a fixed Lemmy version is not immediately possible, the API route can be blocked in the reverse proxy.\nThis will prevent anyone from reporting private messages, but it will also prevent exploitation before the update has been applied.\n\nnginx example:\n```nginx\nlocation = /api/v3/private_message/report {\n  default_type application/json;\n  return 403 '{\"error\":\"couldnt_create_report\"}';\n}\n```","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lemmy_server","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/lemmy_server"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.17.0"},{"fixed":"0.19.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/01/GHSA-r64r-5h43-26qv/GHSA-r64r-5h43-26qv.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/security/advisories/GHSA-r64r-5h43-26qv"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23649"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/commit/bc32b408b523b9b64aa57b8e47748f96cce0dae5"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-01-24T21:13:39Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-01-24T18:15:09Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.676834Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-9f9p-cp3c-72jf","published":"2024-01-24T20:20:38Z","modified":"2024-01-24T21:32:24Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-23644","RUSTSEC-2024-0008","RUSTSEC-2024-0009"],"related":["CVE-2024-23644"],"summary":"Improper

On versions before `0.20.1`, the `tungstenite` crate presented an issue which allowed the parsing of HTTP headers during the client handshake to continuously consume high CPU when the headers were very long. All affected crates have been updated in SurrealDB version `1.1.0`.\n\nFrom the original advisory for [CVE-2023-43669](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43669):\n\"The Tungstenite crate through 0.20.0 for Rust allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (minutes of CPU consumption) via an excessive length of an HTTP header in a client handshake. The length affects both how many times a parse is attempted (e.g., thousands of times) and the average amount of data for each parse attempt (e.g., millions of bytes).\"\n\n### Impact\n\nA remote unauthenticated attacker may cause a SurrealDB server that exposes its WebSocket interface to consume high CPU by sending an HTTP request with a very long header to the WebSocket interface, potentially leading to denial of service.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Version 1.1.0 and later are not affected by this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers unable to update may be able to limit access to the WebSocket interface (i.e. the `/rpc` endpoint) via reverse proxy if not in use or only used by a limited number of trusted clients. Alternatively, a reverse proxy may be used to strip or truncate request headers exceeding a reasonable length before reaching the SurrealDB server.\n\n### References\n\n- #2807\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43669\n- https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0065.html\n- https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs/issues/376","affected":[{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.1.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/01/GHSA-58j9-j2fj-v8f4/GHSA-58j9-j2fj-v8f4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-58j9-j2fj-v8f4"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43669"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/snapview/tungstenite-rs/issues/376"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/pull/2807"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/87859158d3750b03564613de70b5ec4ae090549d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0065.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-01-19T20:31:21Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.641960Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-6698-mhxx-r84g","published":"2024-01-16T21:13:40Z","modified":"2024-01-19T19:28:25Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-22192"],"related":["CVE-2024-22192"],"summary":"Ursa CL-Signatures Revocation allows verifiers to generate unique identifiers for holders","details":"### Summary\n\nThe revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model.

The endianness issue affecting the `cpython` crate was fixed in recent versions of `pyo3`.\n\n[no longer actively maintained]: https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython/commit/e815555\n[cpython#265]: https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython/issues/265\n[cpython#294]: https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython/issues/294\n[`pyo3`]: https://crates.io/crates/pyo3","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cpython","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/cpython"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":null,"informational":"unmaintained","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2023-0076.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/cpython"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0076.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython/commit/e815555"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython/issues/265"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython/issues/294"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.713827Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-2rcp-jvr4-r259","published":"2023-10-20T15:18:52Z","modified":"2023-12-19T19:08:00Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-46115"],"related":["CVE-2023-46115"],"summary":"Tauri's Updater Private Keys Possibly Leaked via Vite Environment Variables","details":"### Impact\n\nThis advisory is not describing a vulnerability in the Tauri code base itself but a commonly used misconfiguration which could lead to leaking of the private key and updater key password into bundled Tauri applications using the Vite frontend in a specific configuration.\n\nThe Tauri documentation used an insecure example configuration in the [Vite guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/vite/) to showcase how to use Tauri together with Vite. \n\nCopying the following snippet `envPrefix: ['VITE_', 'TAURI_'],` from this guide into the `vite.config.ts` of a Tauri project possibly leads to bundling the `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD` into the Vite frontend code and therefore leaking this value to the debug built of a Tauri application.\n\nThe value is automatically bundled into debug builds but for production builds it is not embedded, as long as it is not directly referenced in the frontend code. Vite statically replaces these values in production builds. This reduces the amount of affected applications to a very small amount of affected applications.\n\nTo verify if you are affected you can search for the private key value or the `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` variable inside the release build frontend assets (`dist/`).\n\n> Example: `grep -r \"TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY\" dist/`\n\nUsing only the `envPrefix: ['VITE_'],` or any other framework than Vite means you are not impacted by this advisory.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe documentation has been patched but as the root cause is not in Tauri itself the issue is not fixed by updating Tauri.\nThe `vite.config.ts` configuration of the project needs to be adapted.\n\nWe recommend rotating your updater private key if you are affected by this (requires Tauri CLI >=1.5.5). After updating the envPrefix configuration, generate a new private key with `tauri signer generate`, saving the new private key and updating the updater's `pubkey` value on `tauri.conf.json` with the new public key. To update your existing application, the next application build must be signed with the older private key in order to be accepted by the existing application.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe `envPrefix: ['VITE_'],`should be used and the desired `TAURI` variables manually added.\nRespective these variables could be added `TAURI_PLATFORM`, `TAURI_ARCH`, `TAURI_FAMILY`, `TAURI_PLATFORM_VERSION`, `TAURI_PLATFORM_TYPE` and `TAURI_DEBUG` without leaking sensitive information.\n\nWe urge affected users to implement the workaround as the `1.x` branch will not receive a general prevention fix as it would break systems.\n\n### References\nThe issue was originally disclosed in our discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/616186924390023171/1164260301655523409).\nThe affected guide is [https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/vite/](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/vite/).\n\n\n> Update: We lowered the severity from high to low, as the likelihood of impact was found to only affect a **very limited** amount of applications.\n\n> Update2: We changed the affected versions to make clear that after `2.0.0-alpha.16` or `1.5.6` the potentially vulnerable recommendation was no longer visible on our website and should not affect projects by default.

This would lead to tables having `FULL` permissions for `SELECT`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` unless some other permissions were specified via the `PERMISSIONS` clause.\n\nWe have decided to treat this behaviour as a vulnerability due to its security implications, especially considering the lack of specific documentation and potential for confusion due to the `INFO FOR DB` statement previously not displaying default permissions.

Between calling `remove_dir_all(\"a\")` and remove_dir_all(\"a\")\nactually starting its work, the attacker can move 'p' to 'p-prime', and\nreplace 'p' with a symlink to '/'. Then the privileged process deletes 'p/etc'\nwhich is actually /etc, and now your system is broken. There are some\nmitigations for this exact scenario, such as CWD relative file lookup, but\nthey are not guaranteed - any code using absolute paths will not have that\nprotection in place.\n\nThe same attack could be performed at any point in the directory tree being\ndeleted: if 'a' contains a child directory called 'etc', attacking the\ndeletion by replacing 'a' with a link is possible.\n\nThe new code in this release mitigates the attack within the directory tree\nbeing deleted by using file-handle relative operations: to open 'a/etc', the\npath 'etc' relative to 'a' is opened, where 'a' is represented by a file\ndescriptor (Unix) or handle (Windows). With the exception of the entry points\ninto the directory deletion logic, this is robust against manipulation of the\ndirectory hierarchy, and remove_dir_all will only delete files and directories\ncontained in the tree it is deleting.\n\nThe entry path however is a challenge - as described above, there are some\npotential mitigations, but since using them must be done by the calling code,\nit is hard to be confident about the security properties of the path based\ninterface.\n\nThe new extension trait `RemoveDir` provides an interface where it is much\nharder to get it wrong.\n\n`somedir.remove_dir_contents(\"name-of-child\")`.\n\nCallers can then make their own security evaluation about how to securely get\na directory handle. That is still not particularly obvious, and we're going to\nfollow up with a helper of some sort (probably in the `fs_at` crate). Once\nthat is available, the path based entry points will get deprecated.\n\nIn the interim, processes that might run with elevated privileges should\nfigure out how to securely identify the directory they are going to delete, to\navoid the initial race.

Because the context can alternatively carry heap-allocated pointer freed on drop it was possible to \"deallocate\" a pointer that wasn't returned from appropriate allocator.

However, a recent addition to \nMiri checks that references passed to functions are valid during the \nentire execution of the function, even when those references are \npassed inside a struct. This poses an issue for dropping \nself-referencing values, as the reference becomes invalid during the \ndropping process. Effectively, since self-referencing structs are \nnot allowed in vanilla Rust, there is no allowance for dropping data\nduring a function that has also been given a reference to that data. \nThere's usually no way to pass a and &a to the same function.\n\nA fix was attempted, where the struct would be turned in to a raw \nbyte array and only transformed back into the underlying data type \ninside each function. This is allowable as a reference can be \ncreated and die over the body of a function, as long as the \nreference was created inside the function. However, this is also \nnot sound if the original struct contains padding. There is no \nway to initialize padding bytes to a known value that Miri will \naccept, so when it is cast to an array some of the bytes contain \nuninitialized values. This is not acceptable (despite the fact \nthat these bytes are never read) due to the potential for \noptimizations that may read from the uninitialized bytes. Besides \nwhich, this fix does not allow for template or constant parameters \nas there is no way to check the size of a templated type without \ngiving specific, concrete values for the template parameters.\n\nThe final solution was to use this fix while wrapping the raw byte\narray in `MaybeUninit<>`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ouroboros","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ouroboros"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.16.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":null,"informational":"unsound","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2023-0042.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/ouroboros"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0042.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/joshua-maros/ouroboros/issues/88"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.712291Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2020-0161","published":"2020-05-07T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:17:08.031225Z","aliases":["GHSA-83gg-pwxf-jr89"],"summary":"`array!` macro is unsound in presence of traits that implement methods it calls internally","details":"Affected versions of this crate called some methods using auto-ref.

As usernames are generally not limited by the characters they can contain, a username appearing to be a relative path can be constructed. For example we could add a user to the system containing the username ../../../../bin/cp. When logged in as a user with that name, that user could run sudo -K to clear their session record file. The session code then constructs the path to the session file by concatenating the username to the session file storage directory, resulting in a resolved path of /bin/cp. The code then clears that file, resulting in the cp binary effectively being removed from the system.\n\nAn attacker needs to be able to login as a user with a constructed username. Given that such a username is unlikely to exist on an existing system, they will also need to be able to create the users with the constructed usernames.\n\n## Patches\nThe bug is fixed in version 0.2.1 of sudo-rs.

It can be triggered when **all of the following conditions are met**:\n\n1. Running Apollo Router v1.28.0, v1.28.1 or v1.29.0 (\"impacted versions\"); **and**\n2. The Supergraph schema provided to the Router (either via Apollo Uplink or explicitly via other configuration) **has a `subscription` type** with root-fields defined; **and**\n3. The YAML configuration provided to the Router **has subscriptions enabled** (they are _disabled_ by default), either by setting `enabled: true` _or_ by setting a valid `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [subscriptions' documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup)); **and**\n4. An [anonymous](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Anonymous-Operation-Definitions) (i.e., un-named) `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`) is received by the Router\n\nIf **all four** of these criteria are met, the impacted versions will panic and terminate.  There is no data-privacy risk or sensitive-information exposure aspect to this vulnerability.\n\nDepending on the environment in which impacted versions are running and the high-availability characteristics of that environment, a single Router's termination may result in limited or reduced availability or other knock-on effects which are deployment-specific (e.g., depending on if there are multiple instances, auto-restart policies, etc.)\n\n### Discovery\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by an internal Apollo team.  We have no reports or evidence to support that that has been exploited outside of our own testing, research and follow-up.\n\nOur public security policy can be reviewed at https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/policy and we consider the security of our projects a top priority.  Please review the linked policy for more details.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is fixed in [Apollo Router v1.29.1](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.29.1), which is available on:\n\n- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) as `v1.29.1`\n- [GitHub Packages Container Registry](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/router) as `v1.29.1`\n- [Helm Chart Repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router/pkgs/container/helm-charts%2Frouter) as `1.29.1` (without the `v`)\n\nWe recommend all users running the impacted configuration above to update to a patched version of the Router immediately.  Router v1.29.1 should be a very simple upgrade from any impacted version. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpdating to v1.29.1 should be a clear and simple upgrade path for those running impacted versions.  However, if Subscriptions are **not** necessary for your Graph – but are enabled via configuration — then disabling subscriptions is another option to mitigate the risk.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [the `router` repository](https://github.com/apollographql/router)\n* Email us at `security` `[at]` `apollographql` `[dot]` `com`","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apollo-router","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/apollo-router"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.28.0"},{"fixed":"1.29.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.29.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/09/GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx/GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41317"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/b295c103dd86c57c848397d32e8094edfa8502aa"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.29.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-755"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-09-07T12:58:29Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-09-05T19:15:48Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.682801Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2023-0056","published":"2023-09-01T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:13:24.188980Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-41051","GHSA-49hh-fprx-m68g"],"summary":"Default functions in VolatileMemory trait lack bounds checks, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses","details":"An issue was discovered in the default implementations of the `VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut, get_ref, get_array_ref}` trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds memory access if the `VolatileMemory::get_slice` function returns a `VolatileSlice` whose length is less than the function’s `count` argument.

If the user downloaded a crate containing files writeable by any local user, another local user could exploit this to change the source code compiled and executed by the current user.\n\nThis vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-38497.\n\n## Overview\n\nIn UNIX-like systems, each file has three sets of permissions: for the user owning the file, for the group owning the file, and for all other local users. The \"[umask][1]\" is configured on most systems to limit those permissions during file creation, removing dangerous ones. For example, the default umask on macOS and most Linux distributions only allow the user owning a file to write to it, preventing the group owning it or other local users from doing the same.\n\nWhen a dependency is downloaded by Cargo, its source code has to be extracted on disk to allow the Rust compiler to read as part of the build. To improve performance, this extraction only happens the first time a dependency is used, caching the pre-extracted files for future invocations.\n\nUnfortunately, it was discovered that Cargo did not respect the umask during extraction, and propagated the permissions stored in the crate archive as-is. If an archive contained files writeable by any user on the system (and the system configuration didn't prevent writes through other security measures), another local user on the system could replace or tweak the source code of a dependency, potentially achieving code execution the next time the project is compiled.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\nAll Rust versions before 1.71.1 on UNIX-like systems (like macOS and Linux) are affected. Note that additional system-dependent security measures configured on the local system might prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.\n\nUsers on Windows and other non-UNIX-like systems are not affected.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nWe recommend all users to update to Rust 1.71.1, which will be released later today, as it fixes the vulnerability by respecting the umask when extracting crate archives.

vulnerable to incorrect decoding of storage value when using `DelegateCall`","details":"### Summary\nThe return value when using delegate call mechanics, either through [`CallBuilder::delegate`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/4.2.0/ink_env/call/struct.CallBuilder.html#method.delegate) or [`ink_env::invoke_contract_delegate`](https://docs.rs/ink_env/4.2.0/ink_env/fn.invoke_contract_delegate.html), is being decoded incorrectly.\n\n### Description\nConsider this minimal example:\n\n```rust\n// First contract, this will be performing a delegate call to the `Callee`.\n#[ink(storage)]\npub struct Caller {\n    value: u128,\n}\n\n#[ink(message)]\npub fn get_value(&self, callee_code_hash: Hash) -> u128 {\n    let result = build_call::<DefaultEnvironment>()\n        .delegate(callee_code_hash)\n        .exec_input(ExecutionInput::new(Selector::new(ink::selector_bytes!(\n            \"get_value\"\n        ))))\n        .returns::<u128>()\n        .invoke();\n\n    result\n}\n\n// Different contract, using this code hash for the delegate call.\n#[ink(storage)]\npub struct Callee {\n    value: u128,\n}\n\n#[ink(message)]\npub fn get_value(&self) -> u128 {\n    self.value\n}\n```\n\nIn this example we are executing the `Callee` code in the context of the `Caller` contract. This means we'll be using the storage values of the `Caller` contract.\n\nRunning this code we expect the delegate call to return `value` as it was stored in the `Caller` contract. However, due to the reported bug a different value is returned (for the case of `uint`s it is `256` times the expected value).\n\n### Impact\nAfter conducting an analysis of the on-chain deployments of ink! contracts on Astar, Shiden, Aleph Zero, Amplitude and Pendulum, we have found that no contracts on those chains have been affected by the issue.\n\nThis bug was related to the mechanics around decoding a call's return buffer, which was changed as part of https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/1450.

For example:\n\n```rust\nlet mut opts = ServerOptions::new();\nopts.pipe_mode(PipeMode::Message);\nopts.reject_remote_clients(true);\n```\n\n### References\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createnamedpipea#pipe_reject_remote_clients\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tokio","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tokio"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.7.0"},{"fixed":"1.18.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/01/GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7/GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tokio","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tokio"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.19.0"},{"fixed":"1.20.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/01/GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7/GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tokio","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tokio"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.21.0"},{"fixed":"1.23.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/01/GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7/GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/security/advisories/GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22466"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/5336"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/releases/tag/tokio-1.23.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createnamedpipea#pipe_reject_remote_clients"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0001.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-665"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-01-06T21:40:58Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-01-04T22:15:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.648829Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2023-0001","published":"2023-01-04T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:11:35.862060Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-22466","GHSA-7rrj-xr53-82p7"],"summary":"reject_remote_clients Configuration corruption","details":"On Windows, configuring a named pipe server with [pipe_mode] will force [ServerOptions]::[reject_remote_clients] as `false`.\n\nThis drops any intended explicit configuration for the [reject_remote_clients] that may have been set as `true` previously.\n\nThe default setting of [reject_remote_clients] is normally `true` meaning the default is also overridden as `false`.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nEnsure that [pipe_mode] is set first after initializing a [ServerOptions].

An attacker could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nThis vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2022-46176.\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen an SSH client establishes communication with a server, to prevent MITM attacks the client should check whether it already communicated with that server in the past and what the server's public key was back then. If the key changed since the last connection, the connection must be aborted as a MITM attack is likely taking place.\n\nIt was discovered that Cargo never implemented such checks, and performed no validation on the server's public key, leaving Cargo users vulnerable to MITM attacks.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\nAll Rust versions containing Cargo before 1.66.1 are vulnerable (prior to 0.67.1 for the crates.io package).\n\nNote that even if you don't explicitly use SSH for alternate registry indexes or crate dependencies, you might be affected by this vulnerability if you have configured git to replace HTTPS connections to GitHub with SSH (through git's [`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), as that'd cause you to clone the crates.io index through SSH.\n\n## Mitigations\n\nWe will be releasing Rust 1.66.1 today, 2023-01-10, changing Cargo to check the SSH host key and abort the connection if the server's public key is not already trusted. We recommend everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\nPatch files for Rust 1.66.0 are also available [here][2] for custom-built toolchains.\n\nFor the time being Cargo will not ask the user whether to trust a server's public key during the first connection. Instead, Cargo will show an error message detailing how to add that public key to the list of trusted keys. Note that this might break your automated builds if the hosts you clone dependencies or indexes from are not already trusted.\n\nIf you can't upgrade to Rust 1.66.1 yet, we recommend configuring Cargo to use the `git` CLI instead of its built-in git support. That way, all git network operations will be performed by the `git` CLI, which is not affected by this vulnerability. You can do so by adding this snippet to your [Cargo configuration file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html):\n\n```toml\n[net]\ngit-fetch-with-cli = true\n```\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThanks to the Julia Security Team for disclosing this to us according to our [security policy][3]!\n\nWe also want to thank the members of the Rust project who contributed to fixing this issue.

As `**` allows for sub directories the behavior there is also as expected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in the latest release and was backported into the currently supported 1.x branches.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround is known at the time of publication.\n\n### References\n\nThe original report contained information that the `dialog.open` component automatically allows one sub directory to be read, regardless of the `recursive` option.\n\nImagine a file system looking like\n```\n o ../\n o documents/\n    - file.txt\n    - deeper/\n       o deep_file.txt\n```\n\nReproduction steps:\n\n1.

Trying to load “deep_file.txt” also works, which isn’t expected\n\nThe recursive flag is used in https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/cd8c074ae6592303d3f6844a4fb6d262eae913b2/core/tauri/src/scope/fs.rs#L154 to scope the filesystem access to either files in the folder or to also include sub directories.\n\nThe original issue was replicated and further investigated.\n\nThe root cause was triaged to the `glob` crate facilitating defaults, which allow the `*` and `[...]` to also match path literals.\n\n```rust\nMatchOptions {\n    case_sensitive: true,\n    require_literal_separator: false,\n    require_literal_leading_dot: false\n}\n```\n\nThis implicated that not only the `dialog.open` component was affected but rather all `fs` scopes containing the `*` or `[...]` glob.\nDuring this investigation it became obvious that the current glob matches would also match hidden folder (e.g: `.ssh`) content by default, without explicitly allowing hidden folders to be matched. This is not commonly expected behavior in comparison to for example `bash`.\n\nThe new default  Match options are:\n\n```rust\nMatchOptions {\n    case_sensitive: true,\n    require_literal_separator: true,\n    require_literal_leading_dot: true\n}\n```\n\n> Another note security relevant for developers building applications interacting with case sensitive filesystems is, that the `case_sensitive` option only affects ASCII file paths and is not valid in Unicode based paths. This is considered a known risk until the `glob` crate supports non-ASCII file paths for this type of case sensitive matching.\n\n### For more Information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in tauri\nEmail us at [security@tauri.app](mailto:security@tauri.app)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tauri","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tauri"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"1.0.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/12/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tauri","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tauri"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.1.0"},{"fixed":"1.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/12/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tauri","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tauri"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.2.0"},{"fixed":"1.2.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/12/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tauri","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tauri"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"2.0.0-alpha.0"},{"fixed":"2.0.0-alpha.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/12/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46171"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/14d567f7ecb25a6d1024cf3d796f86aee89d0dd4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/72389b00d7b495ffd7750eb1e75a3b8537d07cf3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/f0602e7c294245ab6ef6fbf2a976ef398340ef58"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-12-22T20:03:43Z","nvd_published_at":"2022-12-23T14:15:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.645814Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx","published":"2022-12-05T17:58:16Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:10:54.980908Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-46149","RUSTSEC-2022-0068"],"summary":"Cap'n Proto and its Rust implementation vulnerable to out-of-bounds read due to logic error handling list-of-list","details":"The Cap'n Proto library and capnp Rust package are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read due to logic error handling list-of-list.

This details below focus only on determining whether an application is vulnerable.\n\nIn order to be vulnerable, an application must have certain properties.\n\nFirst, the application must accept messages with a schema in which a field has list-of-pointer type. This includes `List(Text)`, `List(Data)`, `List(List(T))`, or `List(C)` where `C` is an interface type. In the following discussion, we will assume this field is named `foo`.\n\nSecond, the application must accept a message of this schema from a malicious source, where the attacker can maliciously encode the pointer representing the field `foo`.\n\nThird, the application must call `getFoo()` to obtain a `List<T>::Reader` for the field, and then use it in one of the following two ways:\n\n1. Pass it as the parameter to another message's `setFoo()`, thus copying the field into a new message. Note that copying the parent struct as a whole will *not* trigger the bug; the bug only occurs if the specific field `foo` is get/set on its own.\n\n2. Convert it into `AnyList::Reader`, and then attempt to access it through that. This is much less likely; very few apps use the `AnyList` API.\n\nThe dynamic API equivalents of these actions (`capnp/dynamic.h`) are also affected.\n\nIf the application does these steps, the attacker may be able to cause the Cap'n Proto implementation to read beyond the end of the message. This could induce a segmentation fault. Or, worse, data that happened to be in memory immediately after the message might be returned as if it were part of the message. In the latter case, if the application then forwards that data back to the attacker or sends it to another third party, this could result in exfiltration of secrets.\n\nAny exfiltration of data would have the following limitations:\n\n* The attacker could exfiltrate no more than 512 KiB of memory immediately following the message buffer.\n  * The attacker chooses in advance how far past the end of the message to read.\n  * The attacker's message itself must be larger than the exfiltrated data. Note that a sufficiently large message buffer will likely be allocated using mmap() in which case the attack will likely segfault.\n* The attack can only work if the 8 bytes immediately following the exfiltrated data contains a valid in-bounds Cap'n Proto pointer. The easiest way to achieve this is if the pointer is null, i.e. 8 bytes of zero.\n  * The attacker must specify exactly how much data to exfiltrate, so must guess exactly where such a valid pointer will exist.\n  * If the exfiltrated data is not followed by a valid pointer, the attack will throw an exception. If an application has chosen to ignore exceptions (e.g. by compiling with `-fno-exceptions` and not registering an alternative exception callback) then the attack may be able to proceed anyway.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"capnp","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/capnp"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.15.0"},{"fixed":"0.15.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/12/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"capnp","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/capnp"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.14.0"},{"fixed":"0.14.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/12/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"capnp","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/capnp"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.13.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/12/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/security/advisories/GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46149"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/commit/25d34c67863fd960af34fc4f82a7ca3362ee74b9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://dwrensha.github.io/capnproto-rust/2022/11/30/out_of_bounds_memory_access_bug.html"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/tree/master/security-advisories/2022-11-30-0-pointer-list-bounds.md"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EAHKLUMJAXJEV5BPBS5XXWBQ3ZTHGOLY"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PTS6TWD6K2NKXLEEFBPROQXMOFUTEYWY"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WKXM4JAFXLTXU5IQB3OUBQVCIICZWGYX"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZOCQQOPMVQOFUWBWAGVGN76OYAV3WXY4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0068.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-125"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-12-05T17:58:16Z","nvd_published_at":"2022-11-30T17:15:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.675548Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2022-0068","published":"2022-11-30T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:10:54.980908Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-46149","GHSA-qqff-4vw4-f6hx"],"summary":"out-of-bounds

This means the issue by itself can not be abused and requires further intentional or unintentional privileges.\n\n### Workaround\n\nDisable the `dialog` and `fileDropEnabled` component inside the `tauri.conf.json`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been resolved in #5237 and the implementation now properly escapes the special characters. The patch has been included in releases: `1.0.7`, `1.1.2` and `1.2.0`\n\n### For more information\n\nThis issue was initially reported by MessyComposer in #5234.\n\nIf you have any questions or

Who is impacted?_\n\nThis vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method.\n\n### Initialization Functions\n\nThe heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to **_out-of-bound writes_** when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations.\n\n### `Heap::extend`\n\nThis vulnerability impacts three specific uses of the `Heap::extend` method:\n\n- When calling `Heap::extend` with a size smaller than two `usize`s (e.g., 16 on `x86_64`), the size was erroneously rounded up to the minimum size, which could result in an **_out-of-bounds write_**.\n- Calling `Heap::extend` on an empty heap tried to construct a heap starting at address 0, which is also an **_out-of-bounds write_**.\n  - One specific way to trigger this accidentally is to call `Heap::new` (or a similar constructor) with a heap size that is smaller than two `usize`s. This was treated as an empty heap as well.\n- Calling `Heap::extend` on a heap whose size is not a multiple of the size of two `usize`s resulted in _unaligned writes_. It also left the heap in an unexpected state, which might lead to subsequent issues. We did not find a way to exploit this undefined behavior yet (apart from DoS on platforms that fault on unaligned writes).\n\n## Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nWe published a patch in version `0.10.2` and recommend all users to upgrade to it. This patch release includes the following changes:\n\n- The initialization functions now panic if the given size is not large enough to store the necessary metadata. Depending on the alignment of the heap bottom pointer, the minimum size is between `2 * size_of::<usize>` and `3 * size_of::<usize>`.\n- The `extend` method now panics when trying to extend an unitialized heap.\n- Extend calls with a size smaller than `size_of::<usize>() * 2` are now buffered internally and not added to the list directly. The buffered region will be merged with future `extend` calls.\n- The `size()` method now returns the _usable_ size of the heap, which might be slightly smaller than the `top() - bottom()` difference because of alignment constraints.\n\n## Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nTo avoid this issue, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in this repository\n* Email @phil-opp at [security@phil-opp.com](mailto:security@phil-opp.com)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis issue was responsibly reported by Evan Richter at ForAllSecure and found with [Mayhem](https://forallsecure.com/mayhem-for-code) and [cargo fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"linked_list_allocator","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/linked_list_allocator"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.10.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/09/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36086"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/013b0758643943e8df5b17bbb495460ff47e8bbf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0063.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-119","CWE-1284"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-09-16T17:41:33Z","nvd_published_at":"2022-09-07T23:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.686203Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2022-0063","published":"2022-09-07T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:10:00.309199Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-36086","GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j"],"summary":"Multiple vulnerabilities resulting in out-of-bounds writes","details":"* The heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument.

DoS vulnerability from lack of resource management","details":"### Impact\n\nAn attacker node can cause a victim node to allocate a large number of small memory chunks, which can ultimately lead to the victim’s process running out of memory and thus getting killed by its operating system. When executed continuously, this can lead to a denial of service attack, especially relevant on a larger scale when run against more than one node of a libp2p based network.\n\n### Details\n\nIn the original version of the attack, the malicious node would continuously open new streams on a single connection using a stream multiplexer that doesn’t provide sufficient back pressure (mplex or yamux). While allocations per stream might be considered small, they multiply with the number of streams and connections. It is easy to defend against this one attack, e.g. by setting a strict per connection stream limit and connection limit. But there are other variations of this attack, e.g. causing memory allocations by sending partial payloads on various protocol levels, forcing the victim to buffer the partial payload for a period of time or by tricking the victim into pre-allocating buffers for messages which are never sent by the attacker.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to `libp2p` `v0.45.1` or above.\n\n### References\nPlease see our DoS Mitigation page for more information on how to incorporate mitigation strategies, monitor your application, and respond to attacks: https://docs.libp2p.io/reference/dos-mitigation/.\n\nPlease see the related disclosure for go-libp2p: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-j7qp-mfxf-8xjw and js-libp2p: https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-f44q-634c-jvwv\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at security@libp2p.io.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libp2p","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/libp2p"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.45.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.45.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/12/GHSA-jvgw-gccv-q5p8/GHSA-jvgw-gccv-q5p8.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-j7qp-mfxf-8xjw"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-f44q-634c-jvwv"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-jvgw-gccv-q5p8"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23486"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0084.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-770"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-12-07T20:28:46Z","nvd_published_at":"2022-12-07T21:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.668011Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2022-0084","published":"2022-07-12T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:08:18.938960Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-23486","GHSA-jvgw-gccv-q5p8"],"summary":"libp2p Lack of resource management DoS","details":"libp2p allows a potential attacker to cause victim p2p node to run out of memory\n\nThe out of memory failure can cause crashes where libp2p is intended to be used\nwithin large scale networks leading to potential Denial of Service (DoS) vector\n\nUsers should upgrade or reference the [DoS mitigation strategies](https://docs.libp2p.io/reference/dos-mitigation/).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"libp2p","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/libp2p"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.45.1"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["denial-of-service"],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2022-0084.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/libp2p"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0084.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-jvgw-gccv-q5p8"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.709632Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-9qmm-4mfr-r3wj","published":"2022-05-10T00:00:21Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:08:16.094652Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-23066"],"summary":"Incorrect Calculation in solana_rbpf","details":"In Solana rBPF versions 0.2.26 and 0.2.27 are affected by Incorrect Calculation which is caused by improper implementation of sdiv instruction.

They are both valid. But when generating the block template, if the fee rate of B is higher, it comes before A, which will invalidate A. Currently the RPC get_block_template will fail instead of dropping A.\n\n## Patch\n\nFirst, the get_block_template should not fail but dropping the conflict transactions.\n\nThen we can propose solution to this issue. Here is an example. When a transaction is added to the pool, the pool must consider it depending on all the transactions which dep cell (direct or indirect via dep group) has been destroyed in this transaction. Because future transactions using the destroyed cells as dep will be rejected, the spending transaction only need to wait for all the existing dep transactions on chain.\n\n## Workaround\n\n    Submit transaction B when A is already on chain.\n    Let B depend on A explicitly, there are several solutions:\n        a. Add any output cell on A as a dep cell or input in B.\n        b. Merge A and B. CKB allows using the same cell as both dep and input in the same transaction.\n    Ensure the fee rate of B is less than A so A always has higher priority.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ckb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ckb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.40.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":[],"cvss":null,"informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2021-0107.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/ckb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0107.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/security/advisories/GHSA-v666-6w97-pcwm"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.703392Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-6p3c-v8vc-c244","published":"2022-01-06T22:10:34Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:07:22.503158Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-45697","GHSA-82hm-vh7g-hrh9","RUSTSEC-2021-0103"],"summary":"The `total_size` function for partial read the length of any `FixVec` is incorrect in molecule.","details":"Anyone who uses total_size(..) function to partial read the length of any FixVec will get an incorrect result, due to an incorrect implementation.

This bug was introduced early in the development of Lucet and is present in all releases.  As a result of this bug, and dependent on the memory backing for the `Instance` objects, it is possible to trigger a use-after-free when the `Instance` is dropped.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to the `main` branch of the Lucet repository. Lucet does not provide versioned releases on crates.io.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no way to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading.\n\n### Description\nLucet uses a \"pool\" allocator for new WebAssembly instances that are created. This pool allocator manages everything from the linear memory of the wasm instance, the runtime stack for async switching, as well as the memory behind the Instance itself. `Instances` are referred to via an `InstanceHandle` type which will, on drop, release the memory backing the Instance back to the pool.\n\nWhen an Instance is dropped, the fields of the `Instance` are destructed top-to-bottom, however when the `alloc: Alloc` field is destructed, the memory backing the `Instance` is released back to the pool before the destructors of the remaining fields are run. If another thread allocates the same memory from the pool while these destructors are still running, a race condition occurs that can lead to use-after-free errors.\n\nThe bug was corrected by changing how the `InstanceHandle` destructor operates to ensure that the memory backing an Instance is only returned to the pool once the `Instance` has been completely destroyed.\n\nThis security advisory has been assigned CVE-2021-43790.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [lucet repository](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet)\n* Email [the lucet team](mailto:lucet@fastly.com)\n* See the [Bytecode Alliance security policy](https://bytecodealliance.org/security)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"lucet-runtime","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/lucet-runtime"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.6.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/11/GHSA-hf79-8hjp-rrvq/GHSA-hf79-8hjp-rrvq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet/security/advisories/GHSA-hf79-8hjp-rrvq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43790"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet/commit/7c7757c772fb709c61b1442bcc1e1fbee97bf4a8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://crates.io/crates/lucet-runtime"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/lucet"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-11-30T20:56:59Z","nvd_published_at":"2021-11-30T00:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.664045Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-h352-g5vw-3926","published":"2021-11-16T17:26:47Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:07:11.140379Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-43620","RUSTSEC-2021-0123"],"summary":"Improper Input Validation in fruity","details":"Methods of NSString for conversion to a string may return a partial result.

And these memory regions can be accessed by retrieving the `state`, e.g. send it over TCP or HTTP. This requires the Tremor server (or any other program using tremor-script) to execute a tremor-script script that uses the mentioned language construct.\n\n#### Details\n\nIf affects the following two tremor-script language constructs:\n\n* A [Merge](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#merge) where we assign the result back to the target expression\n  and the expression to be merged needs to reference the `event`:\n\n```\nlet state = merge state of event end;\n```\n\n* A [Patch](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#patch) where we assign the result back to the target expression\n  and the patch operations used need to reference the `event`:\n\n```\nlet state = patch state of insert event.key => event.value end;\n```\n\nFor constructs like this (it does not matter what it references in the expression to be merged or the patch operations) an optimization\nwas applied to manipulate the target value in-place, instead of cloning it.\n\nOur `Value` struct, which underpins all event data in `tremor-script`, is representing strings as borrowed `beef::Cow<'lifetime, str>`, \nthat reference the raw data `Vec<u8>` the event is based upon. We keep this raw byte-array next to the `Value` structure inside our `Event` as a self-referential struct,\nso we make sure that the structured `Value` and its references are valid across its whole lifetime.\n\nThe optimization was considered safe as long as it was only possible to merge or patch `event` data or static data.\nWhen `state` was introduced to `tremor-script` (in version 0.7.3) a new possibility to keep `Value` data around for longer than the lifetime of an event emerged.\nIf `event` data is merged or patched into `state` without cloning it first, it can still reference keys or values from\nthe previous event, which will now be invalid. This allows access to those already freed regions of memory and to get their content out over the wire.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in https://crates.io/crates/tremor-script/0.11.6 and https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/releases/tag/v0.11.6 via commit [1a2efcd](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/commit/1a2efcdbe68e5e7fd0a05836ac32d2cde78a0b2e) by removing the optimization\nand always clone the target expression of a [Merge](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#merge) or [Patch](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/tremor-script/index#patch.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf an upgrade is not possible, a possible workaround is to avoid the optimization\nby introducing a temporary variable and not immediately reassigning to `state`:\n\n```\nlet tmp = merge state of event end;\nlet state = tmp\n```\n\n### References\n\nThe actual fix is applied in this PR: https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/pull/1217\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue on our repository [tremor-rs/tremor-runtime](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime)\n* Please join our discord https://chat.tremor.rs and reach out to the team.\n\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"tremor-script","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tremor-script"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.7.3"},{"fixed":"0.11.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/09/GHSA-mc22-5q92-8v85/GHSA-mc22-5q92-8v85.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/security/advisories/GHSA-mc22-5q92-8v85"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39228"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/pull/1217"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/commit/1a2efcdbe68e5e7fd0a05836ac32d2cde78a0b2e"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/releases/tag/v0.11.6"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416","CWE-825"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-09-17T17:50:18Z","nvd_published_at":"2021-09-17T14:15:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.669930Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-862g-9h5m-m3qv","published":"2021-11-08T18:01:13Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:06:32.214668Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-3917"],"summary":"coreos-installer < 0.10.0 writes world-readable Ignition config to installed system","details":"### Impact\nOn systems installed with coreos-installer before 0.10.0, the user-provided Ignition config was written to `/boot/ignition/config.ign` with world-readable permissions, granting unprivileged users access to any secrets included in the config.\n\nDefault configurations of Fedora CoreOS and RHEL CoreOS do not include any unprivileged user accounts.

This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn't parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\".\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nThe flaw exists in all prior versions of hyper, if built with [`rustc` v1.5.0 or newer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/28826/commits/123a83326fb95366e94a3be1a74775df4db97739).\n\nExample:\n\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Length: +3\n\nabc\n```\n\nThis request gets accepted and hyper reads the body as abc. The request _should_ be rejected, according to RFC 7230, since the ABNF for `Content-Length` only allows for `DIGIT`s. This is due to using the `FromStr` implementation for `u64` in the standard library. By differing from the spec, it is possible to send requests like these to endpoints that have different HTTP implementations, with different interpretations of the payload semantics, and cause \"desync attacks\".\n\nIn this particular case, an upstream proxy would need to error when parsing the `Content-Length`, but _not_ reject the request (swallowing its own error), and forwarding the request as-is with the `Content-Length` still included. _Then_ the upstream proxy and hyper would disagree on the length of the request body. The combination of these factors would be extremely rare.\n\nRead more about desync attacks: https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn\n\n### Impact\n\nTo determine if vulnerable, all these things must be true:\n\n- **Using hyper as an HTTP server**. While the lenient decoder also exists in the client, a vulnerability does not exist around _responses_.\n- **Using HTTP/1**. The HTTP/2 code uses a stricter parser.\n- **Using a vulnerable HTTP proxy upstream to hyper**. If an upstream proxy correctly rejects the illegal `Content-Length` header, *OR* can parse the length with the plus sign, the desync attack cannot succeed.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe have released the following patch versions:\n\n- v0.14.10 (to be released when this advisor is published)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nBesides upgrading hyper, you can take the following options:\n\n- Reject requests manually that contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length` header.\n- Ensure any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign prefix.\n\n### Credits\nThis issue was initially reported by [Mattias Grenfeldt](https://grenfeldt.dev/) and Asta Olofsson.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hyper","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hyper"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.14.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/07/GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c/GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/security/advisories/GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32715"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/28826/commits/123a83326fb95366e94a3be1a74775df4db97739"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/1fb719e0b61a4f3d911562a436a2ff05fd7cb759"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0078.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-444"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-07-07T20:08:46Z","nvd_published_at":"2021-07-07T20:15:00Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.658042Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2021-0078","published":"2021-07-07T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:05:57.978700Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-32715","GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c"],"summary":"Lenient `hyper` header parsing of `Content-Length` could allow request smuggling","details":"`hyper`'s HTTP header parser accepted, according to RFC 7230, illegal contents inside `Content-Length` headers.\nDue to this, upstream HTTP proxies that ignore the header may still forward them along if it chooses to ignore the error.\n\nTo be vulnerable, `hyper` must be used as an HTTP/1 server and using an HTTP proxy upstream that ignores the header's contents\nbut still forwards it.

Additionally, an HTTP request smuggling vulnerability would occur if using a proxy which instead has prefix truncation in the chunk size, or that understands larger than 64-bit chunk sizes.\n\nRead more about desync attacks: https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn\n\n### Impact\n\nTo determine if vulnerable to _data loss_, these things must be true:\n\n- **Using HTTP/1.1.** Since HTTP/2 does not use chunked encoding, it is not vulnerable.\n- **Using hyper as a server or client.** The body would be improperly truncated in either case.\n- **Users send requests or responses with chunk sizes greater than 18 exabytes**.\n\nTo determine if vulnerable to _desync attacks_, these things must be true:\n\n- **Using an upstream proxy that allows chunks sizes larger than 64-bit.** If the proxy rejects chunk sizes that are too large, that request won't be forwarded to hyper.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe have released the following patch versions:\n\n - v0.14.10 (to be released when this advisory is published)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nBesides upgrading hyper, you can take the following options:\n\n- Reject requests manually that contain a `Transfer-Encoding` header.\n- Ensure any upstream proxy rejects `Transfer-Encoding` chunk sizes greater than what fits in 64-bit unsigned integers.\n\n\n### Credits\nThis issue was initially reported by [Mattias Grenfeldt](https://grenfeldt.dev/) and Asta Olofsson.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hyper","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hyper"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.14.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/07/GHSA-5h46-h7hh-c6x9/GHSA-5h46-h7hh-c6x9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/security/advisories/GHSA-5h46-h7hh-c6x9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32714"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0079.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-190"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-07-07T20:05:15Z","nvd_published_at":"2021-07-07T20:15:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.642331Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2021-0079","published":"2021-07-07T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:05:57.916759Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-32714","GHSA-5h46-h7hh-c6x9"],"summary":"Integer overflow in `hyper`'s parsing of the `Transfer-Encoding` header leads to data loss","details":"When decoding chunk sizes that are too large, `hyper`'s code would encounter an integer overflow.

In Deno 1.5.x and 1.6.x only programs dynamically importing (especially transitively) untrusted code are affected. In Deno 1.7.x all programs importing (especially transitively) untrusted code are affected.\n\nIn effect an attacker in control of a (possibly remote) module in a programs module graph has been able to, **irrespective of permissions**:\n1. initiate GET requests to arbitrary URLs on the internet (including LAN) and possibly read (parts of) the contents of these resources.\n2. check for existence of arbitrary paths on the file system, and possibly read (parts of) the contents of these files.\n\nIn Deno 1.5.x (October 27th, 2020) and Deno 1.6.x (December 8th, 2020) the attacker module had to have been granted permissions to load dynamically through the network / fs read permission. Since Deno 1.7.x (January 19th, 2021) this vulnerability was able to be exploited in a fully sandboxed isolate (without any permissions). This vulnerability was not present in releases prior to 1.5.0.\n\nArbitrary non-GET requests, control over request headers, or file system writes are not possible through this vulnerability. Users of the `deno_core`, `deno_runtime`, or other `deno_*` crates are not affected. This is a Deno CLI only vulnerability.\n\nWe are relatively confident this was not abused in the wild, as by default Deno prints out a green \"Download\" message when remote imports are downloaded, and this would have caused suspicion if it occurred in the middle of a programs execution. This message can be silenced with the `--quiet` flag.  \n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Deno release 1.10.2. You can upgrade to the latest Deno version by running the `deno upgrade` command. The release is available through all official download channels. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround for this issue.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/denoland/deno)\n* Discuss on [Discord](https://discord.gg/deno)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.5.0"},{"fixed":"1.10.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.10.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/09/GHSA-xpwj-7v8q-mcgj/GHSA-xpwj-7v8q-mcgj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-xpwj-7v8q-mcgj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32619"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-285","CWE-863"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-09-23T21:13:15Z","nvd_published_at":"2021-05-28T21:15:00Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.687120Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-jh37-772x-4hpw","published":"2021-08-25T21:01:52Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:05:51.884944Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-31996","RUSTSEC-2021-0053"],"summary":"Double free in algorithmica","details":"An issue was discovered in the algorithmica crate through 2021-03-07 for Rust.

may run arbitrary executables on Windows","details":"On Windows in versions of `grep-cli` prior to `0.1.6`, it's possible for some\nof the routines to execute arbitrary executables. In particular, a quirk of\nthe Windows process execution API is that it will automatically consider the\ncurrent directory before other directories when resolving relative binary\nnames. Therefore, if you use `grep-cli` to read decompressed files in an\nuntrusted directory with that directory as the CWD, a malicious actor to could\nput, e.g., a `gz.exe` binary in that directory and `grep-cli` will use the\nmalicious actor's version of `gz.exe` instead of the system's.\n\nThis is also technically possible on Unix as well, but only if the `PATH`\nvariable contains `.`. Conventionally, they do not.\n\nA `DecompressionReader` has been fixed to automatically resolve binary names\nusing `PATH`, instead of relying on the Windows API to do it.\n\nIf you use `grep-cli`'s `CommandReader` with a `std::process::Command` value\non Windows, then it is recommended to either construct the `Command` with an\nabsolute binary name, or use `grep-cli`'s new\n[`resolve_binary`](https://docs.rs/grep-cli/0.1.6/grep_cli/fn.resolve_binary.html)\nhelper function.\n\nTo be clear, `grep-cli 0.1.6` mitigates this issue in two ways:\n\n* A `DecompressionReader` will resolve decompression programs to absolute\npaths automatically using the `PATH` environment variable, instead of relying\non Windows APIs to do it (which would result in the undesirable behavior of\nchecking the CWD for a program first).\n* A new function, `resolve_binary`, was added to help users of this crate\nmitigate this behavior when they need to create their own\n`std::process::Command`. For example,\n[ripgrep uses `grep_cli::resolve_binary`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/7ce66f73cf7e76e9f2557922ac8e650eb02cf4ed/crates/core/search.rs#L119-L122)\non the argument given to its `--pre` flag.\n\nWhile the first mitigation fixes this issue for sensible values of `PATH`\nwhen doing decompression search, the second mitigation is imperfect. The more\nfundamental issue is that `std::process::Command` is itself vulnerable to this.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"grep-cli","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/grep-cli"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.1.6"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":["grep_cli::DecompressionReader::new"],"os":["windows"]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["code-execution"],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2021-0071.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/grep-cli"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0071.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1773"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.701792Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3h87-v52r-p9rg","published":"2021-08-25T20:54:08Z","modified":"2023-11-08T04:05:44.188314Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-29941","CVE-2021-29942","GHSA-jpwg-6gf5-5vh9","RUSTSEC-2021-0050"],"summary":"Out of bounds write in reorder","details":"swap_index takes an iterator and swaps the items with their corresponding indexes.

This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that understands the request payload boundary differently can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\".\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nThe flaw was introduced in https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/26417fc24a7d05df538e0f39239b373c5c3d61f6, released in v0.12.0.\n\nConsider this example request:\n\n```\nPOST /yolo HTTP/1.1\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nTransfer-Encoding: cow\n```\n\nThis request *should* be rejected, according to RFC 7230, since it has a `Transfer-Encoding` header, but after folding, it does not end in `chunked`. hyper would notice the `chunked` in the first line, and then check the second line, and thanks to a missing boolean assignment, *not* set the error condition. hyper would treat the payload as being `chunked`. By differing from the spec, it is possible to send requests like these to endpoints that have different HTTP implementations, with different interpretations of the payload semantics, and cause \"desync attacks\".\n\nThere are several parts of the spec that must also be checked, and hyper correctly handles all of those. Additionally, hyper's *client* does not allow sending requests with improper headers, so the misunderstanding cannot be propagated further.\n\nRead more about desync attacks: https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn\n\n### Impact\n\nTo determine if vulnerable, all these things must be true:\n\n- **Using hyper as an HTTP *server*.** The client is not affected.\n- **Using HTTP/1.1.** HTTP/2 does not use `transfer-encoding`.\n- **Using a vulnerable HTTP proxy upstream to hyper.** If an upstream proxy correctly rejects the illegal transfer-encoding headers, the desync attack cannot succeed.

This allows bypass of signature verification in cases where coreos-installer decompresses a downloaded OS image, allowing an attacker who can modify the OS image to compromise a newly-installed system.\n\nDefault installations from ISO or PXE media in Fedora CoreOS, RHEL CoreOS, and RHEL for Edge are **not** affected, as coreos-installer installs from an OS image shipped as part of the install media.\n\nThese flows are affected:\n\n1.  Installing with `--image-file`, `--image-url`, or `coreos.inst.image_url`.  For example, if a user has a local mirror of installation images, an attacker could replace an image with a gzip-compressed alternative (even if the file extension is `.xz`).  The result:\n\n    ```\n    $ coreos-installer install --image-url http://localhost:8080/image.xz /dev/loop0\n    Downloading image from http://localhost:8080/image.xz\n    Downloading signature from http://localhost:8080/image.xz.sig\n    > Read disk 749.9 MiB/749.9 MiB (100%)\n    gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Sep 2021 02:41:50 PM EDT\n    gpg: using RSA key 8C5BA6990BDB26E19F2A1A801161AE6945719A39\n    gpg: BAD signature from \"Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>\" [ultimate]\n    Install complete.\n    ```\n\n    Notice that GPG reports a bad signature, but coreos-installer continues anyway.  Automation that relies on coreos-installer's exit status will not notice either.\n\n2. `coreos-installer download --decompress --image-url`:\n\n    ```\n    $ coreos-installer download --decompress --image-url http://localhost:8080/image.xz\n    > Read disk 749.9 MiB/749.9 MiB (100%)\n    gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Sep 2021 02:41:50 PM EDT\n    gpg: using RSA key 8C5BA6990BDB26E19F2A1A801161AE6945719A39\n    gpg: BAD signature from \"Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>\" [ultimate]\n    ./image\n    ```\n\n    Again, coreos-installer reports success.\n\n3. Installing with default parameters, when **not** installing from the image built into live ISO or PXE media, if the hosting service is compromised or if an active attacker gains control of the HTTPS response.\n\n4. `coreos-installer download --decompress` if the hosting service is compromised or if an active attacker gains control of the HTTPS response.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability is [fixed](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/pull/659) in coreos-installer 0.10.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor `coreos-installer download`, do not use the `-d` or `--decompress` options.\n\nFor `coreos-installer install`, manually inspect the stderr output.  If `BAD signature` appears, do not boot from the target disk.  Note, however, that some OS services may have already accessed data on the compromised disk.\n\n### References\n\nFor more information, see [PR

There are `old_size` number of bytes in\nthe old allocation, but we were accidentally copying `new_size` number of bytes,\nwhich could lead to copying bytes into the realloc'd space from past the chunk\nthat we're bump allocating out of, from unknown memory.\n\nIf an attacker can cause `realloc`s, and can read the `realoc`ed data back,\nthis could allow them to read things from other regions of memory that they\nshouldn't be able to. For example, if some crypto keys happened to live in\nmemory right after a chunk we were bump allocating out of, this could allow\nthe attacker to read the crypto keys.\n\nBeyond just fixing the bug and adding a regression test, I've also taken two\nadditional steps:\n\n1. While we were already running the testsuite under `valgrind` in CI, because\n   `valgrind` exits with the same code that the program did, if there are\n   invalid reads/writes that happen not to trigger a segfault, the program can\n   still exit OK and we will be none the wiser. I've enabled the\n   `--error-exitcode=1` flag for `valgrind` in CI so that tests eagerly fail\n   in these scenarios.\n\n2. I've written a quickcheck test to exercise `realloc`. Without the bug fix\n   in this patch, this quickcheck immediately triggers invalid reads when run\n   under `valgrind`.

Rust package suppresses ssh host key checking","details":"By default, when accessing an ssh repository\n(ie via an `ssh:` git repository url)\nthe git2 Rust package does not do any host key checking.\n\nAdditionally,\nthe provided API is not sufficient for a an application\nto do meaningful checking itself.\n\n## Impact\n\nWhen connecting to an ssh repository,\nand when an attacker can redirect the connection\n(performing a malice-in-the-middle attack)\nan affected application might:\n\n * Receive git objects and branches controlled by the attacker,\n   exposing the local system (and whatever happens next)\n   to malicious data.\n   In many circumstances,\n   this could readily lead to privilege escalation.\n\n * Erroneously send git objects to the attacker,\n   rather than to the intended recipient.\n   If the information is not supposed to be public,\n   this would constitute an information leak.\n   Also, since the data doesn't arrive where intended,\n   it constitutes a denial of service.\n\n## Technical details\n\nThe `git2` Rust package (henceforth, git2-rs)\nunconditionally calls the underlying C `libgit2` functions to set\nan ssh certificate check callback.\nThe Rust package uses this to offer\nthe ability for the application to set a callback to a Rust function.\n\nThe C-level callback function provided by git2-rs 0.15.0 and earlier:\n\n * Always ignores the `is_valid` argument provided by `libgit2`,\n   which indicates whether `libgit2` considers the host key valid\n\n * By default, performs no checks, and then\n   returns code `0`,\n   indicating to `libgit2` to override `libgit2`'s determination\n   and treat the host key as valid.\n\n * Provides only limited APIs to the application\n   for examining the supplied host key,\n   and doesn't tell the application\n   whether `libgit2`'s checks succeeded,\n   so it is difficult for the application cannot work around the problem.\n\n## Resolution\n\nUpgrade to git2-rs 0.16.x.\n\nThe default behaviour in 0.16.x is to\nhonour `libgit2`'s validity determination.\n\nNote that adding this previously skipped check\nmay cause existing setups to stop working.\n\n## Relationship to CVE-2022-46176\n\nThis bug manifested in cargo where it was assigned CVE-2022-46176.\n\nThe same bug exists in other applications which use\naffected versions of git2-rs\nunless they never try to access git repositories with `ssh:` urls.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"git2","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/git2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"0.16.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["crypto-failure"],"cvss":null,"informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2023-0002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/git2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0002.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/pull/909"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/01/10/cve-2022-46176.html"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-05T12:29:47.710494Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2022-0077","published":"2022-12-04T12:00:00Z","modified":"2023-02-04T10:58:43Z","summary":"`claim`
