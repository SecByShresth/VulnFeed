Prior to v4.0.0, the validation that this `chip_ordering` correctly provides these indexes was missing. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by adding a check that the indexed chip’s name is equal to the name stored in the verifying key’s chip information. \n\nIn the recursive verifier, every verifier program is generated beforehand and later checked for correctness by requiring a merkle proof to the precomputed merkle root of valid verifier keys. Therefore, the recursive verifier and the on-chain verifier were not affected by this vulnerability. \n\nThis code was audited twice, once as a part of the audit by KALOS and once by Cantina for v1.0.0. This bug was found by the Succinct team during preparation of v4.0.0. Out of abundance of caution, we will be deprecating all previous versions and freeze the corresponding verifiers.\n\nFurthermore, in the recursive verifier, the `is_complete` boolean flag is used to flag a proof of complete execution. Prior to v4.0.0, this flag was underconstrained in parts of our recursive verifier, such as the first layer of the recursion. In v4.0.0, this bug was fixed by adding appropriate calls to the `assert_complete` function, which constrains the correctness of the `is_complete` flag. This code was a part of the audit for v3.0.0. This bug affects the soundness of the Rust SDK for verifying compressed proofs, and the soundness of on-chain verifier for deferred proofs. \n\nThis issue was found by a combined effort from Aligned, LambdaClass and 3MI Labs, and was also independently found by Succinct during the preparation of v4.0.0. \n\nLastly, SP1’s STARK verifier relied on logic inside Plonky3, one SP1's core dependencies, to check that the polynomial evaluation claims are correct using a FRI-based polynomial commitment scheme. To batch this check, multiple polynomial evaluation claims are combined using a random linear combination. Prior to v4.0.0, the individual evaluation claims were not observed into the challenger before sampling the coefficient for the random linear combination. In v4.0.0, this was fixed by observing all the evaluation claims into the challenger correctly inside of Plonky3.\n\nThis bug was found by Lev Soukhanov and Onur Kilic, and we have worked closely with the Plonky3 team to mitigate this vulnerability. We will be deprecating all previous versions and freezing their verifiers to ensure that versions with the vulnerability will not be used in production.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sp1-stark","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/sp1-stark"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1/security/advisories/GHSA-c873-wfhp-wx5m"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-01-15T21:25:54Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.211709Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-753p-wrj5-g8fj","published":"2024-12-11T21:47:37Z","modified":"2024-12-11T21:48:32Z","summary":"PQClean has a correctness error in HQC decapsulation","details":"### Impact\n\nA correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism. Due to an indexing error, part of the secret key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data. This results in an incorrect shared secret value being returned when the decapsulation function is called with a malformed ciphertext.\n\nNo concrete attack exploiting the error has been identified at this point. However, the error involves mishandling of the secret key, and in principle this presents a security vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nPQClean does not have a release process, as it is a collection of implementations. If you obtained a HQC implementation from PQClean, please update to a version that includes the fixes proposed in https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/578. \n\nPlease also [refer to our security policy](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nManually patching is always possible\n\n### Further details\n\nIn the 2023/04/30 version of the HQC specification and reference implementation, an extra field (sigma) was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts. The logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation function was not updated accordingly. As a result, sigma is treated as part of the public key. Later in the decapsulation call, a incorrectly constructed comparison check allows this error to go through undetected. Due to how these two bugs interfere with each other, the decapsulation function never uses sigma to perform implicit rejection; instead, it accepts malformed ciphertexts and returns shared secrets based on their decryptions.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue was first reported in OQS https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7.

The patched versions now produce a compile time error if such a type is marked as `covariant`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"self_cell","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/self_cell"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-48m6-wm5p-rr6h/GHSA-48m6-wm5p-rr6h.json"}},{"package":{"name":"self_cell","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/self_cell"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.0.0"},{"fixed":"1.0.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-48m6-wm5p-rr6h/GHSA-48m6-wm5p-rr6h.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/issues/49"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0070.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-11-14T18:32:20Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.195186Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3gjh-29fv-8hr6","published":"2024-02-03T00:18:10Z","modified":"2024-02-03T00:18:10Z","summary":"Nervos CKB Snappy decompress length can be very large and causes out of memory error ","details":"### Impact\n\nAdversary can create message which compressed size is less than the package limit but the decompressed length is very large such as 1G.

Binary Protocol Misinterpretation caused by Truncating or Overflowing Casts","details":"The following presentation at this year's DEF CON was brought to our attention on the SQLx Discord:\n\n> SQL Injection isn't Dead: Smuggling Queries at the Protocol Level  \n> <http://web.archive.org/web/20240812130923/https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2032/DEF%20CON%2032%20presentations/DEF%20CON%2032%20-%20Paul%20Gerste%20-%20SQL%20Injection%20Isn't%20Dead%20Smuggling%20Queries%20at%20the%20Protocol%20Level.pdf>  \n> (Archive link for posterity.)\n\nEssentially, encoding a value larger than 4GiB can cause the length prefix in the protocol to overflow, \ncausing the server to interpret the rest of the string as binary protocol commands or other data.\n\nIt appears SQLx _does_ perform truncating casts in a way that could be problematic, \nfor example: <https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/6f2905695b9606b5f51b40ce10af63ac9e696bb8/sqlx-postgres/src/arguments.rs#L163>\n\nThis code has existed essentially since the beginning, \nso it is reasonable to assume that all published versions `<= 0.8.0` are affected.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAs always, you should make sure your application is validating untrustworthy user input. \nReject any input over 4 GiB, or any input that could _encode_ to a string longer than 4 GiB. \nDynamically built queries are also potentially problematic if it pushes the message size over this 4 GiB bound.\n\n[`Encode::size_hint()`](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/trait.Encode.html#method.size_hint) \ncan be used for sanity checks, but do not assume that the size returned is accurate. \nFor example, the `Json<T>` and `Text<T>` adapters have no reasonable way to predict or estimate the final encoded size, \nso they just return `size_of::<T>()` instead.\n\nFor web application backends, consider adding some middleware that limits the size of request bodies by default.\n\n## Resolution\n\nWork has started on a branch to add `#[deny]` directives for the following Clippy lints:\n\n* [`cast_possible_truncation`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_truncation)\n* [`cast_possible_wrap`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_possible_wrap)\n* [`cast_sign_loss`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#/cast_sign_loss)\n\nand to manually audit the code that they flag.\n\nA fix is expected to be included in the `0.8.1` release (still WIP as of writing).\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sqlx","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/sqlx"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.8.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<=

As a result, if a zone includes a DNSKEY with a public key that matches a configured trust anchor, all keys in that zone will be trusted to authenticate other records in the zone. There is a second variant of this vulnerability involving DS records, where an authenticated DS record covering one DNSKEY leads to trust in signatures made by an unrelated DNSKEY in the same zone.\n\nDetails\n\nverify_dnskey_rrset() will return Ok(true) if any record's public key matches a trust anchor. This results in verify_rrset() returning a Secure proof. This ultimately results in successfully verifying a response containing DNSKEY records. verify_default_rrset() looks up DNSKEY records by calling handle.lookup(), which takes the above code path. There's a comment following this that says \"DNSKEYs were already validated by the inner query in the above lookup\", but this is not the case. To fully verify the whole RRset of DNSKEYs, it would be necessary to check self-signatures by the trusted key over the other keys. Later in verify_default_rrset(), verify_rrset_with_dnskey() is called multiple times with different keys and signatures, and if any call succeeds, then its Proof is returned.\n\nSimilarly, verify_dnskey_rrset() returns Ok(false) if any DNSKEY record is covered by a DS record. A comment says \"If all the keys are valid, then we are secure\", but this is only checking that one key is authenticated by a DS in the parent zone's delegation point. This time, after control flow returns to verify_rrset(), it will call verify_default_rrset(). The special handling for DNSKEYs in verify_default_rrset() will then call verify_rrset_with_dnskey() using each KSK DNSKEY record, and if one call succeeds, return its Proof. If there are multiple KSK DNSKEYs in the RRset, then this leads to another authentication break. We need to either pass the authenticated DNSKEYs from the DS covering check to the RRSIG validation, or we need to perform this RRSIG validation of the DNSKEY RRset inside verify_dnskey_rrset() and cut verify_default_rrset() out of DNSKEY RRset validation

derivation method instantiated with certain curves may allow attacker to find derivation path which results into very long derivation (possible DoS)","details":"### Impact\n<!-- _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_ -->\n\n**Impacted are the only ones who use [`hd_wallet::Slip10Like`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/0.5.1/hd_wallet/struct.Slip10Like.html) or [`slip_10`](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/) derivation method instantiated with curves other than secp256k1 and secp256r1.**\n\n`hd_wallet` crate used to provide `Slip10Like` derivation method, which is also provided in `slip-10` crate as a default derivation method. It's based on [slip10](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md) method that searches for a valid child key in an infinite loop until it's found.\n\nTheoretically, this could be exploited by an attacker by finding a derivation path that would force someone to execute a lot of iterations of this loop to find a valid child key. This attack, however, requires the probability of getting an invalid scalar from random 32 bytes to be high. Slip10 is protected from this attack as it's only defined on secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves, for which such probability is very low:\n\n- For secp256k1, probability is $< 2^{-127}$. This means that a loop with 2 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n- For secp256r1, probability is $< 2^{-32}$. This means that a loop with 5 or more iterations is vanishingly impossible.\n\nWhile standard curves are safe to use with slip10, we used to allow slip10-like derivation which can be instantiated with any curve. For instance, one could instantiate it with ed25519 or stark curves, for which probability of getting invalid scalar from random 32 bytes is >90%, so theoretically, attacker could try to DoS such construction.\n\n### Patches\n<!-- _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_ -->\n\n`hd_wallet v0.6.0` has been patched by removing slip10-like derivation from public API.\n\nIf you need HD derivation on other curves than secp256k1 and secp256r1, we suggest you to use:\n* [`hd_wallet::Edwards`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/latest/hd_wallet/edwards/struct.Edwards.html) derivation method available for ed25519 curve\n* [`hd_wallet::Stark`](https://docs.rs/hd-wallet/latest/hd_wallet/stark/struct.Stark.html) derivation method available for stark curve\n\nBoth derivation methods are non-standard, but secure and efficient.\n\n**If you're still using `slip_10`** and would like to migrate to patched version, please migrate to `hd_wallet v0.6`. You may first migrate from `slip_10 v0.4` to `hd_wallet v0.5` by following migration instructions available [in the docs](https://docs.rs/slip-10/latest/slip_10/), and then upgrade from `hd_wallet v0.5` to `hd_wallet v0.6`.\n\n### Workarounds\nTechnically, you don't need to upgrade if you don't use slip10-like derivation instantiated with other curves than secp256k1 or secp256r1.\n\nHowever, if you do, migrating to other derivation method might be required.\n\n### Reach out to us in Discord\n\nIf you want to reach out to us, feel free to write to [`#lockness` room in Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/905194001349627914/1294284489635139585)\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Alessio Marziali <alessio.marziali@metaco.com> for discovering and flagging this issue","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hd-wallet","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/hd-wallet"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.6.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r.json"}},{"package":{"name":"slip-10","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/slip-10"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet/security/advisories/GHSA-2ff4-xfpr-m32r"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet/commit/a7e37704600ee7c737dbb02db08814dd2d15389d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/LFDT-Lockness/hd-wallet"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-12-18T15:51:24Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.189725Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-2q97-m5rc-p3gp","published":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","modified":"2024-12-10T16:55:39Z","summary":"CosmWasm VM Incorrect metering","details":"# CWA-2024-007\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.3\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.4\n- wasmvm < 1.5.5\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.4\n- cosmwasm-vm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.7\n- cosmwasm-vm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3\n- cosmwasm-vm 1.5.8, 2.0.7, 2.1.4\n\n## Description of the bug\n\n(Blank for now.

If affected versions of the Router receive highly compressed payloads, this could result in significant memory consumption while the compressed payload is expanded. \n\n### Patches\nRouter version 1.40.2 has a fix for the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are unable to upgrade, you may be able to implement mitigations at proxies or load balancers positioned in front of your Router fleet (e.g. Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-native WAF services) by creating limits on HTTP body upload size. \n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"apollo-router","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/apollo-router"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.9.5"},{"fixed":"1.40.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-cgqf-3cq5-wvcj"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/9e9527c73c8f34fc8438b09066163cd42520f413"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/apollographql/router"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-409"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-06T18:24:17Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.212335Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf","published":"2024-03-06T17:04:29Z","modified":"2024-03-06T17:42:13.690789Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-27934"],"related":["CVE-2024-27934"],"summary":"*const c_void / ExternalPointer unsoundness leading to use-after-free","details":"### Summary\n\nUse of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\n\n### Details\n\n`*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` (defined via `external!()` macros) types are used to represent `v8::External` wrapping arbitrary `void*` with an external lifetime. This is inherently unsafe as we are effectively eliding all Rust lifetime safety guarantees.\n\n`*const c_void` is trivially unsafe. `ExternalPointer` attempts to resolve this issue by wrapping the underlying pointer with a `usize`d marker ([`ExternalWithMarker<T>`](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/blob/a2838062a8f51926140a48a8aa926330c6f9070c/core/external.rs#L49)).\n\nHowever, the marker [relies on the randomness of PIE address (binary base address)](https://github.com/denoland/deno_core/blob/a2838062a8f51926140a48a8aa926330c6f9070c/core/external.rs#L10) which is still trivially exploitable for a non-PIE binary. It is also equally exploitable on a PIE binary when an attacker is able to derandomize the PIE address. This is problematic as it escalates an information leak of the PIE address into an exploitable vulnerability.\n\nNote that an attacker able to control code executed inside the Deno runtime is very likely to be able to bypass ASLR with any means necessary (e.g. by chaining another vulnerability, or by using other granted permissions such as `--allow-read` to read `/proc/self/maps`).\n\n\n### PoC\n\nFor simplicity, we use Deno version 1.38.0 where streaming operations uses `*const c_void`. Testing environment is Docker image `denoland/deno:alpine-1.38.0@sha256:fe51a00f4fbbaf1e72b29667c3eeeda429160cef2342f22a92c3820020d41f38` although the exact versions shouldn't matter much if it's in 1.36.2 up to 1.38.0 (before `ExternalPointer` patch, refer Impact section for details)\n\n```js\nconst ops = Deno[Deno.internal].core.ops;\nconst rid = ops.op_readable_stream_resource_allocate();\nconst sink = ops.op_readable_stream_resource_get_sink(rid);\n\n// close\nops.op_readable_stream_resource_close(sink);\nops.op_readable_stream_resource_close(sink);\n\n// reclaim BoundedBufferChannelInner\nconst ab = new ArrayBuffer(0x8058);\nconst dv = new DataView(ab);\n\n// forge chunk contents\ndv.setBigUint64(0, 2n, true);\ndv.setBigUint64(0x8030, 0x1337c0d30000n, true);\n\n// trigger segfault\nDeno.close(rid);\n```\n\nBelow is the dmesg log after the crash. We see that Deno has segfaulted on `1337c0d30008`, which is +8 of what we have written at offset 0x8030. Note also that the dereferenced value will immediately be used as a function pointer, with the first argument dereferenced from offset 0x8038 - it is trivial to use this to build an end-to-end exploit.\n\n```text\n[ 6439.821046] deno[15088]: segfault at 1337c0d30008 ip 0000557b53e2fb3e sp 00007fffd485ac70 error 4 in deno[557b51714000+2d7f000] likely on CPU 12 (core 12, socket 0)\n[ 6439.821054] Code: 00 00 00 00 48 85 c0 74 03 ff 50 08 49 8b 86 30 80 00 00 49 8b be 38 80 00 00 49 c7 86 30 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 48 85 c0 74 03 <ff> 50 08 48 ff 03 48 83 c4 08 5b 41 5e c3 48 8d 3d 0d 1a 59 fb 48\n```\n\nThe same vulnerability exists for `ExternalPointer` implementation, but now it is required for the attacker to either leak the PIE address somehow, or else exploit unexpected aliasing behavior of `v8::External` values. The latter has not been investigated in depth, but it is theoretically possible to alias the same underlying pointer to different `v8::External` on different threads (Workers) and exploit the concurrency (`RefCell` may break this though).\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUse of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions.\n\nThis bug is **known to be exploitable** for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations.\n\nAffected versions of Deno is from 1.36.2 up to latest.\n\n- [ext/web/stream_resource.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/ext/web/stream_resource.rs):\n  - `*const c_void` introduced in 1.36.2\n  - Patched into `ExternalPointer` in 1.38.1\n- [ext/http/http_next.rs](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/ext/http/http_next.rs):\n  - `ExternalPointer` introduced in 1.38.2\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"deno","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/deno"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.36.2"},{"fixed":"1.40.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/denoland/deno"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-06T17:04:29Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.192998Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3xc6-7h59-j2x4","published":"2024-03-06T00:31:27Z","modified":"2024-03-06T15:34:11Z","withdrawn":"2024-03-06T15:34:11Z","summary":"Duplicate Advisory: eza Potential Heap Overflow Vulnerability for AArch64","details":"## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-3qx3-6hxr-j2ch.

A malicious package included as a dependency may inject nearly arbitrary HTML here, potentially leading to XSS if the report is subsequently uploaded somewhere.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability is \"low\" for users relying on dependencies from git, local paths, or alternative registries. Users who solely depend on crates.io are unaffected.\n\n\nNote that **by design** Cargo allows code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability in this advisory allows performing a subset of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros.\n\n# Overview\n\nRust 1.60.0 [introduced](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/04/07/Rust-1.60.0.html#cargo---timings) `cargo build --timings`, which produces a report of how long the different steps of the build process took. It includes lists of Cargo features for each crate.\n\nPrior to Rust 1.72, Cargo feature names were allowed to contain almost any characters (with some exceptions as used by the feature syntax), but it would produce a future incompatibility warning about them [since Rust 1.49](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8814). crates.io is far more stringent about what it considers a valid feature name and has not allowed such feature names.\n\nAs the feature names defined in the `Cargo.toml` file were included unescaped in the timings report, they could be used to inject Javascript into the page.

This means that two distinct Git objects with colliding SHA-1 hashes would break the Git object model and integrity checks when used with gitoxide.\n\nThe SHA-1 function is considered cryptographically insecure. However, in the wake of the SHAttered attacks, this issue was mitigated in Git 2.13.0 in 2017 by using the [sha1collisiondetection](https://github.com/crmarcstevens/sha1collisiondetection) algorithm by default and producing an error when known SHA-1 collisions are detected. Git is in the process of migrating to using SHA-256 for object hashes, but this has not been rolled out widely yet and gitoxide does not support SHA-256 object hashes.\n\n### PoC\nThe following program demonstrates the problem, using the two [SHAttered PDFs](https://shattered.io/):\n\n```rust\nuse sha1_checked::{CollisionResult, Digest};\n\nfn sha1_oid_of_file(filename: &str) -> gix::ObjectId {\n    let mut hasher = gix::features::hash::hasher(gix::hash::Kind::Sha1);\n    hasher.update(&std::fs::read(filename).unwrap());\n    gix::ObjectId::Sha1(hasher.digest())\n}\n\nfn sha1dc_oid_of_file(filename: &str) -> Result<gix::ObjectId, String> {\n    // Matches Git’s behaviour.\n    let mut hasher = sha1_checked::Builder::default().safe_hash(false).build();\n    hasher.update(&std::fs::read(filename).unwrap());\n    match hasher.try_finalize() {\n        CollisionResult::Ok(digest) => Ok(gix::ObjectId::Sha1(digest.into())),\n        CollisionResult::Mitigated(_) => unreachable!(),\n        CollisionResult::Collision(digest) => Err(format!(\n            \"Collision attack: {}\",\n            gix::ObjectId::Sha1(digest.into()).to_hex()\n        )),\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    dbg!(sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\"));\n    dbg!(sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\"));\n}\n```\n\nThe output is as follows:\n\n```\n[src/main.rs:24:5] sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\") = Sha1(38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a)\n[src/main.rs:25:5] sha1_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\") = Sha1(38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a)\n[src/main.rs:26:5] sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-1.pdf\") = Err(\n    \"Collision attack: 38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a\",\n)\n[src/main.rs:27:5] sha1dc_oid_of_file(\"shattered-2.pdf\") = Err(\n    \"Collision attack: 38762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a\",\n)\n```\n\nThe latter behaviour matches Git.\n\nSince the SHAttered PDFs are not in a valid format for Git objects, a direct proof‐of‐concept using higher‐level APIs cannot be immediately demonstrated without significant computational resources.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker with the ability to mount a collision attack on SHA-1 like the [SHAttered](https://shattered.io/) or [SHA-1 is a Shambles](https://sha-mbles.github.io/) attacks could create two distinct Git objects with the same hash. This is becoming increasingly affordable for well‐resourced attackers, with the Shambles researchers in 2020 estimating $45k for a chosen‐prefix collision or $11k for a classical collision, and projecting less than $10k for a chosen‐prefix collision by 2025.

The query executes in the context of the querying user, rather than the user who originally defined the future. Likewise, fields containing functions or custom-defined logic (`closures`) are executed under the privileges of the invoking user, not the creator.\n\nThis results in a confused deputy vulnerability: an attacker with limited privileges can define a malicious function or future field that performs privileged actions. When a higher-privileged user (such as a root owner or namespace administrator) executes the function or queries or modifies that record, the function executes with their elevated permissions. \n\n### Impact\nAn attacker who can create or update function/future fields can plant logic that executes with a privileged user’s context. If a privileged user performs a write that touches the malicious field, the attacker can achieve full privilege escalation (e.g., create a root owner and take over the server). \n\nIf a privileged user performs a read action on the malicious field, this attack vector could still be potentially be used to perform limited denial of service or, in the specific case where the network capability was explicitly enabled and unrestricted, exfiltrate database information over the network.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersions prior to 2.5.0 and 3.0.0-beta.3 are vulnerable.\n\nFor SurrealDB 3.0, `futures` are no longer supported, replaced by `computed`  fields, only available within schemaful tables. \n\nFurther to this patches for 2.5.0 and 3.0.0-beta.3: \n- Implements an `auth_limit` on defined apis, functions, fields and events, that limits execution to the permissions of the creating user instead of the invoking user.\n- Prevents `closures` from being stored, that eliminates a potential attack surface. For 2.5.0 this can still be allowed by using the `insecure_storable_closures` capability\n- Ensures the proper auth level is used to compute expressions in signin & signup\n\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers unable to patch are advised to evaluate their use of the database to identify where low privileged users are able to define logic subsequently executed by privileged users, such as apis, functions, futures fields and events, and recommended to minimise these instances.\n\n### References\n[Futures](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/datamodel/futures)\n[Closures](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/datamodel/closures)\n[SurrealDB Environment Variables](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/cli/env)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.5.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-3v2x-9xcv-2v2v/GHSA-3v2x-9xcv-2v2v.json"}},{"package":{"name":"surrealdb","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/surrealdb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.0-alpha.1"},{"fixed":"3.0.0-beta.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-3v2x-9xcv-2v2v/GHSA-3v2x-9xcv-2v2v.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories/GHSA-3v2x-9xcv-2v2v"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/commit/f515c91363ee735aa1bc08580d9e7fa0de6e736f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/releases/tag/v2.5.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.2"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-441"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-22T18:06:15Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.193777Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-hf79-8hjp-rrvq","published":"2021-11-30T22:20:36Z","modified":"2026-01-20T19:17:50.405777Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-43790","RUSTSEC-2021-0155"],"related":["CVE-2021-43790"],"summary":"Use After Free in lucet","details":"### Impact\nThere is a bug in the main branch of Lucet's `lucet-runtime` that allows a use-after-free in an `Instance` object that could result in memory corruption, data race, or other related issues.

When processing archives with PAX-extended headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly advances stream position based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified size, causing it to interpret file content as legitimate tar headers.\n\nThis vulnerability was disclosed to multiple Rust tar parsers, all derived from the original `async-tar` fork of `tar-rs`.\n\n## Details\n\n### Vulnerability Description\n\nThe vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of PAX extended headers versus ustar headers when determining file data boundaries. Specifically:\n\n1. **PAX header** correctly specifies the file size (e.g., `size=1048576`)\n2. **ustar header** incorrectly specifies zero size (`size=000000000000`)\n3. **tokio-tar** advances the stream position based on the ustar size (0 bytes)\n4. **Inner content** is then interpreted as legitimate outer archive entries\n\n### Attack Mechanism\n\nWhen a TAR file contains:\n\n- An outer entry with PAX `size=N` but ustar `size=0`\n- File data that begins with valid TAR header structures\n- The parser treats inner content as additional outer entries\n\nThis creates a **header/data desynchronization** where the parser's position becomes misaligned with actual file boundaries.\n\n### Root Cause\n\n```rust\n// Vulnerable: Uses ustar size instead of PAX override\nlet file_size = header.size(); // Returns 0 from ustar field\nlet next_pos = current_pos + 512 + pad_to_512(file_size); // Advances 0 bytes\n\n// Fixed: Apply PAX overrides before position calculation\nlet mut file_size = header.size();\nif let Some(pax_size) = pending_pax.get(\"size\") {\n    file_size = pax_size.parse().unwrap();\n}\nlet next_pos = current_pos + 512 + pad_to_512(file_size); // Correct advance\n\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability depends on where `astral-tokio-tar` is used, and whether it is used to extract untrusted tar archives. If used to extract untrusted inputs, it may result in unexpected attacker-controlled access to the filesystem, in turn potential resulting in arbitrary code execution or credential exfiltration.\n\nSee [**GHSA-w476-p2h3-79g9**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/security/advisories/GHSA-w476-p2h3-79g9) for how this vulnerability affects `uv`, `astral-tokio-tar`'s primary downstream user. Observe that **unlike** this advisory,` uv`'s advisory is considered **low severity** due to overlap with intentional existing capabilities in source distributions. \n\n## Workarounds\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to version 0.5.6 or newer to address this advisory.\n\nThere is no workaround other than upgrading.\n\n## Timeline\n\n| Date | Event |\n| --- | --- |\n| Aug 21, 2025 | Vulnerability discovered by Edera Security Team |\n| Aug 21, 2025 | Initial analysis and PoC confirmed |\n| Aug 22, 2025 | Maintainers notified (privately) |\n| Aug 25, 2025 | Private patch and test suite shared |\n| Oct 7, 2025 | Text freeze for GHSA |\n| Oct 21, 2025 | Coordinated public disclosure and patched releases |\n\n## Credits\n\n- **Discovered by:** Steven Noonan (Edera) and Alex Zenla (Edera)\n- **Coordinated disclosure:** Ann Wallace (Edera)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"astral-tokio-tar","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/astral-tokio-tar"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.5.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.5.5","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx/GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"tokio-tar","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/tokio-tar"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"0.3.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx/GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/security/advisories/GHSA-w476-p2h3-79g9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar/commit/22b3f884adb7a2adf1d3a8d03469533f5cbc8318"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://edera.dev/stories/tarmageddon"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/edera-dev/cve-tarmageddon"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0110.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0111.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-843"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-21T15:42:51Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-10-21T17:15:40Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.221250Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0110","published":"2025-10-21T12:00:00Z","modified":"2026-01-17T07:55:59.809793Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-62518","GHSA-j5gw-2vrg-8fgx","RUSTSEC-2025-0111"],"summary":"astral-tokio-tar Vulnerable to PAX Header Desynchronization","details":"Versions of astral-tokio-tar prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing\nvulnerability that allows attackers to smuggle additional archive entries by\nexploiting inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling.

The analyzer flags:\n\n- **UDIV/SDIV instructions**: Hardware division instructions have early termination optimizations where execution time depends on operand values.\n\nThe `decompose` function used a hardware division instruction to compute `r1.0 / TwoGamma2::U32`. This function is called during signing through `high_bits()` and `low_bits()`, which process values derived from secret key components:\n\n- `(&w - &cs2).low_bits()` where `cs2` is derived from secret key component `s2`\n- `Hint::new()` calls `high_bits()` on values derived from secret key component `t0`\n\n**Original Code**:\n```rust\nfn decompose<TwoGamma2: Unsigned>(self) -> (Elem, Elem) {\n    // ...\n    let mut r1 = r_plus - r0;\n    r1.0 /= TwoGamma2::U32;  // Variable-time division on secret-derived data\n    (r1, r0)\n}\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nI do not have an exploit written for this, currently.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe dividend (`r1.0`) is derived from secret key material. An attacker with precise timing measurements could extract information about the signing key by observing timing variations in the division operation.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nReplacing division with constant-time Barrett reduction mitigates this risk.

An attacker can submit short/undersized ciphertext or carefully-crafted DER-encoded structures to trigger bounds-check panics (Rust unwinding) which crash the calling thread or process.\n\n\n### Affected Component / Versions\n\n- File: `src/pke/decrypting.rs`\n\n- Functions: `DecryptingKey::decrypt_digest/decrypt/decrypt_der`, internal `decrypt()` implementation\n\n- Affected releases: \n  \n  - sm2 0.14.0-rc.0 (https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-rc.0)\n  - sm2 0.14.0-pre.0 (https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-pre.0)\n  \n  \n\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability is located in the file `sm2/src/pke/decrypting.rs`. The **fundamental cause** of the vulnerability is that the decryption function **does not strictly check** the ciphertext's format and length information. Consequently, a maliciously crafted ciphertext can trigger Rust's **panic mechanism** instead of the expected error handling (`Error`) mechanism. The Rust function `C.split_at(L)` will trigger a Panic if the length is less than `L`, as shown in the code comment below: the `decrypting` function has **at least three locations** where a slice operation might trigger a Panic.\n\n```rust\nfn decrypt(\n    secret_scalar: &Scalar,\n    mode: Mode,\n    hasher: &mut dyn DynDigest,\n    cipher: &[u8],\n) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {\n    let q = U256::from_be_hex(FieldElement::MODULUS);\n    let c1_len = q.bits().div_ceil(8) * 2 + 1;  // Typically 65 for SM2\n\n    // B1: get 𝐶1 from 𝐶\n    let (c1, c) = cipher.split_at(c1_len as usize);  // PANIC HERE if cipher.len() < 65\n    let encoded_c1 = EncodedPoint::from_bytes(c1).map_err(Error::from)?;\n\n    // ... (lines 170-178 omitted)\n\n    let digest_size = hasher.output_size();  // Typically 32 for SM3\n    let (c2, c3) = match mode {\n        Mode::C1C3C2 => {\n            let (c3, c2) = c.split_at(digest_size);  // PANIC HERE if c.len() < 32\n            (c2, c3)\n        }\n        Mode::C1C2C3 => c.split_at(c.len() - digest_size),  // PANIC HERE if c.len() < 32\n    };\n\n```\n\nRust's `slice::split_at` panics when the split index is greater than the slice length. A panic in library code typically unwinds the thread and can crash an application if not explicitly caught. This means an attacker that can submit ciphertexts to a service using this library may cause a DoS.\n\n\n\n\n### Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\nTwo PoCs were added to this repository under `examples/` demonstrating the two\ncommon ways to trigger the issue:\n\n- `examples/poc_short_ciphertext.rs` — constructs a deliberately undersized\n  ciphertext (e.g., `vec![0u8; 10]`) and passes it to `DecryptingKey::decrypt`.\n  This triggers the `cipher.split_at(c1_len)` panic.\n\n  ``` rust\n  //! PoC: trigger panic in SM2 decryption by supplying a ciphertext that is shorter\n  //! than the expected C1 length so that `cipher.split_at(c1_len)` panics.\n  //!\n  //! Usage:\n  //!   cargo run --example poc_short_ciphertext\n  \n  use rand_core::OsRng;\n  \n  use sm2::pke::DecryptingKey;\n  use sm2::SecretKey;\n  \n  fn main() {\n      // Generate a normal secret key and DecryptingKey instance.\n      let mut rng = OsRng;\n      let sk = SecretKey::try_from_rng(&mut rng).expect(\"failed to generate secret key\");\n      let dk = DecryptingKey::new(sk);\n  \n      // to trigger the vulnerability in `decrypt()` where it does `cipher.split_at(c1_len)`.\n      let short_ciphertext = vec![0u8; 10]; // deliberately too short\n  \n      println!(\"Calling decrypt with undersized ciphertext (len = {})...\", short_ciphertext.len());\n  \n      // The panic is the PoC for the lack of length validation.\n      let _ = dk.decrypt(&short_ciphertext);\n  \n      // If the library were robust, this line would be reached and decrypt would return Err.\n      println!(\"decrypt returned (unexpected) - PoC did not panic\");\n  }\n  ```\n  \n  \n  \n- `examples/poc_der_short.rs` — constructs an ASN.1 `Cipher` structure with\n  valid-length `x`/`y` coordinates (from a generated public key) but with tiny\n  `digest` and `cipher` OCTET STRING fields (1 byte each). When run with the\n  crate built with `--features std`, `Cipher::from_der` accepts the DER and the\n  call flows into `decrypt()`, which then panics on the later `split_at`.\n  \n  ``` rust\n  //!

Minimal fixes in `decrypt()`:\n\n```rust\nlet c1_len_usize = c1_len as usize;\nif cipher.len() < c1_len_usize {\n    return Err(Error);\n}\nlet (c1, c) = cipher.split_at(c1_len_usize);\n\nlet digest_size = hasher.output_size();\nif c.len() < digest_size {\n    return Err(Error);\n}\nlet (c2, c3) = match mode {\n    Mode::C1C3C2 => {\n        let (c3, c2) = c.split_at(digest_size);\n        (c2, c3)\n    }\n    Mode::C1C2C3 => c.split_at(c.len() - digest_size),\n};\n```\n\nAfter applying these checks, `decrypt()` will return an error for short or malformed inputs instead of panicking.\n\n\n\n### **Credit**\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n\n- XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab\n\n- Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine\n\nCVE and credit are preferred.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the vulnerability details, please feel free to reach out to us for further discussion.

A unit mismatch error causes the nonce generation function to request only 32 bits of randomness instead of the expected 256 bits. This reduces the security of the encryption from a 128-bit level to a trivial 16-bit level, allowing a practical attack to recover the nonce `k` and decrypt any ciphertext **given only the public key and ciphertext**.\n\n\n\n### Affected Versions\n\n- sm2 0.14.0-rc.0 (https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-rc.0)\n- sm2 0.14.0-pre.0 (https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-pre.0)\n\nThis vulnerability is introduced in commit: [Commit 4781762](https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/commit/4781762f23ff22ab34763410f648128055c93731) on Sep 6, 2024, which is over a year ago.\n\n\n\n### Details\n\nThe root cause of this vulnerability is a unit mismatch in the `encrypt` function located in `sm2/src/pke/encrypting.rs`.\n\n1.  The code correctly calculates the byte-length of the curve order (256 bits / 8 = 32 bytes) and stores it in a constant `N_BYTES`.\n    ```rust\n    const N_BYTES: u32 = Sm2::ORDER.as_ref().bits().div_ceil(8); // Value is 32 (bytes)\n    ```\n2.  However, this `N_BYTES` value is then passed to the `next_k` helper function, which incorrectly interprets this value as a *bit length*.\n    ```rust\n    let k = Scalar::from_uint(&next_k(rng, N_BYTES)?).unwrap();\n    ```\n3.  Inside `next_k`, the `bit_length` parameter (which holds the value 32) is passed directly to `U256::try_random_bits`, a function that generates a random number with the specified number of bits.\n    ```rust\n    fn next_k<R: TryCryptoRng + ?Sized>(rng: &mut R, bit_length: u32) -> Result<U256> {\n        let k = U256::try_random_bits(rng, bit_length).map_err(|_| Error)?;\n        // ...\n    }\n    ```\n    As a result, the ephemeral nonce `k` is generated with only 32 bits of entropy, with its upper 224 bits being zero. This catastrophic loss of randomness makes the encryption scheme insecure.\n    \n    \n\n### PoC\n\nA proof-of-concept demonstrating the feasibility of this attack is provided in `examples/bsgs_recover.rs`. The PoC performs the following steps:\n\n1.  **Encrypt a Message**: It uses the vulnerable `EncryptingKey::encrypt` function to encrypt a sample message.\n2.  **Extract Ephemeral Public Key**: It parses the ciphertext to extract `C1`, which is the ephemeral public key `[k]G`.\n3.  **Recover Nonce `k`**: It runs a Baby-Step Giant-Step (BSGS) algorithm to search the reduced 2^32 search space for the nonce `k`. This attack is computationally feasible on modern hardware in seconds with time complexity `O(2^16)`.\n4.  **Decrypt without Secret Key**: Once `k` is recovered, it computes the shared secret `[k]PB` (where `PB` is the recipient's public key) and successfully decrypts the ciphertext without access to the recipient's secret key.\n\n`examples/bsgs_recover.rs`\n\n``` rust\n//! Example: Recover low-entropy nonce k via Baby-Step Giant-Step (BSGS)\n//!\n//! This example intentionally demonstrates an attack on the vulnerable\n//! `EncryptingKey::encrypt` implementation which (in the current repository\n//! state) may generate k with only 32 bits of entropy.

The calling code previously used `.unwrap()`, causing a panic when presented with such input.\n\n\n\n\n### Affected Component / Versions\n\n- File: `src/pke/decrypting.rs`\n\n- Function: internal `decrypt()` (invoked by `DecryptingKey::decrypt*` methods)\n\n- Affected releases: \n\n  - sm2 0.14.0-rc.0 (https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-rc.0)\n  - sm2 0.14.0-pre.0 (https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-pre.0)\n\n  \n\n\n### Details\n\nThe library decodes the C1 field (an EC point) as an `EncodedPoint` and then converts it to an `AffinePoint` using `AffinePoint::from_encoded_point(&encoded_c1)`. That conversion returns a `CtOption<AffinePoint>` (or an `Option` equivalent) which will indicate failure when the coordinates do not satisfy the curve equation. The code then called `.unwrap()` on that result, causing a panic when\n`None` was returned. Because `EncodedPoint::from_bytes()` only validates format (length and SEC1\nencoding) and not mathematical validity, an attacker can craft `C1 = 0x04 || X || Y` with X and Y of the right length that nonetheless do not satisfy the curve. Such inputs will pass the format check but trigger `from_encoded_point()` failure and therefore panic on `.unwrap()`.\n\n\n\n\n### Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\n`examples/poc_der_invalid_point.rs` constructs an ASN.1 DER `Cipher` structure\nwith `x` and `y` set to arbitrary 32-byte values (e.g., repeating 0x11 and 0x22),\nand passes it to `DecryptingKey::decrypt_der`. With the vulnerable code, this\nproduces a panic originating at the `unwrap()` call in `decrypt()`. Other APIs such as `DecryptingKey::decrypt` also produce a panic with invalid C1 point.\n\n``` rust\n//! PoC: trigger invalid-point panic via `decrypt_der` by providing ASN.1 DER\n//! where x/y are valid-length integers but do not lie on the curve.\n//!\n//! Usage:\n//!

Example minimal fix:\n\n```rust\n    // Return an error instead of panicking when the provided point is not on the curve.\n    let mut c1_point: AffinePoint = match AffinePoint::from_encoded_point(&encoded_c1).into() {\n        Some(p) => p,\n        None => return Err(Error),\n    };\n```\n\nThis ensures `decrypt()` returns a controlled error for invalid or malformed points instead of panicking.\n\n\n\n### **Credit**\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by:\n\n- XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab\n\n- Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine\n\nCVE and credit are preferred.\n\nIf developers have any questions regarding the vulnerability details, please feel free to reach for further discussion via email at xlabai@tencent.com.\n\n \n\n### **Note**\n\nThis organization follows the security industry standard disclosure policy—the 90+30 policy (reference: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-policy.html).

VULNERABLE: volume_dir.join(Path::new(&path))\n   ↓\n6. File Read: /data/rustfs0/.rustfs.sys/../../../../etc/passwd\n              → /etc/passwd\n```\n\n### Path Traversal Mechanism\n\n```rust\n// Example traversal:\nvolume_dir = PathBuf::from(\"/data/rustfs0/.rustfs.sys\")\npath = \"../../../../etc/passwd\"\n\n// PathBuf::join() resolves to:\nfile_path = \"/data/rustfs0/.rustfs.sys/../../../../etc/passwd\"\n          = \"/etc/passwd\"  // Successfully escaped!\n```\n\n### Why It Works\n\n1. **No Canonicalization**: Code doesn't use `canonicalize()` before validation\n2. **No Boundary Check**: No verification that final path is within volume_dir\n3. **PathBuf::join() Behavior**: Automatically resolves `../` sequences\n4. **Length-Only Validation**: `check_path_length()` only checks string length\n\n### Special Considerations\n\n- **File Size Constraint**: The `length` parameter must exactly match file size\n  - Code validates: `file.len() >= offset + length`\n  - Otherwise returns `DiskError::FileCorrupt`\n- **Volume Requirement**: Volume/bucket must exist (e.g., `.rustfs.sys`)\n- **Disk Requirement**: Disk must be registered in `GLOBAL_LOCAL_DISK_MAP`\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\n### Confidentiality Impact: HIGH\n\n- ✅ Read arbitrary files (demonstrated)\n- ✅ Read system configuration files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`)\n- ⚠️ Potential to read:\n  - SSH keys (`/root/.ssh/id_rsa`)\n  - Application secrets\n  - RustFS configuration files\n  - Environment variables from `/proc`\n\n### Integrity Impact: HIGH\n\n- ⚠️ Similar vulnerability exists in `put_file_stream` (not tested)\n- ⚠️ Arbitrary file write likely possible\n- ⚠️ Could write to:\n  - Cron jobs\n  - authorized_keys\n  - System binaries (if permissions allow)\n\n### Availability Impact: MEDIUM\n\n- ⚠️ `walk_dir` endpoint could enumerate entire filesystem\n- ⚠️ Potential DoS via recursive directory traversal\n\n## Exploitation Requirements\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Network Access**: Ability to reach RustFS RPC endpoints\n2. **RPC Secret Knowledge**: Knowledge of RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY\n   - Default: `\"rustfs-default-secret\"`\n   - Production: From environment variable or config\n3. **Disk/Volume Knowledge**: Valid disk ID and volume name\n4. **File Size Knowledge**: Exact file sizes for successful reads\n\n### Attack Complexity\n\n- **Without Secret**: Impossible (signature verification)\n- **With Secret**: Trivial (automated script)\n- **With Default Secret**: Critical risk if not changed\n\n## Mitigation Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions (Priority 0)\n\n1. **Path Canonicalization**\n```rust\nasync fn read_file_stream(&self, volume: &str, path: &str, ...) -> Result<FileReader> {\n    let volume_dir = self.get_bucket_path(volume)?;\n\n    // CRITICAL FIX:\n    let file_path = volume_dir.join(Path::new(&path));\n    let canonical = file_path.canonicalize()\n        .map_err(|_| DiskError::FileNotFound)?;\n\n    // Validate path is within volume_dir\n    if !canonical.starts_with(&volume_dir) {\n        error!(\"Path traversal attempt detected: {:?}\", path);\n        return Err(DiskError::InvalidArgument);\n    }\n\n    // Continue with validated path...\n}\n```\n\n2. **Path Component Validation**\n```rust\n// Reject dangerous path components\nif path.contains(\"..\") || path.starts_with('/') {\n    return Err(DiskError::InvalidArgument);\n}\n```\n\n3. **Use path-clean Crate**\n```rust\nuse path_clean::PathClean;\n\nlet cleaned_path = PathBuf::from(&path).clean();\nif cleaned_path.to_string_lossy().contains(\"..\") {\n    return Err(DiskError::InvalidArgument);\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Security Measures\n\n4. **Audit Logging**: Log all RPC file operations with full paths\n5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent DoS via repeated RPC calls\n6. **Secret Rotation**: Ensure unique RPC secrets per deployment\n7. **Network Segmentation**: Restrict RPC endpoint access\n8. **Security Testing**: Add path traversal tests to test suite\n\n### Long-term Improvements\n\n9. **Chroot Jail**: Isolate RPC operations in chroot environment\n10. **Least Privilege**: Run RustFS with minimal file system permissions\n11. **Security Audit**: Comprehensive review of all file operations\n\n## Proof of Concept Script\n\nThe complete PoC is available at: `exploit_path_traversal.py`\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\n# Ensure RustFS is running\ndocker compose ps\n\n# Run exploit\npython3 exploit_path_traversal.py\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\n[+] SUCCESS!

This allows a local attacker to inject arbitrary Python code via a malicious rule or configuration file, which is then executed with root privileges.\n\n**Who is impacted:**\nAny system where this tool is executed with elevated privileges is affected. In environments where the tool is permitted to run via `sudo` without a password (`NOPASSWD`), a local unprivileged user can escalate privileges to root without additional interaction.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in version **0.1.1**.\n\nThe patch introduces strict ownership and permission checks for all configuration files and custom rules. The application now enforces that rules are only loaded if they are owned by the effective user executing the tool.\n\nWhen executed with elevated privileges (`EUID=0`), the application refuses to load any files that are not owned by root or that are writable by non-root users. When executed as a non-root user, it similarly refuses to load rules owned by other users. This prevents both vertical and horizontal privilege escalation via execution of untrusted code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not possible, users should avoid executing the pplication with `sudo` or as the root user.\n\nAs a temporary mitigation, ensure that directories containing custom rules and configuration files are owned by root and are not writable by non-root users. Administrators may also audit existing custom rules before running the tool with elevated privileges.\n\n### References\n\n* [Commit fixing the issue](https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/theshit/commit/3dc12905cafb5fd47fff4071a05c231f925ac113)\n* CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management\n* CWE-284: Improper Access Control\n* CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere","affected":[{"package":{"name":"theshit","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/theshit"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.1.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-95qg-89c2-w5hj/GHSA-95qg-89c2-w5hj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/theshit/security/advisories/GHSA-95qg-89c2-w5hj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69257"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/theshit/commit/8e0b565e7876a83b0e1cfbacb8af39dadfdcc500"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/AsfhtgkDavid/theshit"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0139.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-269"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-30T23:45:51Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-30T20:16:01Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.208704Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0139","published":"2025-12-30T12:00:00Z","modified":"2026-01-04T20:44:03.068583Z","summary":"theshit vulnerable to unsafe loading of user-owned Python rules when running as root","details":"The application loads custom Python rules and configuration files from user-writable locations (e.g., `~/.config/theshit/`) without validating ownership or permissions when executed with elevated privileges.\n\nIf the tool is invoked with `sudo` or otherwise runs with an effective UID of root, it continues to trust configuration files originating from the unprivileged user's environment.

Depending on the specific nature of the program this may enable Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs) which can cause a catastrophic breakage of the cipher including full plaintext recovery.\n\n### Details\nAs seen in the implementation of [decrypt_in_place_detached](https://docs.rs/aes-gcm/latest/src/aes_gcm/lib.rs.html#309) for AES GCM, if the tag verification fails, an error is returned. Because the decryption of the ciphertext is done in place, the plaintext contents are now exposed via `buffer`. \n\nThis should ideally not be the case - as noted in page 17 of[ NIST's publication _Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC_](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf): \n_In Step 8, the result of Step 7 is compared with the authentication tag that was received as an input: if they are identical, then the plaintext is returned; otherwise,FAIL is returned._\n\nThis is seems correctly addressed in the [AES GCM SIV implementation](https://docs.rs/aes-gcm-siv/latest/src/aes_gcm_siv/lib.rs.html#307), where the decrypted buffer is encrypted again before the error is returned - this fix is straightforward to implement in AES GCM. To ensure that these types of cases are covered during testing, it would be valuable to add test cases like [23, 24 ](https://github.com/google/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors/aes_gcm_test.json#L288)etc from [project wycheproof ](https://github.com/google/wycheproof)to ensure that when a bad tag is used, there is an error on decryption _**and**_ that the plaintext value is not exposed. \n\n### PoC\nTo reproduce this issue, I'm using [test case 23](https://github.com/google/wycheproof/blob/master/testvectors/aes_gcm_test.json#L288) from project wycheproof. \n```rust\n    let key = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f\"));\n    let nonce = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"505152535455565758595a5b\"));\n    let tag = GenericArray::from_slice(&hex!(\"d9847dbc326a06e988c77ad3863e6083\")); // bad tag\n    let mut ct = hex!(\"eb156d081ed6b6b55f4612f021d87b39\");\n    let msg = hex!(\"202122232425262728292a2b2c2d2e2f\");\n    let aad = hex!(\"\");\n    let cipher = Aes128Gcm::new(&key);\n    let _plaintext = cipher.decrypt_in_place_detached(&nonce, &aad, &mut ct, &tag);\n    assert_eq!(ct, msg);\n```","affected":[{"package":{"name":"aes-gcm","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/aes-gcm"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.10.0"},{"fixed":"0.10.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.10.2","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/09/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/security/advisories/GHSA-423w-p2w9-r7vq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42811"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://docs.rs/aes-gcm/latest/src/aes_gcm/lib.rs.html#309"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ROBB6TBDAGEQ2WIINR34F3DPSN3FND6K"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RYQCICN6BVC6I75O3F6W4VK4J3MOYDJU"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U67ZSMNX5V3WTBYPUYF45PSFG4SF5SGF"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0096.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-09-22T16:11:47Z","nvd_published_at":"2023-09-22T16:15:10Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.194259Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-r2jw-c95q-rj29","published":"2024-10-02T06:30:26Z","modified":"2025-12-29T22:29:44.035578Z","withdrawn":"2025-12-29T22:23:36Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-21530","GHSA-6878-6wc2-pf5h","RUSTSEC-2023-0068"],"summary":"Duplicate Advisory: cocoon Reuses a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption","details":"### Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-6878-6wc2-pf5h.

It will likely occur unintentionally in 1 out of every 2**32 packets sent or received.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ring","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/ring"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.17.13"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/05/GHSA-c86p-w88r-qvqr/GHSA-c86p-w88r-qvqr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4432"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/pull/2447"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/commit/ec2d3cf1d91f148c84e4806b4f0b3c98f6df3b38"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-4432"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2350655"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/briansmith/ring"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/main/RELEASES.md#version-01712-2025-03-05"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0009.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-770"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-05-09T19:42:41Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-05-09T16:15:25Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.211651Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-4p46-pwfr-66x6","published":"2025-03-07T16:23:50Z","modified":"2025-12-29T21:52:30.905112Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-4432","GHSA-c86p-w88r-qvqr","GO-2025-3678","RUSTSEC-2025-0009"],"related":["CGA-2ghq-vwg6-p2gr","CGA-2hpr-374j-w484","CGA-325j-mxcp-j9pm","CGA-3993-pvwh-4q44","CGA-3j2j-3qpj-c259","CGA-3xvg-vvq8-mfrp","CGA-47fg-ffmv-48mr","CGA-4vpr-q7q8-45rq","CGA-5cp6-wm6x-6hh6","CGA-5v8x-j4fr-5h89","CGA-77hv-73ff-6p3m","CGA-7h72-423x-qhqr","CGA-7hv3-6gvw-jfj8","CGA-7rp2-pxrc-m6j6","CGA-8h2p-j7jc-r2wp","CGA-9fm9-vjjx-mf36","CGA-cc96-f268-ww84","CGA-f8ph-q5fp-5wr6","CGA-fxj3-vmqj-rf6g","CGA-g4h7-8whc-6fqq","CGA-gfh3-6776-2vgq","CGA-gv57-w86f-7xwv","CGA-h2qv-wgxw-vgg3","CGA-h74q-3jxh-cgx8","CGA-hfh9-h79c-6gr9","CGA-hxpj-j9j6-83g3","CGA-m5p6-prv7-5gp8","CGA-p33v-c452-5cqq","CGA-vjfj-c95x-wm93","CGA-xc88-5jwg-v32r","CGA-xhw2-37v3-58vp"],"summary":"Some AES functions may panic when overflow checking is enabled in ring","details":"`ring::aead::quic::HeaderProtectionKey::new_mask()` may panic when overflow checking is enabled.

This allows bypass of signature verification in cases where coreos-installer decompresses a downloaded OS image, allowing an attacker who can modify the OS image to compromise a newly-installed system.\n\nDefault installations from ISO or PXE media in Fedora CoreOS, RHEL CoreOS, and RHEL for Edge are **not** affected, as coreos-installer installs from an OS image shipped as part of the install media.\n\nThese flows are affected:\n\n1.  Installing with `--image-file`, `--image-url`, or `coreos.inst.image_url`.  For example, if a user has a local mirror of installation images, an attacker could replace an image with a gzip-compressed alternative (even if the file extension is `.xz`).  The result:\n\n    ```\n    $ coreos-installer install --image-url http://localhost:8080/image.xz /dev/loop0\n    Downloading image from http://localhost:8080/image.xz\n    Downloading signature from http://localhost:8080/image.xz.sig\n    > Read disk 749.9 MiB/749.9 MiB (100%)\n    gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Sep 2021 02:41:50 PM EDT\n    gpg: using RSA key 8C5BA6990BDB26E19F2A1A801161AE6945719A39\n    gpg: BAD signature from \"Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>\" [ultimate]\n    Install complete.\n    ```\n\n    Notice that GPG reports a bad signature, but coreos-installer continues anyway.  Automation that relies on coreos-installer's exit status will not notice either.\n\n2. `coreos-installer download --decompress --image-url`:\n\n    ```\n    $ coreos-installer download --decompress --image-url http://localhost:8080/image.xz\n    > Read disk 749.9 MiB/749.9 MiB (100%)\n    gpg: Signature made Mon 20 Sep 2021 02:41:50 PM EDT\n    gpg: using RSA key 8C5BA6990BDB26E19F2A1A801161AE6945719A39\n    gpg: BAD signature from \"Fedora (34) <fedora-34-primary@fedoraproject.org>\" [ultimate]\n    ./image\n    ```\n\n    Again, coreos-installer reports success.\n\n3. Installing with default parameters, when **not** installing from the image built into live ISO or PXE media, if the hosting service is compromised or if an active attacker gains control of the HTTPS response.\n\n4. `coreos-installer download --decompress` if the hosting service is compromised or if an active attacker gains control of the HTTPS response.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability is [fixed](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/pull/659) in coreos-installer 0.10.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor `coreos-installer download`, do not use the `-d` or `--decompress` options.\n\nFor `coreos-installer install`, manually inspect the stderr output.  If `BAD signature` appears, do not boot from the target disk.  Note, however, that some OS services may have already accessed data on the compromised disk.\n\n### References\n\nFor more information, see [PR 655](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/pull/655).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, [open an issue in coreos-installer](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/issues/new/choose) or email the CoreOS [development mailing list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/coreos@lists.fedoraproject.org/).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"coreos-installer","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/coreos-installer"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.10.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/10/GHSA-3r3g-g73x-g593/GHSA-3r3g-g73x-g593.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/security/advisories/GHSA-3r3g-g73x-g593"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20319"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/pull/655"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/pull/659/commits/ad243c6f0eff2835b2da56ca5f7f33af76253c89"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2011862"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0103.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-347"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-10-11T21:17:04Z","nvd_published_at":"2022-03-04T18:15:00Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.193657Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-vx24-x4mv-vwr5","published":"2024-07-26T21:24:18Z","modified":"2025-12-22T16:44:26.461289Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-41815","RUSTSEC-2024-0446"],"summary":"Starship vulnerable to shell injection via undocumented, unpredictable shell expansion in custom commands","details":"## Description \nStarship is a cross-shell prompt.

The crate name was intentionally similar to the name of the\npopular [`rust_decimal`][2] crate, hoping that potential victims would misspell\nits name (an attack called \"typosquatting\").\n\nTo protect the security of the ecosystem, the crates.io team permanently\nremoved the crate from the registry as soon as it was made aware of the\nmalware. An analysis of all the crates on crates.io was also performed, and no\nother crate with similar code patterns was found.\n\nKeep in mind that the [`rust_decimal`][2] crate was **not** compromised, and it\nis still safe to use.\n\n## Analysis of the crate\n\nThe crate had less than 500 downloads since its first release on 2022-03-25,\nand no crates on the crates.io registry depended on it.\n\nThe crate contained identical source code and functionality as the legit\n`rust_decimal` crate, except for the `Decimal::new` function.\n\nWhen the function was called, it checked whether the `GITLAB_CI` environment\nvariable was set, and if so it downloaded a binary payload into\n`/tmp/git-updater.bin` and executed it. The binary payload supported both Linux\nand macOS, but not for Windows.\n\nAn analysis of the binary payload was not possible, as the download URL didn't\nwork anymore when the analysis was performed.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nIf your project or organization is running GitLab CI, we strongly recommend\nchecking whether your project or one of its dependencies depended on the\n`rustdecimal` crate, starting from 2022-03-25. If you notice a dependency on\nthat crate, you should consider your CI environment to be compromised.\n\nIn general, we recommend regularly auditing your dependencies, and only\ndepending on crates whose author you trust. If you notice any suspicious\nbehavior in a crate's source code please follow [the Rust security\npolicy][3] and report it to the Rust Security Response WG.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe want to thank GitHub user [`@safinaskar`][4] for identifying the\nmalicious crate in [this GitHub issue][1].\n\n[1]: https://github.com/paupino/rust-decimal/issues/514#issuecomment-1115408888\n[2]: https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal\n[3]: https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security\n[4]: https://github.com/safinaskar","affected":[{"package":{"name":"rustdecimal","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/rustdecimal"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["code-execution"],"cvss":null,"informational":null,"source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2022-0042.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/rustdecimal"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0042.html"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://groups.google.com/g/rustlang-security-announcements/c/5DVtC8pgJLw?pli=1"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.259868Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2021-0082","published":"2021-08-14T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-12-17T17:18:32.343835Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-45680","GHSA-jmwx-r3gq-qq3p","GHSA-x76r-966h-5qv9"],"summary":"vec-const attempts to construct a Vec from a pointer to a const slice","details":"Affected versions of this crate claimed to construct a const `Vec` with nonzero length and capacity, but that cannot be done because such a `Vec` requires a pointer from an allocator.\n\nThe implementation was later changed to just construct a `std::borrow::Cow`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vec-const","ecosystem":"crates.io","purl":"pkg:cargo/vec-const"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.0.0-0"},{"fixed":"2.0.0"}]}],"ecosystem_specific":{"affected_functions":null,"affects":{"arch":[],"functions":[],"os":[]}},"database_specific":{"categories":["memory-corruption"],"cvss":null,"informational":"unsound","source":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/RUSTSEC-2021-0082.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://crates.io/crates/vec-const"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0082.html"},{"type":"REPORT","url":"https://github.com/Eolu/vec-const/issues/1#issuecomment-898908241"}],"database_specific":{"license":"CC0-1.0"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-25T18:21:35.255477Z","source":"crates-io","ecosystem":"crates.io"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"RUSTSEC-2025-0136","published":"2025-11-07T12:00:00Z","modified":"2025-12-17T06:16:23.047289Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-67897","GHSA-v6x3-9r38-r27q"],"summary":"Underflow in aes_key_unwrap function","details":"The `aes_key_unwrap` function would panic if passed a ciphertext\nthat was too short.

It was discovered recently that when we deallocate a node, in some cases only the first memory chunk is deallocated, and the rest of the memory chunks remain (incorrectly) allocated, causing a memory leak.\n\nIn the worst case, depending on how a canister uses the `BTreeMap`, an adversary could interact with the canister through its API and trigger interactions with the map that keep consuming memory due to the memory leak. This could potentially lead to using an excessive amount of memory, or even running out of memory. \n\nThis issue has been fixed in #212 by changing the logic for deallocating nodes to ensure that all of a node's memory chunks are deallocated.
