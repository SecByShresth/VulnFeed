Proof-of-Work Vulnerable to Challenge Splicing and Replay","details":"### Impact\n\nA cryptographic semantic binding flaw in ALTCHA libraries allows challenge payload splicing, which may enable replay attacks. The HMAC signature does not unambiguously bind challenge parameters to the nonce, allowing an attacker to reinterpret a valid proof-of-work submission with a modified expiration value. This may allow previously solved challenges to be reused beyond their intended lifetime, depending on server-side replay handling and deployment assumptions.\n\nThe vulnerability primarily impacts abuse-prevention mechanisms such as rate limiting and bot mitigation. It does not directly affect data confidentiality or integrity. \n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been addressed by enforcing explicit semantic separation between challenge parameters and the nonce during HMAC computation.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to patched versions.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a mitigation, implementations may append a delimiter to the end of the `salt` value prior to HMAC computation (for example, `<salt>?expires=<time>&`). This prevents ambiguity between parameters and the nonce and is backward-compatible with existing implementations, as the delimiter is treated as a standard URL parameter separator.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"altcha-lib","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/altcha-lib"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959.json"}},{"package":{"name":"altcha-org/altcha","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/altcha-org/altcha"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.3.1"}]}],"versions":["v0.1.0","v0.1.1","v0.1.2","v0.1.3","v0.1.4","v1.0.0","v1.1.0","v1.1.1","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.3.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959.json"}},{"package":{"name":"github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-go","ecosystem":"Go","purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-go"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.altcha:altcha","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.altcha/altcha"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.3.0"}]}],"versions":["1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959.json"}},{"package":{"name":"altcha","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/altcha"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.2.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959.json"}},{"package":{"name":"altcha","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/altcha"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959.json"}},{"package":{"name":"altcha","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/altcha"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib/security/advisories/GHSA-6gvq-jcmp-8959"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68113"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-ex/commit/09b2bad466ad0338a5b24245380950ea9918333e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-go/commit/4a5610745ef79895a67bac858b2e4f291c2614b8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-java/commit/69277651fdd6418ae10bf3a088901506f9c62114"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-php/commit/9e9e70c864a9db960d071c77c778be0c9ff1a4d0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-rb/commit/4fd7b64cbbfc713f3ca4e066c2dd466e3b8d359b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib/commit/cb95d83a8d08e273b6be15e48988e7eaf60d5c08"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-java/releases/tag/v1.3.0"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib-php/releases/tag/v1.3.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-lib/releases/tag/1.4.1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/altcha/CVE-2025-68113.yml"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-115","CWE-347"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-16T00:43:52Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-16T01:15:53Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T12:31:05.525717Z","source":"hex","ecosystem":"Hex"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3cjh-p6pw-jhv9","published":"2023-09-19T17:00:08Z","modified":"2025-12-10T00:58:47.685114Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-42446"],"summary":"Pow Mnesia cache doesn't invalidate all expired keys on startup","details":"Use of `Pow.Store.Backend.MnesiaCache` is susceptible to session hijacking as expired keys are not being invalidated correctly on startup.

The `before_action` could run a sensitive/expensive operation.\n\n### Impact\nA malicious user could cause a `before_action` to run even though they are not authorized to perform the whole action.\n\nYou are affected if you have an create, update or destroy action that:\n\n- has a before_transaction hook on it, and no after_transaction hook on it.\n- is being used via an `Ash.bulk_*` callback (which AshJsonApi and AshGraphql do for update/destroy actions)\n\nWhether or not or how much it matters depends on the nature of those before_transaction callbacks. If those before_transaction callbacks are side-effectful, or just doing something like looking up some external data. If your API endpoints are behind authentication and what kind. \n\n### Severity\n\nThe severity for this was hard to gauge. `before_transaction` hooks are not that commonly used. Additionally, any attacker must know which of these things are available to them, be authenticated to make such a request (i.e you very rarely have policies preventing the running of anonymous queries), so privileges and inside knowledge are required. Additionally, the action will always return a `forbidden` error, so no information is revealed. We will evaluate and adjust the severity in the next few days as needed.\n\nIt is currently marked as High, given that we really don't know what logic folks are putting in their before_transaction hooks and it could theoretically be very bad.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou should update ASAP, but if for whatever reason you cannot update, you can add logic to those before_transaction hooks to prevent

has email link auto-click account confirmation vulnerability","details":"### Impact\n\nThe confirmation flow for account creation currently uses a GET request triggered by clicking a link sent via email. Some email clients and security tools (e.g., Outlook, virus scanners, and email previewers) may automatically follow these links, unintentionally confirming the account. This allows an attacker to register an account using another user’s email and potentially have it auto-confirmed by the victim’s email client.\n\nThis does not allow attackers to take over or access existing accounts or private data. It is limited to account confirmation of new accounts only.\n\n### Patches\nA mitigation has been released in version `4.7.0`. You will also need to upgrade to `2.6.0` or later of `ash_authentication_phoenix` to take advantage of the autogenerated views for confirmation. The fix updates the confirmation flow to require explicit user interaction (such as clicking a button on the confirmation page) rather than performing the confirmation via a GET request. This ensures that automatic link prefetching or scanning by email clients does not unintentionally confirm accounts.\n\nTo mitigate, follow these steps:\n\n1. Upgrade `ash_authentication` >= `4.7.0`\n2. Upgrade `ash_authentication_phoenix` >= `2.6.0` (if using `ash_authentication_phoenix`)\n3. Set `require_interaction? true` in your confirmation strategy.\n4. Add `confirm_route` to your router, if using `ash_authentication_phoenix` *above* `auth_routes`.\n\n#### Setting `require_interaction? true`\n\nmodify your `confirmation` strategy like so:\n\n```elixir\nconfirmation <strategy_name> do\n  ...\n  require_interaction? true\nend\n```\n\n#### Adding the `confirm_route` to your router\n\nIn order to use this new confirmation flow, you will need to add this to your router to get the desired behavior. It will add a new route to the new confirmation page LiveView. Note the `path` and `token_as_route_param?` options, required for keeping backwards compatibility with current defaults. You may need to adjust if you have changed those routes in some way.\n\n##### IMPORTANT - above `auth_routes`\n\nMake sure this goes *above* `auth_routes` if you are using the `path` option, and it begins with `/auth`,\nor whatever your configured `auth_routes_prefix` is. `auth_routes` greedily handles all routes at the\nconfigured path.\n\n```elixir\nconfirm_route(\n  MyApp.Accounts.User,\n  <confirmation_strategy_name>,\n  auth_routes_prefix: \"/auth\",\n  overrides: [MyAppWeb.AuthOverrides, AshAuthentication.Phoenix.Overrides.Default],\n  # use these options to keep your currently issued confirmation emails compatible\n  # without the options below, the route will default to `/<the_strategy_name>/:token`\n  path: \"/auth/user/<confirmation_strategy_name>\",\n  token_as_route_param?: false\n)\n```\n\nUsers should upgrade to version `4.7.0` as soon as possible, and set `require_interaction?` to `true` in their confirmation strategy. This will change the `GET` request generated for confirming to a `POST` request. \n\nIf you upgrade to this version and do not set `require_interaction?` to `true`, compilation will be fail with a message linking to this advisory. This error can be bypassed if, for example, you are confident that you are not affected.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\nYou can disable the confirmation routes and create your own live view. We highly advised that you upgrade and take advantage of the builtin views if possible. If you are not using the provided views, you will need to *add* a confirmation LiveView, that does a `POST` to the old confirmation url instead of a `GET`. You would do this by taking the token a parameter out of the link, and adding it as a hidden field to a form. That form would have no inputs, only a button that posts to the confirmation URL. If you are using Liveview, this would be done with `phx-trigger-action` and `phx-action`.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ash_authentication","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/ash_authentication"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.7.0"}]}],"versions":["3.0.3","3.1.0","3.10.0","3.10.1","3.10.2","3.10.3","3.10.4","3.10.5","3.10.6","3.10.7","3.10.8","3.11.0","3.11.1","3.11.10","3.11.11","3.11.12","3.11.13","3.11.14","3.11.15","3.11.16","3.11.2","3.11.3","3.11.4","3.11.5","3.11.6","3.11.7","3.11.8","3.11.9","3.12.0","3.12.1","3.12.2","3.12.3","3.12.4","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.2","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.5.2","3.5.3","3.6.0","3.6.1","3.7.0","3.7.1","3.7.2","3.7.3","3.7.4","3.7.5","3.7.6","3.7.8","3.7.9","3.8.0","3.9.0","3.9.1","3.9.2","3.9.3","3.9.4","3.9.5","3.9.6","4.0.0","4.0.0-rc.0","4.0.0-rc.1","4.0.0-rc.2","4.0.0-rc.3","4.0.0-rc.5","4.0.0-rc.6","4.0.1","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.1.0","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.2.5","4.2.6","4.2.7","4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.10","4.3.11","4.3.12","4.3.2","4.3.3","4.3.4","4.3.5","4.3.6","4.3.7","4.3.8","4.3.9","4.4.0","4.4.1","4.4.2","4.4.3","4.4.4","4.4.5","4.4.6","4.4.7","4.4.8","4.4.9","4.5.0","4.5.1","4.5.2","4.5.3","4.5.4","4.5.5","4.5.6","4.6.0","4.6.1","4.6.2","4.6.3","4.6.4"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/04/GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787/GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/security/advisories/GHSA-3988-q8q7-p787"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32782"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication/commit/99ea38977fd4f421d2aaae0c2fb29f8e5f8f707d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-306"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-04-14T23:00:39Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-04-15T22:15:28Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T12:31:05.525226Z","source":"hex","ecosystem":"Hex"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-p8f7-22gq-m7j9","published":"2022-10-17T12:00:27Z","modified":"2025-12-10T00:41:50.913655Z","aliases":["CVE-2022-42975"],"summary":"Phoenix before 1.6.14 mishandles check_origin wildcarding","details":"socket/transport.ex in Phoenix before 1.6.14 mishandles check_origin wildcarding.

has authorization bypass when bypass policy condition evaluates to true","details":"### Summary\nBypass policies incorrectly authorize requests when their condition evaluates to true but their authorization checks fail and no other policies apply.\n\n### Impact\nResources with bypass policies can be accessed without proper authorization when:\n- Bypass condition evaluates to true\n- Bypass authorization checks fail\n- Other policies exist but their conditions don't match\n\n### Details\nVulnerable code in: [lib/ash/policy/policy.ex:69](https://github.com/ash-project/ash/blob/b2e4d625/lib/ash/policy/policy.ex#L69)\n\n```elixir\n{%{bypass?: true}, cond_expr, complete_expr}, {one_condition_matches, all_policies_match} ->\n  {\n    b(cond_expr or one_condition_matches),  # <- Bug: uses condition only\n    b(complete_expr or all_policies_match)\n  }\n```\n\nThe final authorization decision is: `one_condition_matches AND all_policies_match`\n\nWhen a bypass condition is true but bypass policies fail, and subsequent policies have non-matching conditions:\n\n1. **one_condition_matches** = `cond_expr` (bypass condition) = **true** (bug - should check if bypass actually authorizes)\n2. **all_policies_match** = `(complete_expr OR NOT cond_expr)` for each policy\n   - For non-matching policies: `(false OR NOT false)` = **true** (policies don't apply)\n3. **Final**: `true AND true` = **true** (incorrectly authorized)\n\nThe bypass condition alone satisfies \"at least one policy applies\" even though the bypass fails to authorize.\n\n### Fix\nReplace `cond_expr` with `complete_expr` on line 69:\n```elixir\n{%{bypass?: true}, _cond_expr, complete_expr}, {one_condition_matches, all_policies_match} ->\n  {\n    b(complete_expr or one_condition_matches),  # <- Fixed\n    b(complete_expr or all_policies_match)\n  }\n```\n\nLine 52 should also be updated for consistency (though it's only triggered when bypass is the last policy, making it coincidentally safe in practice):\n```elixir\n{%{bypass?: true}, _cond_expr, complete_expr}, {one_condition_matches, true} ->\n  {\n    b(complete_expr or one_condition_matches),  # <- For consistency\n    complete_expr\n  }\n```\n\n### PoC\n```elixir\npolicies do\n  bypass always() do\n    authorize_if actor_attribute_equals(:is_admin, true)\n  end\n\n  policy action_type(:read) do\n    authorize_if always()\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNon-admin user can perform create actions (should be denied).\n\nTest demonstrating the bug:\n```elixir\ntest \"bypass policy bug\" do\n  policies = [\n    %Ash.Policy.Policy{\n      bypass?: true,\n      condition: [{Ash.Policy.Check.Static, result: true}],  # condition = true\n      policies: [\n        %Ash.Policy.Check{\n          type: :authorize_if,\n          check: {Ash.Policy.Check.Static, result: false},  # policies = false\n          check_module:

false}],\n      policies: [\n        %Ash.Policy.Check{\n          type: :authorize_if,\n          check: {Ash.Policy.Check.Static, result: true},\n          check_module: Ash.Policy.Check.Static,\n

Who is impacted?_\n\nIn certain *very specific* situations, it was possible for the policies of an update action to be skipped. This occurred only on \"empty\" update actions (no changing fields), and would allow their hooks (side effects) to be performed when they should not have been. Note that this does not allow reading new data that the user should not have had access to, only triggering a side effect a user should not have been able to trigger.\n\nYou must have an update action that:\n\n- Is on a resource with no attributes containing an \"update default\" (updated_at timestamp, for example)\n- can be performed atomically. \n- Does *not* have `require_atomic? false`\n- Has at least one authorizer (typically `Ash.Policy.Authorizer`)\n- Has at least one `change` (on the resource's `changes` block or in the action itself)\n  This is where the side-effects would be performed when they should not have been.\n\n--- \n\n- Is there ever a place where you call this action manually, using `Ash.update`. \n   Note that AshGraphql and AshJsonApi action calls are *not* affected as they use `Ash.bulk_update`.   \n- If so, is there ever a case where you call the action with zero inputs, and have it produce zero changing fields.\n- If so, could it then produce a side effect. This means you'd have an after_action hook that calls some other resource.\n- If so, does that side effect bypass another resource's policies, i.e using `authorize?: false`, or not providing the same actor.\n\n\nEverything above the line can be checked with the provided script. Everything below it, must be checked manually. The script for checking this is available in the \"Might I be affected\" section. \n\n**The script can have false *positives*, but will not have any false *negatives*. So if you run the script, and it says \"No potential vulnerabilities found\", then all you need to do is update ash_postgres.** \n\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in `2.4.10` of `ash_postgres`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou could:\n\n1. Determine that none of your actions are vulnerable using the script.\n2. Add `require_atomic? false` to any potentially affected update action\n3. Replace any usage of `Ash.update` with `Ash.bulk_update` for an affected action\n4. add an update timestamp to your action.\n\n### Might I be affected\n\nThis gist provides a script you can run to detect if you are potentially vulnerable.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/zachdaniel/e49166b765978c48dfaf998d06df436e\n\n### References\n\nOriginal Report/discovery:

Framework: Filter authorization misapplies impossible bypass/runtime policies","details":"### Summary\n\nWhen using **filter** authorization, two edge cases could cause the policy compiler/authorizer to generate a permissive filter:\n\n1. **Bypass policies whose condition can never pass at runtime** were compiled as\n   `OR(AND(condition, compiled_policies), NOT(condition))`.\n   If the condition could never be true at runtime, the `NOT(condition)` branch evaluated truthy and the overall expression became permissive.\n\n2. **Runtime policy scenarios that reduce to “no checks are applicable”** (an empty SAT scenario) were treated as an empty clause and dropped instead of being treated as **`false`**, which could again produce an overly broad (permissive) filter.\n\nThese bugs could allow reads to return records that should have been excluded by policy.\n\n### Impact\n\nProjects that rely on **filter-based authorization** and define:\n\n* `bypass ... do ... end` blocks whose condition(s) are only resolvable at runtime and can never pass in a given request context, **or**\n* runtime checks that simplify to an **empty** scenario for a clause\n\nmay unintentionally generate a permissive query filter, potentially returning unauthorized data.\n\n*Actions primarily affected:* reads guarded by filter policies. Non-filter (e.g., hard forbid) policies are not impacted.\n\n### Technical details\n\nThis patch corrects two behaviors:\n\n* **`Ash.Policy.Policy.compile_policy_expression/1`** now treats **bypass** blocks as\n  `AND(condition_expression, compiled_policies)`\n  instead of `OR(AND(...), NOT(condition_expression))`. This removes the permissive `NOT(condition)` escape hatch when a bypass condition never passes.\n\n* **`Ash.Policy.Authorizer`** now treats **empty SAT scenarios** (`scenario == %{}`) as **`false`**, ensuring impossible scenarios do not collapse into a no-op and inadvertently widen the filter. The reducer also normalizes `nil` → `false` consistently when building `auto_filter` fragments.\n\nRelevant changes are in:\n\n* `lib/ash/policy/policy.ex` (bypass compilation)\n* `lib/ash/policy/authorizer/authorizer.ex` (scenario handling / auto_filter normalization)\n* Tests added: `test/policy/filter_condition_test.exs` (`RuntimeFalsyCheck`, `RuntimeBypassResource`) validate the corrected behavior.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Avoid `bypass` policies whose conditions are only decidable at runtime and may be perpetually false in some contexts; prefer explicit `authorize_if`/`forbid_if` blocks without `bypass` for those cases.\n* Add an explicit **final `forbid_if always()`** guard for sensitive reads as a belt-and-suspenders fallback until user can upgrade.\n* Where feasible, replace runtime-unknown checks with strict/compile-time checks or restructure to avoid empty SAT scenarios.\n\n### How to tell if user is affected\n\nUser is likely affected if ALL of the following are true:\n\n*  Uses **filter authorization**; and\n* Defines `bypass` block with `access_type :runtime` without any policies after it; or\n* Defines `bypass` blocks whose conditions are evaluated at runtime (e.g., checks with `strict_check/3` returning `:unknown` and a runtime `check/4` that may never succeed in some contexts) without any policies after it\n\nA quick sanity test is to issue a read expected to return **no** rows under such a bypass or runtime-falsy condition and verify it indeed returns `[]`. The included test `bypass works with filter policies` demonstrates the corrected, non-permissive behavior.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ash","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/ash"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.2"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.1.3","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.10.0","0.12.0","0.13.0","0.13.1","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.6.5","0.7.0","0.8.0","0.9.0","0.9.1","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.1.0","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.10.0","1.11.0","1.11.1","1.12.0","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.13.3","1.13.4","1.14.0","1.15.0","1.15.1","1.16.2","1.17.0","1.17.1","1.18.0","1.18.1","1.19.0","1.19.1","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.20.0","1.20.1","1.22.0","1.22.1","1.23.0","1.23.1","1.23.2","1.23.3","1.24.0","1.24.1","1.24.2","1.25.0","1.25.1","1.25.2","1.25.3","1.25.4","1.25.5","1.25.6","1.25.7","1.25.8","1.26.0","1.26.1","1.26.10","1.26.11","1.26.12","1.26.13","1.26.2","1.26.4","1.26.5","1.26.6","1.26.7","1.26.8","1.26.9","1.27.0","1.27.1","1.28.0","1.28.1","1.29.0-rc0","1.29.0-rc1","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.30.1","1.30.2","1.31.0","1.31.1","1.32.0","1.32.1","1.32.2","1.33.0","1.34.0","1.34.1","1.34.2","1.34.3","1.34.4","1.34.5","1.34.6","1.34.7","1.34.8","1.34.9","1.35.0","1.35.1","1.36.0","1.36.10","1.36.11","1.36.12","1.36.13","1.36.14","1.36.15","1.36.16","1.36.17","1.36.18","1.36.19","1.36.2","1.36.21","1.36.22","1.36.3","1.36.4","1.36.5","1.36.6","1.36.7","1.36.8","1.36.9","1.37.0","1.37.1","1.37.2","1.38.0","1.39.0","1.39.1","1.39.2","1.39.3","1.39.4","1.39.5","1.39.6","1.39.7","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.40.0","1.41.0","1.41.1","1.41.10","1.41.11","1.41.12","1.41.2","1.41.3","1.41.4","1.41.5","1.41.6","1.41.7","1.41.8","1.41.9","1.42.0","1.43.0","1.43.1","1.43.10","1.43.11","1.43.12","1.43.2","1.43.3","1.43.4","1.43.5","1.43.6","1.43.7","1.43.8","1.43.9","1.44.0","1.44.1","1.44.10","1.44.11","1.44.12","1.44.13","1.44.2","1.44.3","1.44.4","1.44.5","1.44.6","1.44.7","1.44.8","1.44.9","1.45.0-rc0","1.45.0-rc1","1.45.0-rc10","1.45.0-rc11","1.45.0-rc12","1.45.0-rc13","1.45.0-rc14","1.45.0-rc15","1.45.0-rc16","1.45.0-rc17","1.45.0-rc18","1.45.0-rc19","1.45.0-rc2","1.45.0-rc20","1.45.0-rc3","1.45.0-rc4","1.45.0-rc5","1.45.0-rc6","1.45.0-rc7","1.45.0-rc8","1.45.0-rc9","1.46.0","1.46.1","1.46.10","1.46.11","1.46.12","1.46.13","1.46.2","1.46.3","1.46.4","1.46.5","1.46.6","1.46.7","1.46.8","1.46.9","1.47.0","1.47.1","1.47.10","1.47.11","1.47.12","1.47.2","1.47.3","1.47.4","1.47.5","1.47.6","1.47.7","1.47.8","1.47.9","1.48.0-rc.0","1.48.0-rc.1","1.48.0-rc.10","1.48.0-rc.11","1.48.0-rc.12","1.48.0-rc.13","1.48.0-rc.14","1.48.0-rc.15","1.48.0-rc.16","1.48.0-rc.17","1.48.0-rc.18","1.48.0-rc.19","1.48.0-rc.2","1.48.0-rc.20","1.48.0-rc.21","1.48.0-rc.22","1.48.0-rc.23","1.48.0-rc.24","1.48.0-rc.25","1.48.0-rc.26","1.48.0-rc.27","1.48.0-rc.28","1.48.0-rc.29","1.48.0-rc.3","1.48.0-rc.30","1.48.0-rc.4","1.48.0-rc.5","1.48.0-rc.6","1.48.0-rc.7","1.48.0-rc.8","1.48.0-rc.9","1.49.0","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.50.0","1.50.1","1.50.10","1.50.11","1.50.12","1.50.13","1.50.14","1.50.15","1.50.16","1.50.17","1.50.18","1.50.19","1.50.2","1.50.20","1.50.21","1.50.3","1.50.4","1.50.5","1.50.6","1.50.7","1.50.8","1.50.9","1.51.0","1.51.1","1.51.2","1.52.0-rc.0","1.52.0-rc.1","1.52.0-rc.10","1.52.0-rc.11","1.52.0-rc.12","1.52.0-rc.13","1.52.0-rc.14","1.52.0-rc.15","1.52.0-rc.16","1.52.0-rc.17","1.52.0-rc.18","1.52.0-rc.19","1.52.0-rc.2","1.52.0-rc.20","1.52.0-rc.21","1.52.0-rc.22","1.52.0-rc.3","1.52.0-rc.4","1.52.0-rc.5","1.52.0-rc.6","1.52.0-rc.7","1.52.0-rc.8","1.52.0-rc.9","1.53.0","1.53.2","1.53.3","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.6.7","1.6.8","1.7.0","1.8.0","1.9.0","2.0.0","2.0.0-pre.0","2.0.0-pre.1","2.0.0-pre.2","2.0.0-pre.3","2.0.0-pre.4","2.0.0-pre.5","2.0.0-pre.6","2.0.0-pre.7","2.0.0-pre.8","2.0.0-rc.0","2.0.0-rc.1","2.0.0-rc.10","2.0.0-rc.11","2.0.0-rc.12","2.0.0-rc.13","2.0.0-rc.14","2.0.0-rc.15","2.0.0-rc.2","2.0.0-rc.3","2.0.0-rc.4","2.0.0-rc.5","2.0.0-rc.6","2.0.0-rc.7","2.0.0-rc.8","2.0.0-rc.9","2.1.0","2.10.0","2.10.1","2.10.2","2.11.0","2.11.0-rc.0","2.11.0-rc.1","2.11.0-rc.2","2.11.0-rc.3","2.11.1","2.11.10","2.11.11","2.11.2","2.11.3","2.11.4","2.11.5","2.11.6","2.11.7","2.11.8","2.11.9","2.12.0","2.12.1","2.13.0","2.13.1","2.13.2","2.13.3","2.13.4","2.14.0","2.14.1","2.14.10","2.14.11","2.14.12","2.14.13","2.14.14","2.14.15","2.14.16","2.14.17","2.14.18","2.14.19","2.14.2","2.14.20","2.14.21","2.14.3","2.14.4","2.14.5","2.14.6","2.14.7","2.14.8","2.14.9","2.15.0","2.15.1","2.15.10","2.15.11","2.15.12","2.15.13","2.15.14","2.15.15","2.15.16","2.15.17","2.15.18","2.15.19","2.15.2","2.15.20","2.15.4","2.15.5","2.15.6","2.15.7","2.15.8","2.15.9","2.16.0","2.16.1","2.17.0","2.17.1","2.17.10","2.17.11","2.17.12","2.17.13","2.17.14","2.17.15","2.17.16","2.17.17","2.17.18","2.17.19","2.17.2","2.17.20","2.17.21","2.17.22","2.17.23","2.17.24","2.17.3","2.17.4","2.17.5","2.17.6","2.17.7","2.17.8","2.17.9","2.18.0","2.18.1","2.18.2","2.19.0","2.19.1","2.19.10","2.19.11","2.19.12","2.19.13","2.19.14","2.19.2","2.19.3","2.19.4","2

In addition, Stark Bank maintains a number of cryptographic libraries to perform cryptographic signing and verification. These popular libraries are meant to be used to integrate with the Stark Bank ecosystem, but are also accessible on popular package manager platforms in order to be used by other projects. The node package manager reports around 16k weekly downloads for the [ecdsa-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/starkbank-ecdsa ) implementation while the Python implementation boasts over [7.3M downloads in the last 90 days on PyPI](https://package.wiki/starkbank-ecdsa). A number of these libraries suffer from a vulnerability in the signature verification functions, allowing attackers to forge signatures for arbitrary messages which successfully verify with any public key.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can forge signatures on arbitrary messages that will verify for any public key. This may allow attackers to authenticate as any user within the Stark Bank platform, and bypass signature verification needed to perform operations on the platform, such as send payments and transfer funds. Additionally, the ability for attackers to forge signatures may impact other users and projects using these libraries in different and unforeseen ways.\n\n### Details\nThe (slightly simplified) ECDSA verification of a signature _**(r, s)**_ on a hashed message _**z**_ with public key _**Q**_ and curve order _**n**_ works as follows:\n\nThe (slightly simplified) ECDSA verification of a signature _**(r, s)**_ on a hashed message _**z**_ with public key _**Q**_ and curve order _**n**_ works as follows:\n\n- Check that _**r**_ and _**s**_ are integers in the _**[1, n-1]**_ range, return Invalid if not.\n- Compute _**u<sub>1</sub> = zs<sup>-1</sup> mod n**_ and _**u<sub>2</sub> = rs<sup>-1</sup> mod n**_.\n- Compute the elliptic curve point _**(x, y) = u<sub>1</sub>G + u<sub>2</sub>Q**_, return Invalid if _**(x, y)**_ is the point at infinity.\n- Return Valid if _**r ≡ x mod n**_, Invalid otherwise.\n\nThe ECDSA signature verification functions in the libraries listed above fail to perform the first check, ensuring that the r and s components of the signatures are in the correct range. Specifically, the libraries are not checking that the components of the signature are non-zero, which is an important check mandated by the standard, see X9.62:2005, Section 7.4.1/a:\n\n> 1. If _**r’**_ is not an integer in the interval _**[1, n-1]**_, then reject the signature.\n> 2. If _**s’**_ is not an integer in the interval _**[1, n-1]**_, then reject the signature.\n\nFor example, consider the following excerpt of the verify function from the [ecdsa-python implementation](https://github.com/starkbank/ecdsa-python/blob/v2.0.0/ellipticcurve/ecdsa.py#L34-L41).\n\n```python\ndef verify(cls, message, signature, publicKey, hashfunc=sha256):\n    byteMessage = hashfunc(toBytes(message)).digest()\n    numberMessage = numberFromByteString(byteMessage)\n    curve = publicKey.curve\n    r = signature.r\n    s = signature.s\n    inv = Math.inv(s, curve.N)\n    u1 = Math.multiply(curve.G, n=(numberMessage * inv) % curve.N, N=curve.N, A=curve.A, P=curve.P)\n    u2 = Math.multiply(publicKey.point, n=(r * inv) % curve.N, N=curve.N, A=curve.A, P=curve.P)\n    add = Math.add(u1, u2, A=curve.A, P=curve.P)\n    modX = add.x % curve.N\n    return r == modX\n```\n\nIn that code snippet, the values `r` and `s` are extracted from the signature without any range check. An attacker supplying a signature equal to `(r, s) = (0, 0)` will not see their signature rejected. Proceeding with the verification, this function computes the inverse of the `s` component. Note that the `Math.inv()` function returns zero when supplied with a zero input (even though 0 does not admit an inverse). The code then computes the values `u1 = inv * numberMessage * G` and `u2 = inv * r * Q`, but since `inv` is zero, `u1` and `u2` will both be zero, i.e., the point at infinity, regardless of the value of numberMessage (the message hash, which we called _**z**_ above) and _**Q**_ (the public key). Subsequently, the implementation computes the intermediary curve point add by adding up the two previously computed points, which again results in the point at infinity.

If you did not use the new installer, then you are absolutely not affected.\n\nAdditionally, unless you have implemented any kind of custom token revocation feature in your application (in which case even cursory testing would have uncovered this issue), then you will not be significantly affected. \n\nThe impact here for users is as follows:\n\n  - For users using the magic link strategy, magic link tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. By default magic link tokens are valid for 10 minutes.\n  - For users of password resets in the password strategy, password reset tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. By default password reset tokens are valid for 3 days.\n  - For users of the confirmation add-on, confirmation tokens are reusable until they expire instead of being immediately revoked. By default password reset tokens are valid for 3 days.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe flaw is patched in version 4.4.9. Additionally a compile time warning is shown to users with remediation instructions if they upgrade. 4.4.9 ships with an upgrader, so if you use `mix igniter.upgrade ash_authentication` the necessary patch will be applied for you. Otherwise you can run the upgrader manually as described in the error message\n\n#### Example\n```elixir\n[warning] Warning while compiling Tunez.Accounts.Token:\n\nThe `:jti` and `:token` options to the `:revoked?` action must allow nil values and it must return a `:boolean`.\n\nThis was an error in our igniter installer previous to version 4.4.9, which allowed revoked tokens to be reused.\n\nTo fix this, run the following command in your shell:\n\n    mix ash_authentication.upgrade 4.4.8 4.4.9\n\nOr:\n\n  - remove `allow_nil?: false` from these action arguments, and\n  - ensure that the action returns `:boolean`.\n\n  like so:\n\n    action :revoked?, :boolean do\n      description \"Returns true if a revocation token is found for the provided token\"\n      argument :token, :string, sensitive?: true\n      argument :jti, :string, sensitive?: true\n\n      run AshAuthentication.TokenResource.IsRevoked\n    end\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDelete the generated `:revoked?` generic action in your token resource This will cause it to use the one internal to AshAuthentication which has always been correct. Alternatively,  manually make the changes described above.\n\n### References\n\nSee the `#ash_authentication` channel on the Ash

This is why the `:to` option is used for “local” URL redirects and why you must pass the `:external` option to intentionally allow external URLs to be redirected to. It has been disclosed that carefully crafted user input may be treated by some browsers as an external URL. An attacker can use this vulnerability to aid in social engineering attacks. The most common use would be to create highly believable phishing attacks. For example, the following user input would pass local URL validation, but be treated by Chrome and Firefox as external URLs: \n`http://localhost:4000/?redirect=/\\nexample.com`\nNot all browsers are affected, but latest Chrome and Firefox will issue a get request for `example.com` and successfully redirect externally","affected":[{"package":{"name":"phoenix","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/phoenix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.6"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.10.0","0.11.0","0.12.0","0.13.0","0.13.1","0.14.0","0.15.0","0.16.0","0.16.1","0.17.0","0.17.1","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.10","0.2.11","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","0.2.5","0.2.6","0.2.7","0.2.8","0.2.9","0.3.0","0.3.1","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.8.0","0.9.0","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/04/GHSA-cmfh-8f8r-fj96/GHSA-cmfh-8f8r-fj96.json"}},{"package":{"name":"phoenix","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/phoenix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.1.0"},{"fixed":"1.1.8"}]}],"versions":["1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.1.4","1.1.5","1.1.6","1.1.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/04/GHSA-cmfh-8f8r-fj96/GHSA-cmfh-8f8r-fj96.json"}},{"package":{"name":"phoenix","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/phoenix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"1.2.0"},{"fixed":"1.2.3"}]}],"versions":["1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/04/GHSA-cmfh-8f8r-fj96/GHSA-cmfh-8f8r-fj96.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000163"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://elixirforum.com/t/security-releases-for-phoenix/4143"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-04-12T21:16:09Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T12:31:05.526378Z","source":"hex","ecosystem":"Hex"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-v2wf-c3j6-wpvw","published":"2022-04-12T21:27:49Z","modified":"2025-12-10T00:28:51.752623Z","aliases":["CVE-2020-5205"],"related":["CVE-2020-5205"],"summary":"Session fixation","details":"### Impact\n\nThe use of `Plug.Session` in `Pow.Plug.Session` is susceptible to session fixation attacks if a persistent session store is used for `Plug.Session`, such as Redis or a database.

has Insufficient Session Expiration","details":"### Impact\n\nSession tokens remain valid on the server after user logout, creating a security gap where:\n\n- Compromised tokens (via XSS, network interception, or device theft) continue to work even after the user logs out\n  - The sessions stored in the database still expire, limiting the duration during which this could be exploited\n- Users cannot fully invalidate their sessions when logging out from shared or potentially compromised devices \n  - by default, changing one's password *does* invalidate all other sessions, so changing your password as a security measure would have been effective\n- May cause compliance issues with security frameworks requiring complete session \n### Patches\nUpgrade to version 2.10.0. After upgrading, users must update their AuthController implementation to use the new `clear_session/2` function with their OTP app name. You will be prompted to do so with a compile-time error.\n\nIf you do not have the setting `require_token_presence_for_authentication?` set to `true` in the `tokens` section, you will see a separate error:\n\n```\n** (Spark.Error.DslError) authentication -> session_identifier:\nMust set `authentication.session_identifier` to either `:jti` or `:unsafe`.\n\n...\n```\n\nIn order to revoke sessions on log out when not storing tokens directly in the session, we must have some unique identifier with which to do so. You should prefer to enable `require_token_presence_for_authentication?` if possible, instead of setting this to `:jti`. Note that whatever you do here, if you did not previously have `require_token_presence_for_authentication?` set to `true`, setting it to `true` *or* setting `authentication.session_identifier` to `:jti` will log out all of your currently authenticated users.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can manually revoke tokens in your `logout/2` handler in your auth controller.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ash_authentication_phoenix","ecosystem":"Hex","purl":"pkg:hex/ash_authentication_phoenix"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.10.0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.5.0","1.5.1","1.6.0","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.6.5","1.6.6","1.7.0","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.9.0","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.3","1.9.4","2.0.0","2.0.0-rc.0","2.0.0-rc.1","2.0.0-rc.2","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.10","2.1.11","2.1.2","2.1.3","2.1.4","2.1.5","2.1.6","2.1.7","2.1.8","2.1.9","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.4","2.4.5","2.4.6","2.4.7","2.4.8","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.4","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.9.0"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 2.9.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix/security/advisories/GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4754"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix/pull/634"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix/commit/a3253fb4fc7145aeb403537af1c24d3a8d51ffb1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/team-alembic/ash_authentication_phoenix"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-613"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-17T14:20:46Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-06-17T15:15:53Z","severity":"LOW"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T12:31:05.526441Z","source":"hex","ecosystem":"Hex"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"EEF-CVE-2025-4754","published":"2025-06-17T14:31:37.006Z","modified":"2025-12-10T00:27:20.076176Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-4754","GHSA-f7gq-h8jv-h3cq"],"summary":"Missing Session Revocation on Logout in ash_authentication_phoenix","details":"Insufficient Session Expiration vulnerability in ash-project ash_authentication_phoenix allows Session Hijacking.
