make free_choose_arg_map() resilient to partial allocation","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibceph: make free_choose_arg_map() resilient to partial allocation\n\nfree_choose_arg_map() may dereference a NULL pointer if its caller fails\nafter a partial allocation.\n\nFor example, in decode_choose_args(), if allocation of arg_map->args\nfails, execution jumps to the fail label and free_choose_arg_map() is\ncalled. Since arg_map->size is updated to a non-zero value before memory\nallocation, free_choose_arg_map() will iterate over arg_map->args and\ndereference a NULL pointer.\n\nTo prevent this potential NULL pointer dereference and make\nfree_choose_arg_map() more resilient, add checks for pointers

during\nuserfaultfd_release_all().  Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer\nto vma->vm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma->vm_flags.\n\nThe inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise()\nwith MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode,\nit accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of\nvma->vm_flags.\n\nAssuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and\nint are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the &=\n~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.\n\nVM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. \nAfter ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then\npromoted to unsigned long before the & operation.  This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n& operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a kernel BUG, but a WARNING at the same place:\n\n[   45.595973] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2474 at mm/userfaultfd.c:2067\n\nbut the root-cause (flag-drop) remains the same.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org:

Fix refcount leak when invalid session is found on session lookup","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: Fix refcount leak when invalid session is found on session lookup\n\nWhen a session is found but its state is not SMB2_SESSION_VALID, It\nindicates that no valid session was found, but it is missing to decrement\nthe reference count acquired

But there are cases where we could avoid revalidation.\n\nConsider:\n1  input -> j2 -> j3\n2  input -> j2 -> j3\n3  input -> j1 -> j2 -> j3\n\nThen the second rule does not need to revalidate j2, and, by extension j3,\nbecause this was already checked during validation of the first rule.\nWe need to validate it only for rule 3.\n\nThis is needed because chain loop detection also ensures we do not exceed\nthe jump stack: Just because we know that j2 is cycle free, its last jump\nmight now exceed the allowed stack size.  We also need to update all\nreachable chains with the new largest observed call depth.\n\nCare has to be taken to revalidate even if the chain depth won't be an\nissue: chain validation also ensures that expressions are not called from\ninvalid base chains.  For example, the masquerade expression can only be\ncalled from NAT postrouting base chains.\n\nTherefore we also need to keep record of the base chain context (type,\nhooknum) and revalidate if the chain becomes reachable from a different\nhook location.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a654de8fdc1815676ab750e70cab231fc814c29f"},{"fixed":"53de1e6cde8f9b791d9cf61aa0e7b02cf5bbe8b1"},{"fixed":"14fa3d1927f1382f86e3f70a51f26005c8e3cff6"},{"fixed":"09d6074995c186e449979fe6c1b0f1a69cf9bd3b"},{"fixed":"8e1a1bc4f5a42747c08130b8242ebebd1210b32f"}]}],"versions":["v4.17","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.63","v6.12.64","v6.12.65","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.18.3","v6.18.4","v6.18.5","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.100","v6.6.101","v6.6.102","v6.6.103","v6.6.104","v6.6.105","v6.6.106","v6.6.107","v6.6.108","v6.6.109","v6.6.11","v6.6.110","v6.6.111","v6.6.112","v6.6.113","v6.6.114","v6

This causes deadlock and system hangs later because mmap\nread or write lock cannot be taken.\n\nDowngrade mmap write lock to read lock if draining retry fault fix

disable recursive forward error correction","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm-verity: disable recursive forward error correction\n\nThere are two problems with the recursive correction:\n\n1. It may cause denial-of-service. In fec_read_bufs, there is a loop that\nhas 253 iterations. For each iteration, we may call verity_hash_for_block\nrecursively. There is a limit of 4 nested recursions - that means that\nthere may be at most 253^4 (4 billion) iterations. Red Hat QE team\nactually created an image that pushes dm-verity to this limit - and this\nimage just makes the udev-worker process get stuck in the 'D' state.\n\n2. It doesn't work.

nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec\n\nCommit efa56305908b (\"nvmet-tcp: Fix a kernel panic when host sends an invalid H2C PDU length\")\nadded ttag bounds checking and data_offset\nvalidation in nvmet_tcp_handle_h2c_data_pdu(), but it did not validate\nwhether the command's data structures (cmd->req.sg and cmd->iov) have\nbeen properly initialized before processing H2C_DATA PDUs.\n\nThe nvmet_tcp_build_pdu_iovec() function dereferences these pointers\nwithout NULL checks. This can be triggered by sending H2C_DATA PDU\nimmediately after the ICREQ/ICRESP handshake, before\nsending a CONNECT command or NVMe write command.\n\nAttack vectors that trigger NULL pointer dereferences:\n1. H2C_DATA PDU sent before CONNECT → both pointers NULL\n2. H2C_DATA PDU for READ command → cmd->req.sg allocated, cmd->iov NULL\n3.

tegra-adma: Fix use-after-free","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: tegra-adma: Fix use-after-free\n\nA use-after-free bug exists in the Tegra ADMA driver when audio streams\nare terminated, particularly during XRUN conditions. The issue occurs\nwhen the DMA buffer is freed by tegra_adma_terminate_all() before the\nvchan completion tasklet finishes accessing it.\n\nThe race condition follows this sequence:\n\n  1. DMA transfer completes, triggering an interrupt that schedules the\n     completion tasklet (tasklet has not executed yet)\n  2. Audio playback stops, calling tegra_adma_terminate_all() which\n     frees the DMA buffer memory via kfree()\n  3. The scheduled tasklet finally executes, calling vchan_complete()\n     which attempts to access the already-freed memory\n\nSince tasklets can execute at any time after being scheduled, there is\nno guarantee that the buffer will remain valid when vchan_complete()\nruns.\n\nFix this by properly synchronizing the virtual channel completion:\n - Calling vchan_terminate_vdesc() in tegra_adma_stop() to mark the\n   descriptors as terminated instead of freeing the descriptor.\n - Add the callback tegra_adma_synchronize() that calls\n   vchan_synchronize() which kills any pending tasklets and frees any\n   terminated descriptors.\n\nCrash logs:\n[  337.427523] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in vchan_complete+0x124/0x3b0\n[  337.427544] Read of size 8 at addr ffff000132055428 by task swapper/0/0\n\n[

protection on (struct macvlan_source_entry)->vlan.\n\nWhenever macvlan_hash_del_source() is called, we must clear\nentry->vlan pointer before RCU grace period starts.\n\nThis allows macvlan_forward_source() to skip over\nentries queued for freeing.\n\nNote that macvlan_dev are already RCU protected, as they\nare embedded in a standard netdev (netdev_priv(ndev)).\n\nhttps:

Per Intel's SDM,\nXSAVE saves XSTATE_BV as '0' for components that are disabled via XFD\n(and non-compacted XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the state\ncomponent):\n\n  If XSAVE, XSAVEC, XSAVEOPT, or XSAVES is saving the state component i,\n  the instruction does not generate #NM when XCR0[i] = IA32_XFD[i] = 1;\n  instead, it operates as if XINUSE[i] = 0 (and the state component was\n  in its initial state): it saves bit i of XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE\n  header as 0; in addition, XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the\n  state component (the other instructions do not save state component i).\n\nAlternatively, KVM could always do XRSTOR with XFD=0, e.g. by using\na constant XFD based on the set of enabled features when XSAVEing for\na struct fpu_guest.  However, having XSTATE_BV[i]=1 for XFD-disabled\nfeatures can only happen in the above interrupt case, or in similar\nscenarios involving preemption on preemptible kernels, because\nfpu_swap_kvm_fpstate()'s call to save_fpregs_to_fpstate() saves the\noutgoing FPU state with the current XFD; and that is (on all but the\nfirst WRMSR to XFD) the guest XFD.\n\nTherefore, XFD

rt_del_uncached_list()\n\nsyzbot was able to crash the kernel in rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev()\nin an interesting way [1]\n\nCrash happens in list_del_init()/INIT_LIST_HEAD() while writing\nlist->prev, while the prior write on list->next went well.\n\nstatic inline void INIT_LIST_HEAD(struct list_head *list)\n{\n\tWRITE_ONCE(list->next, list); // This went well\n\tWRITE_ONCE(list->prev, list); // Crash, @list has been freed.\n}\n\nIssue here is that rt6_uncached_list_del() did not attempt to lock\nul->lock, as list_empty(&rt->dst.rt_uncached) returned\ntrue because the WRITE_ONCE(list->next, list) happened on the other CPU.\n\nWe might use list_del_init_careful() and list_empty_careful(),\nor make sure rt6_uncached_list_del() always grabs the spinlock\nwhenever rt->dst.rt_uncached_list has been set.\n\nA similar fix is neeed for IPv4.\n\n[1]\n\n BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in INIT_LIST_HEAD include/linux/list.h:46 [inline]\n BUG:

Fix crash on profile change rollback failure","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: Fix crash on profile change rollback failure\n\nmlx5e_netdev_change_profile can fail to attach a new profile and can\nfail to rollback to old profile, in such case, we could end up with a\ndangling netdev with a fully reset netdev_priv. A retry to change\nprofile, e.g. another attempt to call mlx5e_netdev_change_profile via\nswitchdev mode change, will crash trying to access the now NULL\npriv->mdev.\n\nThis fix allows mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() to handle previous\nfailures and an empty priv, by not assuming priv is valid.\n\nPass netdev and mdev to all flows requiring\nmlx5e_netdev_change_profile() and avoid passing priv.\nIn mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() check if current priv is valid, and if\nnot, just attach the new profile without trying to access the old one.\n\nThis fixes the following oops, when enabling switchdev mode for the 2nd\ntime after first time failure:\n\n ## Enabling switchdev mode first time:\n\nmlx5_core 0012:03:00.1: E-Switch: Supported tc chains and prios offload\nworkqueue:

This simplifies the\nfaultable code path by using the standard kernel file reading interface\nwhich handles all the complexity of reading file data.\n\nAt the moment we are not changing the code for non-sleepable context which\nuses filemap_get_folio() and only succeeds if the target folios are\nalready in memory and up-to-date.  The reason is to keep the patch simple\nand easier to backport to stable kernels.\n\nSyzbot repro does not crash the kernel anymore and the selftests run\nsuccessfully.\n\nIn the follow up we will make __kernel_read() with IOCB_NOWAIT work for\nnon-sleepable contexts.  In addition, I would like to replace the\nsecretmem check with a more generic approach and will add fstest for the\nbuildid code.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ad41251c290dfe3c01472c94d2439a59de23fe97"},{"fixed":"b11dfb7708f212b96c7973a474014c071aa02e05"},{"fixed":"568aeb3476c770a3863c755dd2a199c212434286"},{"fixed":"777a8560fd29738350c5094d4166fe5499452409"}]}],"versions":["v6.11","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.63","v6.12.64","v6.12.65","v6.12.66","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.18.3","v6.18.4","v6.18.5","v6.18.6","v6.19-rc1","v6.19-rc2","v6.19-rc3","v6.19-rc4","v6.19-rc5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23002.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.12.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.67"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23002.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/568aeb3476c770a3863c755dd2a199c212434286"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/777a8560fd29738350c5094d4166fe5499452409"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b11dfb7708f212b96c7973a474014c071aa02e05"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23002.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23002"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23002.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:04.477331Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23013","published":"2026-01-25T14:36:26.208Z","modified":"2026-01-25T19:56:35.321115Z","summary":"net: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: octeon_ep_vf: fix free_irq dev_id mismatch in IRQ rollback\n\noctep_vf_request_irqs() requests MSI-X queue IRQs with dev_id set to\nioq_vector.

remove call_control in inactive contexts","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/core: remove call_control in inactive contexts\n\nIf damon_call() is executed against a DAMON context that is not running,\nthe function returns error while keeping the damon_call_control object\nlinked to the context's call_controls list.  Let's suppose the object is\ndeallocated after the damon_call(), and yet another damon_call() is\nexecuted against the same context.  The function tries to add the new\ndamon_call_control object to the call_controls list, which still has the\npointer to the previous damon_call_control object, which is deallocated. \nAs a result, use-after-free happens.\n\nThis can actually be triggered using the DAMON sysfs interface.  It is not\neasily exploitable since it requires the sysfs write permission and making\na definitely weird file writes, though.  Please refer to the report for\nmore details about the issue reproduction steps.\n\nFix the issue by making two changes.  Firstly, move the final\nkdamond_call() for cancelling all existing damon_call() requests from\nterminating DAMON context to be done before the ctx->kdamond reset.  This\nmakes any code that sees NULL ctx->kdamond can safely assume the context\nmay not access damon_call() requests anymore.  Secondly, let damon_call()\nto cleanup the damon_call_control objects that were added to the\nalready-terminated DAMON context, before returning the error.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"004ded6bee11b8ed463cdc54b89a4390f4b64f6d"},{"fixed":"23b061f421eef03647b512f3df48861706c87db3"},{"fixed":"f9132fbc2e83baf2c45a77043672a63a675c9394"}]}],"versions":["v6.16","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.18.3","v6.18.4","v6.18.5","v6.18.6","v6.19-rc1","v6.19-rc2","v6.19-rc3","v6.19-rc4","v6.19-rc5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23012.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-23012.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23b061f421eef03647b512f3df48861706c87db3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f9132fbc2e83baf2c45a77043672a63a675c9394"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23012.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23012"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/23xxx/CVE-2026-23012.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:04.478483Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2026-23008","published":"2026-01-25T14:36:21.933Z","modified":"2026-01-25T19:52:26.851860Z","summary":"drm/vmwgfx: Fix KMS with 3D on HW version 10","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/vmwgfx: Fix KMS with 3D on HW version 10\n\nHW version 10 does not have GB Surfaces so there is no backing buffer for\nsurface backed FBs.

mscc: ocelot: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mscc: ocelot: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag\n\nCommit 15faa1f67ab4 (\"lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag\")\nfixed a similar issue in the lan966x driver caused by a NULL pointer dereference.\nThe ocelot_set_aggr_pgids() function in the ocelot driver has similar logic\nand is susceptible to the same crash.\n\nThis issue specifically affects the ocelot_vsc7514.c frontend, which leaves\nunused ports as NULL pointers. The felix_vsc9959.c frontend is unaffected as\nit uses the DSA framework which registers all ports.\n\nFix this by checking if the port pointer is valid before accessing it.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"528d3f190c98c8f7d9581f68db4af021696727b2"},{"fixed":"8767f238b0e6c3d0b295ac6dce9fbe6a99bd1b9d"},{"fixed":"b17818307446c5a8d925a39a792261dbfa930041"},{"fixed":"2985712dc76dfa670eb7fd607c09d4d48e5f5c6e"},{"fixed":"03fb1708b7d1e76aecebf767ad059c319845039f"},{"fixed":"f490af47bbee02441e356a1e0b86e3b3dd5120ff"},{"fixed":"34f3ff52cb9fa7dbf04f5c734fcc4cb6ed5d1a95"}]}],"versions":["v5.11","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.127","v5.15.128","v5.15.129","v5.15.13","v5.15.130","v5.15.131","v5.15.132","v5.15.133","v5.15.134","v5.15.135","v5.15.136","v5.15.137","v5.15.138","v5.15.139","v5.15.14","v5.15.140","v5.15.141","v5.15.142","v5.15.143","v5.15.144","v5.15.145","v5.15.146","v5.15.147","v5.15.148","v5.15.149","v5.15.15","v5.15.150","v5.15.151","v5.15.152","v5.15.153","v5.15.154","v5.15.155","v5.15.156","v5.15.157","v5.15.158","v5.15.159","v5.15.16","v5.15.160","v5.15.161","v5.15.162","v5.15.163","v5.15.164","v5.15.165","v5.15.166","v5.15.167","v5.15.168","v5.15.169","v5.15.17","v5.15.170","v5.15.171","v5.15.172","v5.15.173","v5.15.174","v5.15.175","v5.15.176","v5.15.177","v5.15.178","v5.15.179","v5.15.18","v5.15.180","v5.15.181","v5.15.182","v5.15.183","v5.15.184","v5.15.185","v5.15.186","v5.15.187","v5.15.188","v5.15.189","v5.15.19","v5.15.190","v5.15.191","v5.15.192","v5.15.193","v5.15.194","v5.15.195","v5.15.196","v5.15.197","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.160","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6"

If submission\n  fails, the callback never runs and the memory is leaked.\n\n  Fix this by freeing both the URB and the request structure in the error\n  path when usb_submit_urb()

provide locking for v4_end_grace","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: provide locking for v4_end_grace\n\nWriting to v4_end_grace can race with server shutdown and result in\nmemory being accessed after it was freed - reclaim_str_hashtbl in\nparticularly.\n\nWe cannot hold nfsd_mutex across the nfsd4_end_grace() call as that is\nheld while client_tracking_op->init() is called and that can wait for\nan upcall to nfsdcltrack which can write to v4_end_grace, resulting in a\ndeadlock.\n\nnfsd4_end_grace() is also called by the landromat work queue and this\ndoesn't require locking as server shutdown will stop the work and wait\nfor it before freeing anything that nfsd4_end_grace() might access.\n\nHowever, we must be sure that writing to v4_end_grace doesn't restart\nthe work item after shutdown has already waited for it.  For this we\nadd a new flag protected with nn->client_lock.  It is set only while it\nis safe to make client tracking calls, and v4_end_grace only schedules\nwork while the flag is set with the spinlock held.\n\nSo this patch adds a nfsd_net field \"client_tracking_active\" which is\nset as described.  Another field \"grace_end_forced\", is set when\nv4_end_grace is written.

A debug printk() patch found that a refcount is obtained at\nxdp_convert_md_to_buff() from bpf_prog_test_run_xdp().\n\nAccording to commit ec94670fcb3b (\"bpf: Support specifying ingress via\nxdp_md

Reject narrower access to pointer ctx fields","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Reject narrower access to pointer ctx fields\n\nThe following BPF program, simplified from a syzkaller repro, causes a\nkernel warning:\n\n    r0 = *(u8 *)(r1 + 169);\n    exit;\n\nWith pointer field sk being at offset 168 in __sk_buff. This access is\ndetected as a narrower read in bpf_skb_is_valid_access because it\ndoesn't match offsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk). It is therefore allowed\nand later proceeds to bpf_convert_ctx_access. Note that for the\n\"is_narrower_load\" case in the convert_ctx_accesses(), the insn->off\nis aligned, so the cnt may not be 0 because it matches the\noffsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk) in the bpf_convert_ctx_access. However,\nthe target_size stays 0 and the verifier errors with a kernel warning:\n\n    verifier bug: error during ctx access conversion(1)\n\nThis patch fixes that to return a proper \"invalid bpf_context access\noff=X size=Y\" error on the load instruction.\n\nThe same issue affects multiple other fields in context structures that\nallow narrow access.

In all other cases, don't touch\nthe LUT.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n** Bring the interface down (if up)\nifconfig eth1 down\n\n** update the queue count (eg., 27->20)\nethtool -L eth1 combined 20\n\n** display the RSS LUT\nethtool -x eth1\n\n[82375.558338] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n[82375.558373] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[82375.558391] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n[82375.558408] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[82375.558421] Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n<snip>\n[82375.558516] RIP: 0010:idpf_get_rxfh+0x108/0x150 [idpf]\n[82375.558786] Call Trace:\n[82375.558793]  <TASK>\n[82375.558804]  rss_prepare.isra.0+0x187/0x2a0\n[82375.558827]  rss_prepare_data+0x3a/0x50\n[82375.558845]  ethnl_default_doit+0x13d/0x3e0\n[82375.558863]  genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x11f/0x180\n[82375.558886]  genl_rcv_msg+0x1ad/0x2b0\n[82375.558902]  ? __pfx_ethnl_default_doit+0x10/0x10\n[82375.558920]  ? __pfx_genl_rcv_msg+0x10/0x10\n[82375.558937]  netlink_rcv_skb+0x58/0x100\n[82375.558957]  genl_rcv+0x2c/0x50\n[82375.558971]  netlink_unicast+0x289/0x3e0\n[82375.558988]  netlink_sendmsg+0x215/0x440\n[82375.559005]  __sys_sendto+0x234/0x240\n[82375.559555]  __x64_sys_sendto+0x28/0x30\n[82375.560068]  x64_sys_call+0x1909/0x1da0\n[82375.560576]  do_syscall_64+0x7a/0xfa0\n[82375.561076]  ? clear_bhb_loop+0x60/0xb0\n[82375.561567]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n<snip>","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"02cbfba1add5bd9088c7d14c6b93b77a6ea8f3bb"},{"fixed":"ab92fa4dd81beaaed4e93a851f7a37c9b2d9776f"},{"fixed":"ebecca5b093895da801b3eba1a55b4ec4027d196"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.18.3","v6.18.4","v6.18.5","v6.19-rc1","v6.19-rc2","v6.19-rc3","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22993.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2026-22993.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ab92fa4dd81beaaed4e93a851f7a37c9b2d9776f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebecca5b093895da801b3eba1a55b4ec4027d196"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22993.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22993"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2026/22xxx/CVE-2026-22993.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:04.476333Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-71151","published":"2026-01-23T14:15:17.916Z","modified":"2026-01-23T19:59:54.843538Z","summary":"cifs: Fix memory and information leak in smb3_reconfigure()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncifs: Fix memory and information leak in smb3_reconfigure()\n\nIn smb3_reconfigure(), if smb3_sync_session_ctx_passwords() fails, the\nfunction returns immediately without freeing and erasing the newly\nallocated new_password and new_password2.

fix.\n\nmsg_get_inq is an input field from caller to callee. Don't set it in\nthe callee, as the caller may not clear it on struct reuse.\n\nThis is a kernel-internal variant of msghdr only, and the only user\ndoes reinitialize the field. So this is not critical for that reason.\nBut it is more robust to avoid the write, and slightly simpler code.\nAnd it fixes a bug, see below.\n\nCallers set msg_get_inq to request the input queue length to be\nreturned in msg_inq. This is equivalent to but independent from the\nSO_INQ request to return that same info as a cmsg (tp->recvmsg_inq).\nTo reduce branching in the hot path the second also sets the msg_inq.\nThat is WAI.\n\nThis is a fix to commit 4d1442979e4a (\"af_unix: don't post cmsg for\nSO_INQ unless explicitly asked for\"), which fixed the inverse.\n\nAlso avoid NULL pointer dereference in unix_stream_read_generic if\nstate->msg is NULL and msg->msg_get_inq is written.

Fix RSS LUT NULL pointer crash on early ethtool operations","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nidpf: Fix RSS LUT NULL pointer crash on early ethtool operations\n\nThe RSS LUT is not initialized until the interface comes up, causing\nthe following NULL pointer crash when ethtool operations like rxhash on/off\nare performed before the interface is brought up for the first time.\n\nMove RSS LUT initialization from ndo_open to vport creation to ensure LUT\nis always available. This enables RSS configuration via ethtool before\nbringing the interface up. Simplify LUT management by maintaining all\nchanges in the driver's soft copy and programming zeros to the indirection\ntable when rxhash is disabled.

The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in

The OF path, which uses of_find_net_device_by_node(), never releases\n   the elevated refcount on the conduit's kobject. Nominally, the OF and\n   non-OF paths should result in objects having identical reference\n   counts taken, and it is already suspicious that\n   dsa_dev_to_net_device() has a put_device() call which is missing in\n   dsa_port_parse_of(), but we can actually even verify that an issue\n   exists. With CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE=y, if we run this command\n   \"before\" and \"after\" applying this patch:\n\n(unbind the conduit driver for net device eno2)\necho 0000:00:00.2 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/fsl_enetc/unbind\n\nwe see these lines in the output diff which appear only with the patch\napplied:\n\nkobject: 'eno2' (ffff002009a3a6b8): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)\nkobject: '109' (ffff0020099d59a0): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)\n\n2. After we find the conduit interface one way (OF) or another (non-OF),\n   it can get unregistered at any time, and DSA remains with a long-lived,\n   but in this case stale, cpu_dp->conduit pointer. Holding the net\n   device's underlying kobject isn't actually of much help, it just\n   prevents it from being freed (but we never need that kobject\n   directly). What helps us to prevent the net device from being\n   unregistered is the parallel netdev reference mechanism (dev_hold()\n   and dev_put()).\n\nActually we actually use that netdev tracker mechanism implicitly on\nuser ports since commit 2f1e8ea726e9 (\"net: dsa: link interfaces with\nthe DSA master to get rid of lockdep warnings\"), via netdev_upper_dev_link().\nBut time still passes at DSA switch probe time between the initial\nof_find_net_device_by_node() code and the user port creation time, time\nduring which the conduit could unregister itself and DSA wouldn't know\nabout it.\n\nSo we have to run of_find_net_device_by_node() under rtnl_lock() to\nprevent that from happening, and release the lock only with the netdev\ntracker having acquired the reference.\n\nDo we need to keep the reference until dsa_unregister_switch() /\ndsa_switch_shutdown()?\n1: Maybe yes. A switch device will still be registered even if all user\n   ports failed to probe, see commit 86f8b1c01a0a (\"net: dsa: Do not\n   make user port errors fatal\"), and the cpu_dp->conduit pointers\n   remain valid.  I haven't audited all call paths to see whether they\n   will actually use the conduit in lack of any user port, but if they\n   do, it seems safer to not rely on user ports for that reference.\n2. Definitely yes. We support changing the conduit which a user port is\n   associated to, and we can get into a situation where we've moved all\n   user ports away from a conduit, thus no longer hold any reference to\n   it via the net device tracker. But we shouldn't let it go nonetheless\n   - see the next change in relation to dsa_tree_find_first_conduit()\n   and LAG conduits which disappear.\n   We have to be prepared to return to the physical conduit, so the CPU\n   port must explicitly keep another reference to it. This is also to\n   say: the user ports and their CPU ports may not always keep a\n   reference to the same conduit net device, and both are needed.\n\nAs for the conduit's kobject for the /sys/class/net/ entry, we don't\ncare about it, we can release it as soon as we hold the net device\nobject itself.\n\nHistory and blame attribution\n-----------------------------\n\nThe code has been refactored so many times, it is very difficult to\nfollow and properly attribute a blame, but I'll try to make a short\nhistory which I hope to be correct.\n\nWe have two distinct probing paths:\n- one for OF, introduced in 2016

fix memory leak in skb_segment_list for GRO packets","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix memory leak in skb_segment_list for GRO packets\n\nWhen skb_segment_list() is called during packet forwarding, it handles\npackets that were aggregated by the GRO engine.\n\nHistorically, the segmentation logic in skb_segment_list assumes that\nindividual segments are split from a parent SKB and may need to carry\ntheir own socket memory accounting. Accordingly, the code transfers\ntruesize from the parent to the newly created segments.\n\nPrior to commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\"), this\ntruesize subtraction in skb_segment_list() was valid because fragments\nstill carry a reference to the original socket.\n\nHowever, commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\") changed\nthis behavior by ensuring that fraglist entries are explicitly\norphaned (skb->sk = NULL) to prevent illegal orphaning later in the\nstack. This change meant that the entire socket memory charge remained\nwith the head SKB, but the corresponding accounting logic in\nskb_segment_list() was never updated.\n\nAs a result, the current code unconditionally adds each fragment's\ntruesize to delta_truesize and subtracts it from the parent SKB. Since\nthe fragments are no longer charged to the socket, this subtraction\nresults in an effective under-count of memory when the head is freed.\nThis causes sk_wmem_alloc to remain non-zero, preventing socket\ndestruction and leading to a persistent memory leak.\n\nThe leak can be observed via KMEMLEAK when tearing down the networking\nenvironment:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881e6eb9100 (size 2048):\n  comm \"ping\", pid 6720, jiffies 4295492526\n  backtrace:\n    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof+0x5c6/0x800\n    sk_prot_alloc+0x5b/0x220\n    sk_alloc+0x35/0xa00\n    inet6_create.part.0+0x303/0x10d0\n    __sock_create+0x248/0x640\n    __sys_socket+0x11b/0x1d0\n\nSince skb_segment_list() is exclusively used for SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST\npackets constructed by GRO, the truesize adjustment is removed.\n\nThe call to skb_release_head_state() must be preserved. As documented in\ncommit cf673ed0e057 (\"net: fix fraglist segmentation reference count\nleak\"), it is still required to correctly drop references to SKB\nextensions that may be overwritten during

sch_qfq: Fix NULL deref when deactivating inactive aggregate in qfq_reset","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_qfq: Fix NULL deref when deactivating inactive aggregate in qfq_reset\n\n`qfq_class->leaf_qdisc->q.qlen > 0` does not imply that the class\nitself is active.\n\nTwo qfq_class objects may point to the same leaf_qdisc. This happens\nwhen:\n\n1. one QFQ qdisc is attached to the dev as the root qdisc, and\n\n2. another QFQ qdisc is temporarily referenced (e.g., via qdisc_get()\n/ qdisc_put()) and is pending to be destroyed, as in function\ntc_new_tfilter.\n\nWhen packets are enqueued through the root QFQ qdisc, the shared\nleaf_qdisc->q.qlen increases. At the same time, the second QFQ\nqdisc triggers qdisc_put and qdisc_destroy: the qdisc enters\nqfq_reset() with its own q->q.qlen == 0, but its class's leaf\nqdisc->q.qlen > 0. Therefore, the qfq_reset would wrongly deactivate\nan inactive aggregate and trigger a null-deref in qfq_deactivate_agg:\n\n[    0.903172] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:

sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue\n\nskbuff_fclone_cache was created without defining a usercopy region,\n[1] unlike skbuff_head_cache which properly whitelists the cb[] field.\n[2] This causes a usercopy BUG() when CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is\nenabled and the kernel attempts to copy sk_buff.cb data to userspace\nvia sock_recv_errqueue() -> put_cmsg().\n\nThe crash occurs when: 1. TCP allocates an skb using alloc_skb_fclone()\n   (from skbuff_fclone_cache) [1]\n2. The skb is cloned via skb_clone() using the pre-allocated fclone\n[3] 3. The cloned skb is queued to sk_error_queue for timestamp\nreporting 4. Userspace reads the error queue via recvmsg(MSG_ERRQUEUE)\n5. sock_recv_errqueue() calls put_cmsg() to copy serr->ee from skb->cb\n[4] 6. __check_heap_object() fails because skbuff_fclone_cache has no\n   usercopy whitelist [5]\n\nWhen cloned skbs allocated from skbuff_fclone_cache are used in the\nsocket error queue, accessing the sock_exterr_skb structure in skb->cb\nvia put_cmsg() triggers a usercopy hardening violation:\n\n[    5.379589] usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object 'skbuff_fclone_cache' (offset 296, size 16)!\n[    5.382796] kernel BUG at

function extracts a length field from the packet\nheader and, when FCS is disabled, subtracts 2 from this length without\nvalidating that len >= 2.\n\nIf an attacker sends a malicious packet with a length field of 0 or 1\nto an interface with FCS disabled, the subtraction causes an integer\nunderflow.\n\nThis can lead to memory exhaustion and kernel instability, potential\ninformation disclosure

Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nima: Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()\n\nIn ima_match_rules(), if ima_filter_rule_match() returns -ENOENT due to\nthe rule being NULL, the function incorrectly skips the 'if (!rc)' check\nand sets 'result = true'. The LSM rule is considered a match, causing\nextra files to be measured by IMA.\n\nThis issue can be reproduced in the following scenario:\nAfter unloading the SELinux policy module via 'semodule -d', if an IMA\nmeasurement is triggered before ima_lsm_rules is updated,\nin ima_match_rules(), the first call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns\n-ESTALE. This causes the code to enter the 'if (rc == -ESTALE &&\n!rule_reinitialized)' block, perform ima_lsm_copy_rule() and retry. In\nima_lsm_copy_rule(), since the SELinux module has been removed, the rule\nbecomes NULL, and the second call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns\n-ENOENT. This bypasses the 'if (!rc)' check and results in a false match.\n\nCall trace:\n  selinux_audit_rule_match+0x310/0x3b8\n  security_audit_rule_match+0x60/0xa0\n  ima_match_rules+0x2e4/0x4a0\n

When an allocation fails, the previously\nsuccessful allocations are not freed on exit.\n\nFix that by jumping to err_free_rings label on error, which calls\nrtl8180_free_rx_ring() to free the allocations. Remove the free of\nrx_ring in rtl8180_init_rx_ring() error path, and set the freed\npriv->rx_buf entry to null, to avoid double

bit mode\n\nCommit fc96ec826bce (\"spi: fsl-cpm: Use 16 bit mode for large transfers\nwith even size\") failed to make sure that the size is really even\nbefore switching to 16 bit mode. Until recently the problem went\nunnoticed because kernfs uses a pre-allocated bounce buffer of size\nPAGE_SIZE for reading EEPROM.\n\nBut commit 8ad6249c51d0 (\"eeprom: at25: convert to spi-mem

Verify inode mode when loading from disk","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: Verify inode mode when loading from disk\n\nsyzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when\nthe S_IFMT bits of the 16bits \"mode\" field loaded from disk are corrupted.\n\nAccording to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS\n8 and 9. According to [2], the reserved field was explicitly initialized\nwith 0, and that field must remain 0 as long as reserved. Therefore, when\nthe \"mode\" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file must be\nS_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/\nS_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK if dir ==

fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain\n\nsyzbot reported a kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() because the\n`cl_next_free_rec` field of the allocation chain list (next free slot in\nthe chain list) is 0, triggring the BUG_ON(!cl->cl_next_free_rec)\ncondition in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() and panicking the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, an if condition is introduced in ocfs2_claim_suballoc_bits(),\njust before calling ocfs2_find_victim_chain(), the code block in it being\nexecuted when either of the following conditions is true:\n\n1. `cl_next_free_rec` is equal to 0, indicating that there are no free\nchains in the allocation chain list\n2. `cl_next_free_rec` is greater than `cl_count` (the total number of\nchains in the allocation chain list)\n\nEither of them being true is indicative of the fact that there are no\nchains left for usage.\n\nThis is addressed using ocfs2_error(), which prints\nthe error log for debugging purposes, rather than panicking the

Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query\n\nThe ethtool -S command operates across three ioctl calls:\nETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO for the size, ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS for the names, and\nETHTOOL_GSTATS for the values.\n\nIf the number of stats changes between these calls (e.g., due to device\nreconfiguration), userspace's buffer allocation will be incorrect,\npotentially leading to buffer overflow.\n\nDrivers are generally expected to maintain stable stat counts, but some\ndrivers (e.g., mlx5, bnx2x, bna, ksz884x) use dynamic counters, making\nthis scenario possible.\n\nSome drivers try to handle this internally:\n- bnad_get_ethtool_stats() returns early in case stats.n_stats is not\n  equal to the driver's stats count.\n- micrel/ksz884x also makes sure not to write anything beyond\n  stats.n_stats and overflow the buffer.\n\nHowever, both use stats.n_stats which is already assigned with the value\nreturned from get_sset_count(), hence won't solve the issue described\nhere.\n\nChange ethtool_get_strings(), ethtool_get_stats(),\nethtool_get_phy_stats() to not return anything in case of a mismatch\nbetween userspace's size and get_sset_size(), to prevent buffer\noverflow.\nThe returned n_stats value will be equal to zero, to reflect that\nnothing has been returned.\n\nThis could result in one of two cases when using upstream ethtool,\ndepending on when the size change is detected:\n1. When detected in ethtool_get_strings():\n    # ethtool -S eth2\n    no stats available\n\n2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.\n\nBoth cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call\nshould succeed.\n\nOther than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no\noutput/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting\nincorrect/shifted stats.\nI also considered returning an error instead of a \"silent\" response, but\nthat seems more destructive towards userspace apps.\n\nNotes:\n- This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure\n  that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more\n  predictable behavior.\n\n- RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between\n  the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.\n\n- Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that\n  these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications\n  which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,\n  to prevent any

multiq3: sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: multiq3: sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()\n\nSyzbot identified an issue [1] in multiq3_attach() that induces a\ntask timeout due to open() or COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl operations,\nspecifically, in the case of multiq3 driver.\n\nThis problem arose when syzkaller managed to craft weird configuration\noptions used to specify the number of channels in encoder subdevice.\nIf a particularly great number is passed to s->n_chan in\nmultiq3_attach() via it->options[2], then multiple calls to\nmultiq3_encoder_reset() at the end of driver-specific attach() method\nwill be running for minutes, thus blocking tasks and affected devices\nas well.\n\nWhile this issue is most likely not too dangerous for real-life\ndevices, it still makes sense to sanitize configuration inputs. Enable\na sensible limit on the number of encoder chips (4 chips max, each\nwith 2 channels) to stop this behaviour from manifesting.\n\n[1] Syzbot crash:\nINFO: task syz.2.19:6067 blocked for more than 143 seconds.\n...\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:5254 [inline]\n __schedule+0x17c4/0x4d60 kernel/sched/core.c:6862\n __schedule_loop kernel/sched/core.c:6944

delete x->tunnel as we delete x","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x\n\nThe ipcomp fallback tunnels currently get deleted (from the various\nlists and hashtables) as the last user state that needed that fallback\nis destroyed (not deleted). If a reference to that user state still\nexists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,\ntriggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining\nreferences, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 (\"xfrm: destroy xfrm_state\nsynchronously on net exit path\") is not complete.\n\nWe recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of\nskbs (commit 9b6412e6979f (\"tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we\ncurrently drop dst\")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs\nwith a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns\ndestruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the\ntime xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)\nxfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding\nfallback state.\n\nInstead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,\nthis patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the\nfallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been\ndeleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is\ndropped.\n\nA separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since\nwe're going to lock x->tunnel while x is

vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership\n\nvidtv_channel_si_init() creates a temporary list (program, service, event)\nand ownership of the memory itself is transferred to the PAT/SDT/EIT\ntables through vidtv_psi_pat_program_assign(),\nvidtv_psi_sdt_service_assign(), vidtv_psi_eit_event_assign().\n\nThe problem here is that the local pointer where the memory ownership\ntransfer was completed is not initialized to NULL. This causes the\nvidtv_psi_pmt_create_sec_for_each_pat_entry() function to fail, and\nin the flow that jumps to free_eit, the memory that was freed by\nvidtv_psi_*_table_destroy() can be accessed

fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create\n\nWhen sync() and link() are called concurrently, both threads may\nenter hfs_bnode_find() without finding the node in the hash table\nand proceed to create it.\n\nThread A:\n  hfsplus_write_inode()\n    -> hfsplus_write_system_inode()\n      -> hfs_btree_write()\n        -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)\n          -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)\n\nThread B:\n  hfsplus_create_cat()\n    -> hfs_brec_insert()\n      -> hfs_bnode_split()\n        -> hfs_bmap_alloc()\n          -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)\n            -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)\n\nIn this case, thread A creates the bnode, sets refcnt=1, and hashes it.\nThread B also tries to create the same bnode, notices it has already\nbeen inserted, drops its own instance, and uses the hashed one without\ngetting the node.\n\n```\n\n\tnode2 = hfs_bnode_findhash(tree, cnid);\n\tif (!node2) {                                 <- Thread A\n\t\thash = hfs_bnode_hash(cnid);\n\t\tnode->next_hash = tree->node_hash[hash];\n\t\ttree->node_hash[hash] = node;\n\t\ttree->node_hash_cnt++;\n\t} else {                                      <- Thread B\n\t\tspin_unlock(&tree->hash_lock);\n\t\tkfree(node);\n\t\twait_event(node2->lock_wq,\n\t\t\t!test_bit(HFS_BNODE_NEW, &node2->flags));\n\t\treturn node2;\n\t}\n```\n\nHowever, hfs_bnode_find() requires each call to take a reference.\nHere both threads end up setting refcnt=1. When they later put the node,\nthis triggers:\n\nBUG_ON(!atomic_read(&node->refcnt))\n\nIn this scenario, Thread B in fact finds the node in the hash table\nrather than creating a new one, and thus must take a reference.\n\nFix this by calling hfs_bnode_get() when reusing a bnode newly created by\nanother thread to ensure the refcount is updated correctly.\n\nA similar bug was fixed in HFS long ago in commit\na9dc087fd3c4 (\"fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create\")\nbut the same issue remained in HFS+ until

(w83791d) Convert macros to functions to avoid TOCTOU","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (w83791d) Convert macros to functions to avoid TOCTOU\n\nThe macro FAN_FROM_REG evaluates its arguments multiple times. When used\nin lockless contexts involving shared driver data, this leads to\nTime-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions, potentially\ncausing divide-by-zero errors.\n\nConvert the macro to a static function. This guarantees that arguments\nare evaluated only once (pass-by-value), preventing the race\nconditions.\n\nAdditionally, in store_fan_div, move the calculation of the minimum\nlimit inside the update lock.

packet\n(skb->len from urb->actual_length) is large enough to contain this\nheader.\n\nIf a truncated packet is received, this will lead to a buffer\nunderflow, reading memory before the start of the skb data area,\nand causing a kernel panic.\n\nAdd length checks for both rtl8187 and rtl8187b descriptor headers\nbefore attempting to access them, dropping the packet cleanly if the\ncheck

Avoid walking the Namespace if start_node is NULL","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPICA: Avoid walking the Namespace if start_node is NULL\n\nAlthough commit 0c9992315e73 (\"ACPICA: Avoid walking the ACPI Namespace\nif it is not there\") fixed the situation when both start_node and\nacpi_gbl_root_node are NULL, the Linux kernel mainline now still crashed\non Honor Magicbook 14 Pro [1].\n\nThat happens due to the access to the member of parent_node in\nacpi_ns_get_next_node().  The NULL pointer dereference will always\nhappen, no matter whether or not the start_node is equal to\nACPI_ROOT_OBJECT, so move the check of start_node being NULL\nout of the if

c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration\n\nThe Comedi low-level driver \"c6xdigio\" seems to be for a parallel port\nconnected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi\n\"attach\" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this\ndriver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by\nregistering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the\nreturn value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and\n`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi \"detach\" handler\n`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with\n`pnp_unregister_driver()`.\n\nIt is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it\ncalls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to\n`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both\ncases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it\ndoes in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be\ncalled by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if\nthe Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for\nsome other reason.)\n\nThe unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous\nsuccessful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause\n`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning \"Unexpected driver\nunregister!\".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].\n\nAlso, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at\nmodule init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching\nComedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi\ndevice being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)\n\nChange the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,\nand the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`\nnow only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change\nthe Comedi driver \"detach\" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n[1] Syzbot sample crash report:\nUnexpected driver unregister!\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5970 at drivers/base/driver.c:273

do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfsnotify: do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files\n\ninotify/fanotify do not allow users with no read access to a file to\nsubscribe to events (e.g. IN_ACCESS/IN_MODIFY), but they do allow the\nsame user to subscribe for watching events on children when the user\nhas access to the parent directory (e.g. /dev).\n\nUsers with no read access to a file but with read access to its parent\ndirectory can still stat the file and see if it was accessed/modified\nvia atime/mtime change.\n\nThe same is not true for special files (e.g. /dev/null). Users will not\ngenerally observe atime/mtime changes when other users read/write to\nspecial files, only when someone sets atime/mtime via utimensat().\n\nAlign fsnotify events with this stat behavior and do not generate\nACCESS/MODIFY events to parent watchers on read/write of special files.\nThe events are still generated to parent watchers on utimensat(). This\ncloses some side-channels that could be possibly used for information\nexfiltration [1].\n\n[1]
