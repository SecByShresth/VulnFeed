with pending tasklets\nbefore freeing the asd_ha structure, leading to a potential\nuse-after-free vulnerability.\n\nWhen a device removal is triggered (via hot-unplug or module unload),\nrace condition can occur.\n\nThe fix adds tasklet_kill() before freeing the asd_ha structure,\nensuring all scheduled tasklets complete before cleanup

BUG() in pskb_expand_head() as part of calipso_skbuff_setattr()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: BUG() in pskb_expand_head() as part of calipso_skbuff_setattr()\n\nThere exists a kernel oops caused by a BUG_ON(nhead < 0) at\nnet/core/skbuff.c:2232 in pskb_expand_head().\nThis bug is triggered as part of the calipso_skbuff_setattr()\nroutine when skb_cow() is passed headroom > INT_MAX\n(i.e. (int)(skb_headroom(skb) + len_delta) < 0).\n\nThe root cause of the bug is due to an implicit integer cast in\n__skb_cow(). The check (headroom > skb_headroom(skb)) is meant to ensure\nthat delta = headroom - skb_headroom(skb) is never negative, otherwise\nwe will trigger a BUG_ON in pskb_expand_head().

nfc: fix deadlock between nfc_unregister_device and rfkill_fop_write","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: nfc: fix deadlock between nfc_unregister_device and rfkill_fop_write\n\nA deadlock can occur between nfc_unregister_device() and rfkill_fop_write()\ndue to lock ordering inversion between device_lock and rfkill_global_mutex.\n\nThe problematic lock order is:\n\nThread A (rfkill_fop_write):\n  rfkill_fop_write()\n    mutex_lock(&rfkill_global_mutex)\n      rfkill_set_block()\n        nfc_rfkill_set_block()\n          nfc_dev_down()\n            device_lock(&dev->dev)    <- waits for device_lock\n\nThread B (nfc_unregister_device):\n  nfc_unregister_device()\n    device_lock(&dev->dev)\n      rfkill_unregister()\n        mutex_lock(&rfkill_global_mutex)  <- waits for rfkill_global_mutex\n\nThis creates a classic ABBA deadlock scenario.\n\nFix this by moving rfkill_unregister() and rfkill_destroy() outside the\ndevice_lock critical section. Store the rfkill pointer in a local variable\nbefore releasing the lock, then call rfkill_unregister() after releasing\ndevice_lock.\n\nThis change is safe because rfkill_fop_write() holds rfkill_global_mutex\nwhile calling the rfkill callbacks, and rfkill_unregister() also acquires\nrfkill_global_mutex before cleanup. Therefore, rfkill_unregister() will\nwait for any ongoing callback to complete before proceeding, and\ndevice_del() is only called after rfkill_unregister() returns, preventing\nany use-after-free.\n\nThe similar lock ordering in nfc_register_device() (device_lock ->\nrfkill_global_mutex via rfkill_register) is safe because during\nregistration the device is not yet in rfkill_list, so no concurrent\nrfkill operations can occur on this

fix off-by-one issues in iavf_config_rss_reg()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niavf: fix off-by-one issues in iavf_config_rss_reg()\n\nThere are off-by-one bugs when configuring RSS hash key and lookup\ntable, causing out-of-bounds reads to memory [1] and out-of-bounds\nwrites to device registers.\n\nBefore commit 43a3d9ba34c9 (\"i40evf: Allow PF driver to configure RSS\"),\nthe loop upper bounds were:\n    i <= I40E_VFQF_{HKEY,HLUT}_MAX_INDEX\nwhich is safe since the value is the last valid index.\n\nThat commit changed the bounds to:\n    i <= adapter->rss_{key,lut}_size / 4\nwhere `rss_{key,lut}_size / 4` is the number of dwords, so the last\nvalid index is `(rss_{key,lut}_size / 4) - 1`. Therefore, using `<=`\naccesses one element past the end.\n\nFix the issues by using `<` instead of `<=`, ensuring we do not exceed\nthe bounds.\n\n[1] KASAN splat about rss_key_size off-by-one\n

fsl-cpm: Check length parity before switching to 16 bit mode","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: fsl-cpm: Check length parity before switching to 16 bit mode\n\nCommit fc96ec826bce (\"spi: fsl-cpm: Use 16 bit mode for large transfers\nwith even size\") failed to make sure that the size is really even\nbefore switching to 16 bit mode. Until recently the problem went\nunnoticed because kernfs uses a pre-allocated bounce buffer of size\nPAGE_SIZE for reading EEPROM.\n\nBut commit 8ad6249c51d0 (\"eeprom: at25: convert to spi-mem

Verify inode mode when loading from disk","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: Verify inode mode when loading from disk\n\nsyzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when\nthe S_IFMT bits of the 16bits \"mode\" field loaded from disk are corrupted.\n\nAccording to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS\n8 and 9. According to [2], the reserved field was explicitly initialized\nwith 0, and that field must remain 0 as long as reserved. Therefore, when\nthe \"mode\" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file must be\nS_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/\nS_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK if dir ==

fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain\n\nsyzbot reported a kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() because the\n`cl_next_free_rec` field of the allocation chain list (next free slot in\nthe chain list) is 0, triggring the BUG_ON(!cl->cl_next_free_rec)\ncondition in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() and panicking the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, an if condition is introduced in ocfs2_claim_suballoc_bits(),\njust before calling ocfs2_find_victim_chain(), the code block in it being\nexecuted when either of the following conditions is true:\n\n1. `cl_next_free_rec` is equal to 0, indicating that there are no free\nchains in the allocation chain list\n2. `cl_next_free_rec` is greater than `cl_count` (the total number of\nchains in the allocation chain list)\n\nEither of them being true is indicative of the fact that there are no\nchains left for usage.\n\nThis is addressed using ocfs2_error(), which prints\nthe error log for debugging purposes, rather than panicking the

indexes array[cnt] instead of array[i]. For cnt <\nARRAY_SIZE(array), this reads an uninitialized entry; for cnt ==\nARRAY_SIZE(array), it is an out-of-bounds read.

provider OF node when probing the\nplatform device is currently only dropped if the set_sync() callback\nfails during DAI probe.\n\nMake sure to drop the reference on platform probe failures (e.g. probe\ndeferral) and on driver unbind.\n\nThis also avoids a potential use-after-free in case the DAI is ever\nreprobed without first rebinding the platform driver.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"5914d285f6b782892a91d6621723fdc41a775b15"},{"fixed":"acda653169e180b1d860dbb6bc5aceb105858394"},{"fixed":"4054a3597d047f3fe87864ef87f399b5d523e6c0"},{"fixed":"bae74771fc5d3b2a9cf6f5aa64596083d032c4a3"},{"fixed":"3752afcc6d80d5525e236e329895ba2cb93bcb26"},{"fixed":"23261f0de09427367e99f39f588e31e2856a690e"}]}],"versions":["v4.14","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4",

Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query\n\nThe ethtool -S command operates across three ioctl calls:\nETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO for the size, ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS for the names, and\nETHTOOL_GSTATS for the values.\n\nIf the number of stats changes between these calls (e.g., due to device\nreconfiguration), userspace's buffer allocation will be incorrect,\npotentially leading to buffer overflow.\n\nDrivers are generally expected to maintain stable stat counts, but some\ndrivers (e.g., mlx5, bnx2x, bna, ksz884x) use dynamic counters, making\nthis scenario possible.\n\nSome drivers try to handle this internally:\n- bnad_get_ethtool_stats() returns early in case stats.n_stats is not\n  equal to the driver's stats count.\n- micrel/ksz884x also makes sure not to write anything beyond\n  stats.n_stats and overflow the buffer.\n\nHowever, both use stats.n_stats which is already assigned with the value\nreturned from get_sset_count(), hence won't solve the issue described\nhere.\n\nChange ethtool_get_strings(), ethtool_get_stats(),\nethtool_get_phy_stats() to not return anything in case of a mismatch\nbetween userspace's size and get_sset_size(), to prevent buffer\noverflow.\nThe returned n_stats value will be equal to zero, to reflect that\nnothing has been returned.\n\nThis could result in one of two cases when using upstream ethtool,\ndepending on when the size change is detected:\n1. When detected in ethtool_get_strings():\n    # ethtool -S eth2\n    no stats available\n\n2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.\n\nBoth cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call\nshould succeed.\n\nOther than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no\noutput/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting\nincorrect/shifted stats.\nI also considered returning an error instead of a \"silent\" response, but\nthat seems more destructive towards userspace apps.\n\nNotes:\n- This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure\n  that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more\n  predictable behavior.\n\n- RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between\n  the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.\n\n- Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that\n  these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications\n  which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,\n  to prevent any

btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb\n\nThis reverts commit 98921dbd00c4e (\"Bluetooth: Use devm_kzalloc in\nbtusb.c file\").\n\nIn btusb_probe(), we use devm_kzalloc() to allocate the btusb data. This\nties the lifetime of all the btusb data to the binding of a driver to\none interface, INTF. In a driver that binds to other interfaces, ISOC\nand DIAG, this is an accident waiting to happen.\n\nThe issue is revealed in btusb_disconnect(), where

fix buffer validation by including null terminator size in EA length","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix buffer validation by including null terminator size in EA length\n\nThe smb2_set_ea function, which handles Extended Attributes (EA),\nwas performing buffer validation checks that incorrectly omitted the size\nof the null terminating

correctly\n\nThe netlink response for RDMA_NL_LS_OP_IP_RESOLVE should always have a\nLS_NLA_TYPE_DGID attribute, it is invalid if it does not.\n\nUse the nl parsing logic properly and call nla_parse_deprecated() to fill\nthe nlattrs array and then directly index that array to get the data for\nthe DGID. Just fail if it is NULL.\n\nRemove the for loop searching for the nla, and squash the validation and\nparsing into one function.\n\nFixes an uninitialized read from the stack triggered by userspace if it\ndoes not provide the DGID to a kernel initiated RDMA_NL_LS_OP_IP_RESOLVE\nquery.\n\n    BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in hex_byte_pack include/linux/hex.h:13 [inline]\n    BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in

fix integer underflow in cffrml_receive()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncaif: fix integer underflow in cffrml_receive()\n\nThe cffrml_receive() function extracts a length field from the packet\nheader and, when FCS is disabled, subtracts 2 from this length without\nvalidating that len >= 2.\n\nIf an attacker sends a malicious packet with a length field of 0 or 1\nto an interface with FCS disabled, the subtraction causes an integer\nunderflow.\n\nThis can lead to memory exhaustion and kernel instability, potential\ninformation disclosure if padding contains uninitialized kernel memory.\n\nFix this by validating that len >= 2 before performing the

invalidate dentry cache on failed whiteout creation","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: invalidate dentry cache on failed whiteout creation\n\nF2FS can mount filesystems with corrupted directory depth values that\nget runtime-clamped to MAX_DIR_HASH_DEPTH. When RENAME_WHITEOUT\noperations are performed on such directories, f2fs_rename performs\ndirectory modifications (updating target entry and deleting source\nentry) before attempting to add the whiteout entry via f2fs_add_link.\n\nIf f2fs_add_link fails due to the corrupted directory structure, the\nfunction returns an error to VFS, but the partial directory\nmodifications have already been committed to disk. VFS assumes the\nentire rename operation failed and does not update the dentry cache,\nleaving stale mappings.\n\nIn the error path, VFS does not call d_move() to update the dentry\ncache. This results in new_dentry still pointing to the old inode\n(new_inode) which has already had its i_nlink decremented to zero.\nThe stale cache causes subsequent operations to incorrectly reference\nthe freed inode.\n\nThis causes subsequent operations to use cached dentry information that\nno longer matches the on-disk state. When a second rename targets the\nsame entry, VFS attempts to decrement i_nlink on the stale inode, which\nmay already have i_nlink=0, triggering a WARNING in drop_nlink().\n\nExample sequence:\n1. First rename (RENAME_WHITEOUT): file2 → file1\n   - f2fs updates file1 entry on disk (points to inode 8)\n   - f2fs deletes file2 entry on disk\n   - f2fs_add_link(whiteout) fails (corrupted directory)\n   - Returns error to VFS\n   - VFS does not call d_move() due to error\n   - VFS cache still has: file1 → inode 7 (stale!)\n   - inode 7 has i_nlink=0 (already decremented)\n\n2. Second rename: file3 → file1\n   - VFS uses stale cache: file1 → inode 7\n   - Tries to drop_nlink on inode 7 (i_nlink already 0)\n   - WARNING in drop_nlink()\n\nFix this by explicitly invalidating old_dentry and new_dentry when\nf2fs_add_link fails during whiteout creation. This forces VFS to\nrefresh from disk on subsequent operations, ensuring cache consistency\neven when the rename partially succeeds.\n\nReproducer:\n1.

sync() and link() are called concurrently, both threads may\nenter hfs_bnode_find() without finding the node in the hash table\nand proceed to create it.\n\nThread A:\n  hfsplus_write_inode()\n    -> hfsplus_write_system_inode()\n      -> hfs_btree_write()\n        -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)\n          -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)\n\nThread B:\n  hfsplus_create_cat()\n    -> hfs_brec_insert()\n      -> hfs_bnode_split()\n        -> hfs_bmap_alloc()\n          -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)\n            -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)\n\nIn this case, thread A creates the bnode, sets refcnt=1, and hashes it.\nThread B also tries to create the same bnode, notices it has already\nbeen inserted, drops its own instance, and uses the hashed one without\ngetting the node.\n\n```\n\n\tnode2 = hfs_bnode_findhash(tree, cnid);\n\tif (!node2) {                                 <- Thread A\n\t\thash = hfs_bnode_hash(cnid);\n\t\tnode->next_hash = tree->node_hash[hash];\n\t\ttree->node_hash[hash] = node;\n\t\ttree->node_hash_cnt++;\n\t} else {                                      <- Thread B\n\t\tspin_unlock(&tree->hash_lock);\n\t\tkfree(node);\n\t\twait_event(node2->lock_wq,\n\t\t\t!test_bit(HFS_BNODE_NEW, &node2->flags));\n\t\treturn node2;\n\t}\n```\n\nHowever, hfs_bnode_find() requires each call to take a reference.\nHere both threads end up setting refcnt=1. When they later put the node,\nthis triggers:\n\nBUG_ON(!atomic_read(&node->refcnt))\n\nIn this scenario, Thread B in fact finds the node in the hash table\nrather than creating a new one, and thus must take a reference.\n\nFix this by calling hfs_bnode_get() when reusing a bnode newly created by\nanother thread to ensure the refcount is updated correctly.\n\nA similar bug was fixed in HFS long

phy: fsl-usb: Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: phy: fsl-usb: Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal\n\nThe delayed work item otg_event is initialized in fsl_otg_conf() and\nscheduled under two conditions:\n1. When a host controller binds to the OTG controller.\n2. When the USB ID pin state changes (cable insertion/removal).\n\nA race condition occurs when the device is removed via fsl_otg_remove():\nthe fsl_otg instance may be freed while the delayed work is still pending\nor executing. This leads to use-after-free when the work function\nfsl_otg_event() accesses the already freed memory.\n\nThe problematic scenario:\n\n(detach thread)            | (delayed work)\nfsl_otg_remove()           |\n  kfree(fsl_otg_dev) //FREE| fsl_otg_event()\n                           |   og = container_of(...) //USE\n                           |   og-> //USE\n\nFix this by calling disable_delayed_work_sync() in fsl_otg_remove()\nbefore deallocating the fsl_otg structure. This ensures the delayed work\nis properly canceled and completes execution prior to memory deallocation.\n\nThis bug was identified through static

vfs: fix race on m_flags in vfs_cache","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: vfs: fix race on m_flags in vfs_cache\n\nksmbd maintains delete-on-close and pending-delete state in\nksmbd_inode->m_flags. In vfs_cache.c this field is accessed under\ninconsistent locking: some paths read and modify m_flags under\nci->m_lock while others do so without taking the lock at all.\n\nExamples:\n\n - ksmbd_query_inode_status() and __ksmbd_inode_close() use\n   ci->m_lock when checking or updating m_flags.\n - ksmbd_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_set_inode_pending_delete(),\n   ksmbd_clear_inode_pending_delete() and ksmbd_fd_set_delete_on_close()\n   used to read and modify m_flags without ci->m_lock.\n\nThis creates a potential data race on m_flags when multiple threads\nopen, close and delete the same file concurrently. In the worst case\ndelete-on-close and pending-delete bits can be lost or observed in an\ninconsistent state, leading to confusing delete semantics (files that\nstay on disk after delete-on-close, or files that disappear while still\nin use).\n\nFix it by:\n\n - Making ksmbd_query_inode_status() look at m_flags under ci->m_lock\n   after dropping inode_hash_lock.\n - Adding ci->m_lock protection to all helpers that read or modify\n   m_flags (ksmbd_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_set_inode_pending_delete(),\n   ksmbd_clear_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_fd_set_delete_on_close()).\n - Keeping the

do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfsnotify: do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files\n\ninotify/fanotify do not allow users with no read access to a file to\nsubscribe to events (e.g. IN_ACCESS/IN_MODIFY), but they do allow the\nsame user to subscribe for watching events on children when the user\nhas access to the parent directory (e.g. /dev).\n\nUsers with no read access to a file but with read access to its parent\ndirectory can still stat the file and see if it was accessed/modified\nvia atime/mtime change.\n\nThe same is not true for special files (e.g. /dev/null). Users will not\ngenerally observe atime/mtime changes when other users read/write to\nspecial files, only when someone sets atime/mtime via utimensat().\n\nAlign fsnotify events with this stat behavior and do not generate\nACCESS/MODIFY events to parent watchers on read/write of special files.\nThe events are still generated to parent watchers on utimensat(). This\ncloses some side-channels that could be possibly used for information\nexfiltration [1].\n\n[1]

lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device\n\nlkkbd_interrupt() schedules lk->tq via schedule_work(), and the work\nhandler lkkbd_reinit() dereferences the lkkbd structure and its\nserio/input_dev fields.\n\nlkkbd_disconnect() and error paths in lkkbd_connect() free the lkkbd\nstructure without preventing the reinit work from being queued again\nuntil serio_close() returns.

applicom: fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nchar: applicom: fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl\n\nDiscovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.\n\nIn ac_ioctl, the validation of IndexCard and the check for a valid\nRamIO pointer are skipped when cmd is 6. However, the function\nunconditionally executes readb(apbs[IndexCard].RamIO + VERS) at the\nend.\n\nIf cmd is 6, IndexCard may reference a board that does not exist\n(where RamIO is NULL), leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFix this by skipping the readb access when cmd is 6, as this\ncommand is a global information query and does not target a specific\nboard

Fix SLB multihit issue during SLB preload","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/64s/slb: Fix SLB multihit issue during SLB preload\n\nOn systems using the hash MMU, there is a software SLB preload cache that\nmirrors the entries loaded into the hardware SLB buffer. This preload\ncache is subject to periodic eviction — typically after every 256 context\nswitches — to remove old entry.\n\nTo optimize performance, the kernel skips switch_mmu_context() in\nswitch_mm_irqs_off() when the prev and next mm_struct are the same.\nHowever, on hash MMU systems, this can lead to inconsistencies between\nthe hardware SLB and the software preload cache.\n\nIf an SLB entry for a process is evicted from the software cache on one\nCPU, and the same process later runs on another CPU without executing\nswitch_mmu_context(), the hardware SLB may retain stale entries. If the\nkernel then attempts to reload that entry, it can trigger an SLB\nmulti-hit error.\n\nThe following timeline shows how stale SLB entries are created and can\ncause a multi-hit error when a process moves between CPUs without a\nMMU context switch.\n\nCPU 0                                   CPU 1\n-----                                    -----\nProcess P\nexec                                    swapper/1\n load_elf_binary\n  begin_new_exc\n    activate_mm\n     switch_mm_irqs_off\n      switch_mmu_context\n       switch_slb\n       /*\n        * This invalidates all\n        * the entries in the HW\n        * and setup the new HW\n        * SLB entries as per the\n        * preload cache.\n        */\ncontext_switch\nsched_migrate_task migrates process P to cpu-1\n\nProcess swapper/0                       context switch (to process P)\n(uses mm_struct of Process P)           switch_mm_irqs_off()\n                                         switch_slb\n                                           load_slb++\n                                            /*\n                                            * load_slb becomes 0 here\n                                            * and we evict an entry from\n                                            * the preload cache with\n                                            * preload_age().

Fix reference count leak when using error routes with nexthop objects","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv4: Fix reference count leak when using error routes with nexthop objects\n\nWhen a nexthop object is deleted, it is marked as dead and then\nfib_table_flush() is called to flush all the routes that are using the\ndead nexthop.\n\nThe current logic in fib_table_flush() is to only flush error routes\n(e.g., blackhole) when it is called as part of network namespace\ndismantle (i.e., with flush_all=true). Therefore, error routes are not\nflushed when their nexthop object is deleted:\n\n # ip link add name dummy1 up type dummy\n # ip nexthop add id 1 dev dummy1\n # ip route add 198.51.100.1/32 nhid 1\n # ip route add blackhole 198.51.100.2/32 nhid 1\n # ip nexthop del id 1\n # ip route show\n blackhole 198.51.100.2 nhid 1 dev dummy1\n\nAs such, they keep holding a reference on the nexthop object which in\nturn holds a reference on the nexthop device, resulting in a reference\ncount leak:\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n [   70.516258] unregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy1 to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nFix by flushing error routes when their nexthop is marked as dead.\n\nIPv6 does not suffer from this problem.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"493ced1ac47c48bb86d9d4e8e87df8592be85a0e"},{"fixed":"30386e090c49e803c0616a7147e43409c32a2b0e"},{"fixed":"5979338c83012110ccd45cae6517591770bfe536"},{"fixed":"ee4183501ea556dca31f5ffd8690aa9fd25b609f"},{"fixed":"e3fc381320d04e4a74311e576a86cac49a16fc43"},{"fixed":"ac782f4e3bfcde145b8a7f8af31d9422d94d172a"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.63","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7"

It leads to UAF on `struct Qdisc` object.\nAttacker requires the capability to create new user and network namespace\nin order to trigger the bug.\nSee my additional commentary at the end of the analysis.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nstatic int ets_qdisc_change(struct Qdisc *sch, struct nlattr *opt,\n                          struct netlink_ext_ack *extack)\n{\n...\n\n      // (1) this lock is preventing .change handler (`ets_qdisc_change`)\n      //to race with .dequeue handler (`ets_qdisc_dequeue`)\n      sch_tree_lock(sch);\n\n      for (i = nbands; i < oldbands; i++) {\n              if (i >= q->nstrict && q->classes[i].qdisc->q.qlen)\n                      list_del_init(&q->classes[i].alist);\n              qdisc_purge_queue(q->classes[i].qdisc);\n      }\n\n      WRITE_ONCE(q->nbands, nbands);\n      for (i = nstrict; i < q->nstrict; i++) {\n              if (q->classes[i].qdisc->q.qlen) {\n\t\t      // (2) the class is added to the q->active\n                      list_add_tail(&q->classes[i].alist, &q->active);\n                      q->classes[i].deficit = quanta[i];\n              }\n      }\n      WRITE_ONCE(q->nstrict, nstrict);\n      memcpy(q->prio2band, priomap, sizeof(priomap));\n\n      for (i = 0; i < q->nbands; i++)\n              WRITE_ONCE(q->classes[i].quantum, quanta[i]);\n\n      for (i = oldbands; i < q->nbands; i++) {\n              q->classes[i].qdisc = queues[i];\n              if (q->classes[i].qdisc != &noop_qdisc)\n                      qdisc_hash_add(q->classes[i].qdisc, true);\n      }\n\n      // (3) the qdisc is unlocked, now dequeue can be called in parallel\n      // to the rest of .change handler\n      sch_tree_unlock(sch);\n\n      ets_offload_change(sch);\n      for (i = q->nbands; i < oldbands; i++) {\n\t      // (4) we're reducing the refcount for our class's qdisc and\n\t      //  freeing it\n              qdisc_put(q->classes[i].qdisc);\n\t      // (5) If we call .dequeue between (4) and (5), we will have\n\t      // a strong UAF and we can control RIP\n              q->classes[i].qdisc = NULL;\n              WRITE_ONCE(q->classes[i].quantum, 0);\n              q->classes[i].deficit = 0;\n              gnet_stats_basic_sync_init(&q->classes[i].bstats);\n              memset(&q->classes[i].qstats, 0, sizeof(q->classes[i].qstats));\n      }\n      return 0;\n}\n\nComment:\nThis happens because some of the classes have their qdiscs assigned to\nNULL, but remain in the active list.

positions\n\niomap_adjust_read_range() assumes that the position and length passed in\nare block-aligned. This is not always the case however, as shown in the\nsyzbot generated case for erofs. This causes too many bytes to be\nskipped for uptodate blocks, which results in returning the incorrect\nposition and length to read in.

disable SVA when CONFIG_X86 is set","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu: disable SVA when CONFIG_X86 is set\n\nPatch series \"Fix stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space\", v7.\n\nThis proposes a fix for a security vulnerability related to IOMMU Shared\nVirtual Addressing (SVA).  In an SVA context, an IOMMU can cache kernel\npage table entries.  When a kernel page table page is freed and\nreallocated for another purpose, the IOMMU might still hold stale,\nincorrect entries.  This can be exploited to cause a use-after-free or\nwrite-after-free condition, potentially leading to privilege escalation or\ndata corruption.\n\nThis solution introduces a deferred freeing mechanism for kernel page\ntable pages, which provides a safe window to notify the IOMMU to\ninvalidate its caches before the page is reused.\n\n\nThis patch (of 8):\n\nIn the IOMMU Shared Virtual Addressing (SVA) context, the IOMMU hardware\nshares and walks the CPU's page tables.  The x86 architecture maps the\nkernel's virtual address space into the upper portion of every process's\npage table.  Consequently, in an SVA context, the IOMMU hardware can walk\nand cache kernel page table entries.\n\nThe Linux kernel currently lacks a notification mechanism for kernel page\ntable changes, specifically when page table pages are freed and reused. \nThe IOMMU driver is only notified of changes to user virtual address\nmappings.  This can cause the IOMMU's internal caches to retain stale\nentries for kernel VA.\n\nUse-After-Free (UAF) and Write-After-Free (WAF) conditions arise when\nkernel page table pages are freed and later reallocated.  The IOMMU could\nmisinterpret the new data as valid page table entries.  The IOMMU might\nthen walk into attacker-controlled memory, leading to arbitrary physical\nmemory DMA access or privilege escalation.  This is also a\nWrite-After-Free issue, as the IOMMU will potentially continue to write\nAccessed and Dirty bits to the freed memory while attempting to walk the\nstale page tables.\n\nCurrently, SVA contexts are unprivileged and cannot access kernel\nmappings.  However, the IOMMU will still walk kernel-only page tables all\nthe way down to the leaf entries, where it realizes the mapping is for the\nkernel and errors out.  This means the IOMMU still caches these\nintermediate page table entries, making the described vulnerability a real\nconcern.\n\nDisable SVA on x86 architecture until the IOMMU can receive notification\nto flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel page table

hp-bioscfg: Fix out-of-bounds array access in ACPI package parsing","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix out-of-bounds array access in ACPI package parsing\n\nThe hp_populate_*_elements_from_package() functions in the hp-bioscfg\ndriver contain out-of-bounds array access vulnerabilities.\n\nThese functions parse ACPI packages into internal data structures using\na for loop with index variable 'elem' that iterates through\nenum_obj/integer_obj/order_obj/password_obj/string_obj arrays.\n\nWhen processing multi-element fields like PREREQUISITES and\nENUM_POSSIBLE_VALUES, these functions read multiple consecutive array\nelements using expressions like 'enum_obj[elem + reqs]' and\n'enum_obj[elem +

changes the bounds check to validate the actual accessed

hns3: using the num_tqps in the vf driver to apply for resources","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hns3: using the num_tqps in the vf driver to apply for resources\n\nCurrently, hdev->htqp is allocated using hdev->num_tqps, and kinfo->tqp\nis allocated using kinfo->num_tqps. However, kinfo->num_tqps is set to\nmin(new_tqps, hdev->num_tqps);  Therefore, kinfo->num_tqps may be smaller\nthan hdev->num_tqps, which causes some hdev->htqp[i] to remain\nuninitialized in

don't log conflicting inode if it's a dir moved in the current transaction","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: don't log conflicting inode if it's a dir moved in the current transaction\n\nWe can't log a conflicting inode if it's a directory and it was moved\nfrom one parent directory to another parent directory in the current\ntransaction, as this can result an attempt to have a directory with\ntwo hard links during log replay, one for the old parent directory and\nanother for the new parent directory.\n\nThe following scenario triggers that issue:\n\n1) We have directories \"dir1\" and \"dir2\" created in a past transaction.\n   Directory \"dir1\" has inode A as its parent directory;\n\n2) We move \"dir1\" to some other directory;\n\n3) We create a file with the name \"dir1\" in directory inode A;\n\n4) We fsync the new file. This results in logging the inode of the new file\n   and the inode for the directory \"dir1\" that was previously moved in the\n   current transaction. So the log tree has the INODE_REF item for the\n   new location of \"dir1\";\n\n5) We move the new file to some other directory. This results in updating\n   the log tree to included the new INODE_REF for the new location of the\n   file and removes the INODE_REF for the old location. This happens\n   during the rename when we call btrfs_log_new_name();\n\n6) We fsync the file, and that persists the log tree changes done in the\n   previous step (btrfs_log_new_name() only updates the log tree in\n   memory);\n\n7) We have a power failure;\n\n8) Next time the fs is mounted, log replay happens and when processing\n   the inode for directory \"dir1\" we find a new INODE_REF and add that\n   link, but we don't remove the old link of the inode since we have\n   not logged the old parent directory of the directory inode \"dir1\".\n\nAs a result after log replay finishes when we trigger writeback of the\nsubvolume tree's extent buffers, the tree check will detect that we have\na directory a hard link count of 2 and we get a mount failure.\nThe errors and stack traces reported in dmesg/syslog are like this:\n\n   [ 3845.729764] BTRFS info (device dm-0): start tree-log replay\n   [ 3845.730304] page: refcount:3 mapcount:0 mapping:000000005c8a3027 index:0x1d00 pfn:0x11510c\n

usb-mixer: us16x08: validate meter packet indices","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-mixer: us16x08: validate meter packet indices\n\nget_meter_levels_from_urb() parses the 64-byte meter packets sent by\nthe device and fills the per-channel arrays meter_level[],\ncomp_level[] and master_level[] in struct snd_us16x08_meter_store.\n\nCurrently the function derives the channel index directly from the\nmeter packet (MUB2(meter_urb, s) - 1) and uses it to index those\narrays without validating the range.

alps - fix use-after-free bugs caused by dev3_register_work","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: alps - fix use-after-free bugs caused by dev3_register_work\n\nThe dev3_register_work delayed work item is initialized within\nalps_reconnect() and scheduled upon receipt of the first bare\nPS/2 packet from an external PS/2 device connected to the ALPS\ntouchpad. During device detachment, the original implementation\ncalls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure\ncompletion of dev3_register_work. However, the flush_workqueue()\nin psmouse_disconnect() only blocks and waits for work items that\nwere already queued to the workqueue prior to its invocation. Any\nwork items submitted after flush_workqueue() is called are not\nincluded in the set of tasks that the flush operation awaits.\nThis means that after flush_workqueue() has finished executing,\nthe dev3_register_work could still be scheduled. Although the\npsmouse state is set to PSMOUSE_CMD_MODE in psmouse_disconnect(),\nthe scheduling of dev3_register_work remains unaffected.\n\nThe race condition can occur as follows:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup path)     | CPU 1 (delayed work)\npsmouse_disconnect()     |\n  psmouse_set_state()    |\n  flush_workqueue()      | alps_report_bare_ps2_packet()\n  alps_disconnect()      |   psmouse_queue_work()\n    kfree(priv); // FREE | alps_register_bare_ps2_mouse()\n                         |   priv = container_of(work...); // USE\n                         |   priv->dev3 // USE\n\nAdd

openvswitch: fix middle attribute validation in push_nsh() action","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: openvswitch: fix middle attribute validation in push_nsh() action\n\nThe push_nsh() action structure looks like this:\n\n OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PUSH_NSH(OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH(OVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE,...))\n\nThe outermost OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PUSH_NSH attribute is OK'ed by the\nnla_for_each_nested() inside __ovs_nla_copy_actions().  The innermost\nOVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE/MD1/MD2 are OK'ed by the nla_for_each_nested()\ninside nsh_key_put_from_nlattr().  But nothing checks if the attribute\nin the middle is OK.  We don't even check that this attribute is the\nOVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH.  We just do a double unwrap with a pair of nla_data()\ncalls - first time directly while calling validate_push_nsh() and the\nsecond time as part of the nla_for_each_nested() macro, which isn't\nsafe, potentially causing invalid memory access if the size of this\nattribute is incorrect.  The failure may not be noticed during\nvalidation due to larger netlink buffer, but cause trouble later during\naction execution where the buffer is allocated exactly to the size:\n\n BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in nsh_hdr_from_nlattr+0x1dd/0x6a0 [openvswitch]\n Read of size 184 at addr ffff88816459a634 by task a.out/22624\n\n CPU: 8 UID: 0 PID: 22624 6.18.0-rc7+ #115 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  dump_stack_lvl+0x51/0x70\n  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x390\n  kasan_report+0xdd/0x110\n  kasan_check_range+0x35/0x1b0\n  __asan_memcpy+0x20/0x60\n  nsh_hdr_from_nlattr+0x1dd/0x6a0 [openvswitch]\n  push_nsh+0x82/0x120 [openvswitch]\n  do_execute_actions+0x1405/0x2840 [openvswitch]\n  ovs_execute_actions+0xd5/0x3b0 [openvswitch]\n  ovs_packet_cmd_execute+0x949/0xdb0 [openvswitch]\n  genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x1d6/0x2b0\n  genl_family_rcv_msg+0x336/0x580\n  genl_rcv_msg+0x9f/0x130\n  netlink_rcv_skb+0x11f/0x370\n  genl_rcv+0x24/0x40\n  netlink_unicast+0x73e/0xaa0\n  netlink_sendmsg+0x744/0xbf0\n  __sys_sendto+0x3d6/0x450\n  do_syscall_64+0x79/0x2c0\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n  </TASK>\n\nLet's add some checks that the attribute is properly sized and it's\nthe only one attribute inside the action.  Technically, there is no\nreal reason for OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH to be there, as we know that we're\npushing an NSH header already, it just creates extra nesting, but\nthat's how uAPI works today.  So, keeping as it is.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b2d0f5d5dc53532e6f07bc546a476a55ebdfe0f3"},{"fixed":"1b569db9c2f28b599e40050524aae5f7332bc294"},{"fixed":"10ffc558246f2c75619aedda0921906095e46702"},{"fixed":"2ecfc4433acdb149eafd7fb22d7fd4adf90b25e9"},{"fixed":"c999153bfb2d1d9b295b7010d920f2a7c6d7595f"},{"fixed":"5ace7ef87f059d68b5f50837ef3e8a1a4870c36e"}]}],"versions":["v4.14","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-r

fix the open/removal races","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfunctionfs: fix the open/removal races\n\nffs_epfile_open() can race with removal, ending up with file->private_data\npointing to freed object.\n\nThere is a total count of opened files on functionfs (both ep0 and\ndynamic ones) and when it hits zero, dynamic files get removed.\nUnfortunately, that removal can happen while another thread is\nin ffs_epfile_open(), but has not incremented the count yet.\nIn that case open will succeed, leaving us with UAF on any subsequent\nread() or write().\n\nThe root cause is that ffs->opened is misused; atomic_dec_and_test() vs.\natomic_add_return() is not a good idea, when object remains visible all\nalong.\n\nTo untangle that\n\t* serialize openers on ffs->mutex (both for ep0 and for dynamic files)\n\t* have dynamic ones use atomic_inc_not_zero() and fail if we had\nzero ->opened; in that case the file we are

cleanup.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b9445598d8c60a1379887b957024b71343965f74"},{"fixed":"8f44c4a550570cd5903625133f938c6b51310c9b"},{"fixed":"18b99fa603d0df5e1c898699c17d3b92ddc80746"},{"fixed":"e232269d511566b1f80872256a48593acc1becf4"},{"fixed":"7fbfb85b05bc960cc50e09d03e5e562131e48d45"},{"fixed":"b14fad555302a2104948feaff70503b64c80ac01"}]}],"versions":["v5.14","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.63","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.100","v6.6.101","v6.6.102","v6.6.103","v6.6.104","v6.6.105","v6.6.106","v6.6.107","v6.6.108","v6.6.109","v6.6.11","v6.6.110","v6.6.111","v6.6.112","v6.6.113","v6.6.114","v6.6.115","v6.6.116","v6.6.117","v6.6.118","v6.6.

spectrum_router: Fix neighbour use-after-free","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix neighbour use-after-free\n\nWe sometimes observe use-after-free when dereferencing a neighbour [1].\nThe problem seems to be that the driver stores a pointer to the\nneighbour, but without holding a reference on it. A reference is only\ntaken when the neighbour is used by a nexthop.\n\nFix by simplifying the reference counting scheme. Always take a\nreference when storing a neighbour pointer in a neighbour entry. Avoid\ntaking a referencing when the neighbour is used by a nexthop as the\nneighbour entry associated with the nexthop already holds a reference.\n\nTested by running the test that uncovered the problem over 300 times.\nWithout this patch the problem was reproduced after a handful of\niterations.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mlxsw_sp_neigh_entry_update+0x2d4/0x310\nRead of size

ef56081d1864 (\"RDMA/bnxt_re: RoCE related hardware counters\nupdate\") added three new counters and placed them after\nBNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR.\n\nBNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR acts as a boundary marker for allocating hardware\nstatistics with different num_counters values on chip_gen_p5_p7 devices.\n\nAs a result, BNXT_RE_NUM_STD_COUNTERS are used when allocating\nhw_stats, which leads to an

clean up user copy references on ublk server exit","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nublk: clean up user copy references on ublk server exit\n\nIf a ublk server process releases a ublk char device file, any requests\ndispatched to the ublk server but not yet completed will retain a ref\nvalue of UBLK_REFCOUNT_INIT. Before commit e63d2228ef83 (\"ublk: simplify\naborting ublk request\"), __ublk_fail_req() would decrement the reference\ncount before completing the failed request. However, that commit\noptimized __ublk_fail_req() to call __ublk_complete_rq() directly\nwithout decrementing the request reference count.\nThe leaked reference count incorrectly allows user copy and zero copy\noperations on the completed ublk request. It also triggers the\nWARN_ON_ONCE(refcount_read(&io->ref)) warnings in ublk_queue_reinit()\nand ublk_deinit_queue().\nCommit c5c5eb24ed61 (\"ublk: avoid ublk_io_release() called after ublk\nchar dev is closed\") already fixed the issue for ublk devices using\nUBLK_F_SUPPORT_ZERO_COPY or UBLK_F_AUTO_BUF_REG. However, the reference\ncount leak also affects UBLK_F_USER_COPY, the other reference-counted\ndata copy mode. Fix the condition in ublk_check_and_reset_active_ref()\nto include all reference-counted data copy modes. This ensures that any\nublk requests still owned by the ublk server when it exits have their\nreference counts reset to

fix recovery on rename failures","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nshmem: fix recovery on rename failures\n\nmaple_tree insertions can fail if we are seriously short on memory;\nsimple_offset_rename() does not recover well if it runs into that.\nThe same goes for simple_offset_rename_exchange().\n\nMoreover, shmem_whiteout() expects that if it succeeds, the caller will\nprogress to d_move(), i.e. that shmem_rename2() won't fail past the\nsuccessful call of shmem_whiteout().\n\nNot hard to fix, fortunately - mtree_store() can't fail if the index we\nare trying to store into is already present in the tree as a singleton.\n\nFor simple_offset_rename_exchange() that's enough - we just need to be\ncareful about the order of

However in doing so, fuse_prepare_release() now skips\ngrabbing the reference on the inode, which makes it possible for an\ninode to be evicted from the dcache while there are inflight readahead\nrequests. This causes a deadlock if the server triggers reclaim while\nservicing the readahead request and reclaim attempts to evict the inode\nof the file being read ahead. Since the folio is locked during\nreadahead, when reclaim evicts the fuse inode and fuse_evict_inode()\nattempts to remove all folios associated with the inode from the page\ncache (truncate_inode_pages_range()), reclaim will block forever waiting\nfor the lock since readahead cannot relinquish the lock because it is\nitself blocked in reclaim:\n\n>>> stack_trace(1504735)\n folio_wait_bit_common (mm/filemap.c:1308:4)\n folio_lock (./include/linux/pagemap.h:1052:3)\n truncate_inode_pages_range (mm/truncate.c:336:10)\n fuse_evict_inode (fs/fuse/inode.c:161:2)\n evict (fs/inode.c:704:3)\n dentry_unlink_inode (fs/dcache.c:412:3)\n __dentry_kill (fs/dcache.c:615:3)\n shrink_kill (fs/dcache.c:1060:12)\n shrink_dentry_list (fs/dcache.c:1087:3)\n prune_dcache_sb (fs/dcache.c:1168:2)\n super_cache_scan (fs/super.c:221:10)\n do_shrink_slab (mm/shrinker.c:435:9)\n shrink_slab (mm/shrinker.c:626:10)\n shrink_node (mm/vmscan.c:5951:2)\n shrink_zones (mm/vmscan.c:6195:3)\n do_try_to_free_pages (mm/vmscan.c:6257:3)\n do_swap_page (mm/memory.c:4136:11)\n handle_pte_fault (mm/memory.c:5562:10)\n handle_mm_fault (mm/memory.c:5870:9)\n do_user_addr_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1338:10)\n handle_page_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1481:3)\n exc_page_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1539:2)\n asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x27\n\nFix this deadlock by allocating ff->release_args and grabbing the\nreference on the inode when preparing the file for release even if the\nserver does not implement open.

duplicate handshake cancellations leak socket","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/handshake: duplicate handshake cancellations leak socket\n\nWhen a handshake request is cancelled it is removed from the\nhandshake_net->hn_requests list, but it is still present in the\nhandshake_rhashtbl until it is destroyed.\n\nIf a second cancellation request arrives for the same handshake request,\nthen remove_pending() will return false... and assuming\nHANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED isn't set in req->hr_flags, we'll continue\nprocessing through the out_true label, where we put another reference on\nthe sock and a refcount underflow occurs.\n\nThis can happen for example if a handshake times out - particularly if\nthe SUNRPC client sends the AUTH_TLS probe to the server but doesn't\nfollow it up with the ClientHello due to a problem with tlshd.  When the\ntimeout is hit on the server, the server will send a FIN, which triggers\na cancellation request via xs_reset_transport().

udev) opens ublk block device (e.g., to read\nthe partition table via bdev_open()), a deadlock[1] can occur:\n\n1. bdev_open() grabs disk->open_mutex\n2. The process issues read I/O to ublk backend to read partition table\n3. In __ublk_complete_rq(), blk_update_request() or blk_mq_end_request()\n   runs bio->bi_end_io() callbacks\n4. If this triggers fput() on file descriptor of ublk block device, the\n   work may be deferred to current task's task work (see fput() implementation)\n5. This eventually calls blkdev_release() from the same context\n6. blkdev_release() tries to grab disk->open_mutex again\n7. Deadlock: same task waiting for a mutex it already holds\n\nThe fix is to run blk_update_request() and blk_mq_end_request() with bottom\nhalves disabled.

spectrum_mr: Fix use-after-free when updating multicast route stats","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_mr: Fix use-after-free when updating multicast route stats\n\nCited commit added a dedicated mutex (instead of RTNL) to protect the\nmulticast route list, so that it will not change while the driver\nperiodically traverses it in order to update the kernel about multicast\nroute stats that were queried from the device.\n\nOne instance of list entry deletion (during route replace) was missed\nand it can result in a use-after-free [1].\n\nFix by acquiring the mutex before deleting the entry from the list and\nreleasing it afterwards.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mlxsw_sp_mr_stats_update+0x4a5/0x540

NFSv4 file creation neglects setting ACL","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFSD: NFSv4 file creation neglects setting ACL\n\nAn NFSv4 client that sets an ACL with a named principal during file\ncreation retrieves the ACL afterwards, and finds that it is only a\ndefault ACL (based on the mode bits) and not the ACL that was\nrequested during file creation. This violates RFC 8881 section\n6.4.1.3: \"the ACL attribute is set as given\".\n\nThe issue occurs in nfsd_create_setattr(), which calls\nnfsd_attrs_valid() to determine whether to call nfsd_setattr().\nHowever, nfsd_attrs_valid() checks only for iattr changes and\nsecurity labels, but not POSIX ACLs. When only an ACL is present,\nthe function returns false, nfsd_setattr() is skipped, and the\nPOSIX ACL is never applied to the inode.\n\nSubsequently, when the client retrieves the ACL, the server finds\nno POSIX ACL on the inode and returns one generated from the file's\nmode bits rather than returning the originally-specified

Fix XDP_TX path","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbnxt_en: Fix XDP_TX path\n\nFor XDP_TX action in bnxt_rx_xdp(), clearing of the event flags is not\ncorrect.  __bnxt_poll_work() -> bnxt_rx_pkt() -> bnxt_rx_xdp() may be\nlooping within NAPI and some event flags may be set in earlier\niterations.  In particular, if BNXT_TX_EVENT is set earlier indicating\nsome XDP_TX packets are ready and pending, it will be cleared if it is\nXDP_TX action again.  Normally, we will set BNXT_TX_EVENT again when we\nsuccessfully call __bnxt_xmit_xdp().  But if the TX ring has no more\nroom, the flag will not be set.  This will cause the TX producer to be\nahead but the driver will not hit the TX doorbell.\n\nFor multi-buf XDP_TX, there is no need to clear the event flags and set\nBNXT_AGG_EVENT.  The BNXT_AGG_EVENT flag should have been set earlier in\nbnxt_rx_pkt().\n\nThe visible symptom of this is that the RX ring associated with the\nTX XDP ring will eventually become empty and all packets will be dropped.\nBecause this condition will cause the driver to not refill the RX ring\nseeing that the TX ring has forever pending XDP_TX packets.\n\nThe fix is to only clear BNXT_RX_EVENT when we have successfully\ncalled __bnxt_xmit_xdp().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7f0a168b0441ef7fd6b46563efb2706c58ac2a4c"},{"fixed":"4b83902a1e67ff327ab5c6c65021a03e72c081d6"},{"fixed":"f17e0c1208485b24d61271bc1ddc8f2087e71561"},{"fixed":"0373d5c387f24de749cc22e694a14b3a7c7eb515"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.63","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.18.2","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68770.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.8.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.64"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68770.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0373d5c387f24de749cc22e694a14b3a7c7eb515"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b83902a1e67ff327ab5c6c65021a03e72c081d6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f17e0c1208485b24d61271bc1ddc8f2087e71561"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68770.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68770"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68770.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-14T01:14:03.081379Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68784","published":"2026-01-13T15:28:58.255Z","modified":"2026-01-13T20:02:46.225618Z","summary":"xfs: fix a UAF problem in xattr repair","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfs: fix a UAF problem in xattr repair\n\nThe xchk_setup_xattr_buf function can allocate a new value buffer, which\nmeans that any reference to ab->value before the call could become a\ndangling pointer.

The stuck task was usually modprobe (often loading\na driver like ipvlan), trying to take the lock as a Writer.\nlockdep does not track readers for rwsems so the read wasn't obvious\nfrom the reports.\n\nOn closer inspection the Reader holding the lock was conntrack looping\nforever in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list(). Based on past experience\nwith occasional NIPA crashes I looked thru the tests which run before\nthe crash and noticed that the crash follows ip_defrag.sh. An immediate\nred flag. Scouring thru (de)fragmentation queues reveals skbs sitting\naround, holding conntrack references.\n\nThe problem is that since conntrack depends on nf_defrag_ipv6,\nnf_defrag_ipv6 will load first. Since nf_defrag_ipv6 loads first its\nnetns exit hooks run _after_ conntrack's netns exit hook.\n\nFlush all fragment queue SKBs during fqdir_pre_exit() to release\nconntrack references before conntrack cleanup runs.

existing memslot\n\nReject attempts to disable KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on a memslot that was\ninitially created with a guest_memfd binding, as KVM doesn't support\ntoggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on existing memslots.  KVM prevents enabling\nKVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD, but doesn't prevent clearing the flag.\n\nFailure to reject the new memslot results in a use-after-free due to KVM\nnot unbinding from the guest_memfd instance.  Unbinding on a FLAGS_ONLY\nchange is easy enough, and can/will be done as a hardening measure (in\nanticipation of KVM supporting dirty logging on guest_memfd at some point),\nbut fixing the

During mount,\nget_tree_bdev_flags() calls sb_set_blocksize(sb, block_size(bdev)),\nbut since block_size(bdev) > PAGE_SIZE, sb_set_blocksize() leaves\nsb->s_blocksize at zero.\n\nLater, ntfs_init_from_boot() attempts to read the boot_block while\nsb->s_blocksize is still zero, which triggers the bug.\n\n[almaz.alexandrovich@paragon-software.com: changed comment style, added\nreturn

only set free_cpus for online runqueues","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/deadline: only set free_cpus for online runqueues\n\nCommit 16b269436b72 (\"sched/deadline: Modify cpudl::free_cpus\nto reflect rd->online\") introduced the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu\nfunctions to allow the cpu_dl::free_cpus mask to be manipulated\nby the deadline scheduler class rq_on/offline callbacks so the\nmask would also reflect this state.\n\nCommit 9659e1eeee28 (\"sched/deadline: Remove cpu_active_mask\nfrom cpudl_find()\") removed the check of the cpu_active_mask to\nsave some processing on the premise that the cpudl::free_cpus\nmask already reflected the runqueue online state.\n\nUnfortunately, there are cases where it is possible for the\ncpudl_clear function to set the free_cpus bit for a CPU when the\ndeadline runqueue is offline. When this occurs while a CPU is\nconnected to the default root domain the flag may retain the bad\nstate after the CPU has been unplugged. Later, a different CPU\nthat is transitioning through the default root domain may push a\ndeadline task to the powered down CPU when cpudl_find sees its\nfree_cpus bit is set. If this happens the task will not have the\nopportunity to run.\n\nOne example is outlined here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250110233010.2339521-1-opendmb@gmail.com\n\nAnother occurs when the last deadline task is migrated from a\nCPU that has an offlined runqueue. The dequeue_task member of\nthe deadline scheduler class will eventually call cpudl_clear\nand set the free_cpus bit for the CPU.\n\nThis commit modifies the cpudl_clear function to be aware of the\nonline state of the deadline runqueue so that the free_cpus mask\ncan be updated appropriately.\n\nIt is no longer necessary to manage the mask outside of the\ncpudl_set/clear functions so the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu\nfunctions are removed. In addition, since the free_cpus mask is\nnow only updated under the cpudl lock the code was changed to\nuse the non-atomic __cpumask

fix ipv4 null-ptr-deref in route error path","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipvs: fix ipv4 null-ptr-deref in route error path\n\nThe IPv4 code path in __ip_vs_get_out_rt() calls dst_link_failure()\nwithout ensuring skb->dev is set, leading to a NULL pointer dereference\nin fib_compute_spec_dst() when ipv4_link_failure() attempts to send\nICMP destination unreachable messages.\n\nThe issue emerged after commit ed0de45a1008 (\"ipv4: recompile ip options\nin ipv4_link_failure\") started calling __ip_options_compile() from\nipv4_link_failure(). This code path eventually calls fib_compute_spec_dst()\nwhich dereferences skb->dev. An attempt was made to fix the NULL skb->dev\ndereference in commit 0113d9c9d1cc (\"ipv4: fix null-deref in\nipv4_link_failure\"), but it only addressed the immediate dev_net(skb->dev)\ndereference by using a fallback device. The fix was incomplete because\nfib_compute_spec_dst() later in the call chain still accesses skb->dev\ndirectly, which remains NULL when IPVS calls dst_link_failure().\n\nThe crash occurs when:\n1. IPVS processes a packet in NAT mode with a misconfigured destination\n2. Route lookup fails in __ip_vs_get_out_rt() before establishing a route\n3. The error path calls dst_link_failure(skb) with skb->dev == NULL\n4. ipv4_link_failure() → ipv4_send_dest_unreach() →\n   __ip_options_compile() → fib_compute_spec_dst()\n5. fib_compute_spec_dst() dereferences NULL skb->dev\n\nApply the same fix used for IPv6 in commit 326bf17ea5d4 (\"ipvs: fix\nipv6 route unreach panic\"): set skb->dev from skb_dst(skb)->dev before\ncalling dst_link_failure().\n\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000328-0x000000000000032f]\nCPU: 1 PID: 12732 Comm: syz.1.3469 Not tainted 6.6.114 #2\nRIP: 0010:__in_dev_get_rcu

multiq3: sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: multiq3: sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()\n\nSyzbot identified an issue [1] in multiq3_attach() that induces a\ntask timeout due to open() or COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl operations,\nspecifically, in the case of multiq3 driver.\n\nThis problem arose when syzkaller managed to craft weird configuration\noptions used to specify the number of channels in encoder subdevice.\nIf a particularly great number is passed to s->n_chan in\nmultiq3_attach() via it->options[2], then multiple calls to\nmultiq3_encoder_reset() at the end of driver-specific attach() method\nwill be running for minutes, thus blocking tasks and affected devices\nas well.\n\nWhile this issue is most likely not too dangerous for real-life\ndevices, it still makes sense to sanitize configuration inputs. Enable\na sensible limit on the number of encoder chips (4 chips max, each\nwith 2 channels) to stop this behaviour from manifesting.\n\n[1] Syzbot crash:\nINFO: task syz.2.19:6067 blocked for more

Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()\n\nIf track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple\ntree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over\nthe dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied\nany page tables.\n\nConsequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the\nPAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page\ntable was not copied.\n\nThe easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA\nif track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about \"simply\"\nclearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()\nand performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll\nsimply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...\nwhich is also wrong.\n\nSo let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation\nsucceeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if\nanything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT\nflag after undoing the reservation.\n\nNote that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will\nget removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set\nthen, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be\nhappy. Note that leaving these page tables in place without a reservation\nis not a problem, as we are aborting fork(); this process will never run.\n\nA reproducer can trigger this usually at the first
