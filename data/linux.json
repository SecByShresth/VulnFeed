xfrm_state_delete_tunnel at destroy time for states that were never added\n\nIn commit b441cf3f8c4b (\"xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x\"), I\nmissed the case where state creation fails between full\ninitialization (->init_state has been called) and being inserted on\nthe lists.\n\nIn this situation, ->init_state has been called, so for IPcomp\ntunnels, the fallback tunnel has been created and added onto the\nlists, but the user state never gets added, because we fail before\nthat. The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we\ndon't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up\nleaking the FB tunnel.\n\nThere are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in\nboth net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,\nxfrm_state_migrate). A \"proper\" rollback of the init_state work would\nprobably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets\nmore complicated as multiple states may be involved.\n\nAt some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call\nxfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states\nwill have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,\nwhich solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)\naimed at.

If a reference to that user state still\nexists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,\ntriggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining\nreferences, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 (\"xfrm: destroy xfrm_state\nsynchronously on net exit path\") is not complete.\n\nWe recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of\nskbs (commit 9b6412e6979f (\"tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we\ncurrently drop dst\")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs\nwith a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns\ndestruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the\ntime xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)\nxfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding\nfallback state.\n\nInstead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,\nthis patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the\nfallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been\ndeleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is\ndropped.\n\nA separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since\nwe're going to lock x->tunnel while x is locked.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"9d4139c76905833afcb77fe8ccc17f302a0eb9ab"},{"fixed":"dc3636912d41770466543623cb76e7b88fdb42c7"},{"fixed":"b441cf3f8c4b8576639d20c8eb4aa32917602ecd"}]}],"versions":["v2.6.28","v2.6.28-rc7","v2.6.28-rc8","v2.6.28-rc9","v2.6.29","v2.6.29-rc1","v2.6.29-rc2","v2.6.29-rc3","v2.6.29-rc4","v2.6.29-rc5","v2.6.29-rc6","v2.6.29-rc7","v2.6.29-rc8","v2.6.30","v2.6.30-rc1","v2.6.30-rc2","v2.6.30-rc3","v2.6.30-rc4","v2.6.30-rc5","v2.6.30-rc6","v2.6.30-rc7","v2.6.30-rc8","v2.6.31","v2.6.31-rc1","v2.6.31-rc2","v2.6.31-rc3","v2.6.31-rc4","v2.6.31-rc5","v2.6.31-rc6","v2.6.31-rc7","v2.6.31-rc8","v2.6.31-rc9","v2.6.32","v2.6.32-rc1","v2.6.32-rc2","v2.6.32-rc3","v2.6.32-rc4","v2.6.32-rc5","v2.6.32-rc6","v2.6.32-rc7","v2.6.32-rc8","v2.6.33","v2.6.33-rc1","v2.6.33-rc2","v2.6.33-rc3","v2.6.33-rc4","v2.6.33-rc5","v2.6.33-rc6","v2.6.33-rc7","v2.6.33-rc8","v2.6.34","v2.6.34-rc1","v2.6.34-rc2","v2.6.34-rc3","v2.6.34-rc4","v2.6.34-rc5","v2.6.34-rc6","v2.6.34-rc7","v2.6.35","v2.6.35-rc1","v2.6.35-rc2","v2.6.35-rc3","v2.6.35-rc4","v2.6.35-rc5","v2.6.35-rc6","v2.6.36","v2.6.36-rc1","v2.6.36-rc2","v2.6.36-rc3","v2.6.36-rc4","v2.6.36-rc5","v2.6.36-rc6","v2.6.36-rc7","v2.6.36-rc8","v2.6.37","v2.6.37-rc1","v2.6.37-rc2","v2.6.37-rc3","v2.6.37-rc4","v2.6.37-rc5","v2.6.37-rc6","v2.6.37-rc7","v2.6.37-rc8","v2.6.38","v2.6.38-rc1","v2.6.38-rc2","v2.6.38-rc3","v2.6.38-rc4","v2.6.38-rc5","v2.6.38-rc6","v2.6.38-rc7","v2.6.38-rc8","v2.6.39","v2.6.39-rc1","v2.6.39-rc2","v2.6.39-rc3","v2.6.39-rc4","v2.6.39-rc5","v2.6.39-rc6","v2.6.39-rc7","v3.0","v3.0-rc1","v3.0-rc2","v3.0-rc3","v3.0-rc4","v3.0-rc5","v3.0-rc6","v3.0-rc7","v3.1","v3.1-rc1","v3.1-rc10","v3.1-rc2","v3.1-rc3","v3.1-rc4","v3.1-rc5","v3.1-rc6","v3.1-rc7","v3.1-rc8","v3.1-rc9","v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.13-rc4","v3.13-rc5","v3.13-rc6","v3.13-rc7","v3.13-rc8","v3.14","v3.14-rc1","v3.14-rc2","v3.14-rc3","v3.14-rc4","v3.14-rc5","v3.14-rc6","v3.14-rc7","v3.14-rc8","v3.15","v3.15-rc1","v3.15-rc2","v3.15-rc3","v3.15-rc4","v3.15-rc5","v3.15-rc6","v3.15-rc7","v3.15-rc8","v3.16","v3.16-rc1","v3.16-rc2","v3.16-rc3","v3.16-rc4","v3.16-rc5","v3.16-rc6","v3.16-rc7","v3.17","v3.17-rc1","v3.17-rc2","v3.17-rc3","v3.17-rc4","v3.17-rc5","v3.17-rc6","v3.17-rc7","v3.18","v3.18-rc1","v3.18-rc2","v3.18-rc3","v3.18-rc4","v3.18-rc5","v3.18-rc6","v3.18-rc7","v3.19","v3.19-rc1","v3.19-rc2","v3.19-rc3","v3.19-rc4","v3.19-rc5","v3.19-rc6","v3.19-rc7","v3.2","v3.2-rc1","v3.2-rc2","v3.2-rc3","v3.2-rc4","v3.2-rc5","v3.2-rc6","v3.2-rc7","v3.3","v3.3-rc1","v3.3-rc2","v3.3-rc3","v3.3-rc4","v3.3-rc5","v3.3-rc6","v3.3-rc7","v3.4","v3.4-rc1","v3.4-rc2","v3.4-rc3","v3.4-rc4","v3.4-rc5","v3.4-rc6","v3.4-rc7","v3.5","v3.5-rc1","v3.5-rc2","v3.5-rc3","v3.5-rc4","v3.5-rc5","v3.5-rc6","v3.5-rc7","v3.6","v3.6-rc1","v3.6-rc2","v3.6-rc3","v3.6-rc4","v3.6-rc5","v3.6-rc6","v3.6-rc7","v3.7","v3.7-rc1","v3.7-rc2","v3.7-rc3","v3.7-rc4","v3.7-rc5","v3.7-rc6","v3.7-rc7","v3.7-rc8","v3.8","v3.8-rc1","v3.8-rc2","v3.8-rc3","v3.8-rc4","v3.8-rc5","v3.8-rc6","v3.8-rc7","v3.9","v3.9-rc1","v3.9-rc2","v3.9-rc3","v3.9-rc4","v3.9-rc5","v3.9-rc6","v3.9-rc7","v3.9-rc8","v4.0","v4.0-rc1","v4.0-rc2","v4.0-rc3","v4.0-rc4","v4.0-rc5","v4.0-rc6","v4.0-rc7","v4.1","v4.1-rc1","v4.1-rc2","v4.1-rc3","v4.1-rc4","v4.1-rc5","v4.1-rc6","v4.1-rc7","v4.1-rc8","v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.2","v4.2-rc1","v4.2-rc2","v4.2-rc3","v4.2-rc4","v4.2-rc5","v4.2-rc6","v4.2-rc7","v4.2-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.3","v4.3-rc1","v4.3-rc2","v4.3-rc3","v4.3-rc4","v4.3-rc5","v4.3-rc6","v4.3-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc1","v4.4-rc2","v4.

Fix oops in xe_gem_fault when running core_hotunplug test.","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Fix oops in xe_gem_fault when running core_hotunplug test.\n\nI saw an oops in xe_gem_fault when running the xe-fast-feedback\ntestlist against the realtime kernel without debug options enabled.\n\nThe panic happens after core_hotunplug unbind-rebind finishes.\nPresumably what happens is that a process mmaps, unlocks because\nof the FAULT_FLAG_RETRY_NOWAIT logic, has no process memory left,\ncausing ttm_bo_vm_dummy_page() to return VM_FAULT_NOPAGE, since\nthere was nothing left to populate, and then oopses in\n\"mem_type_is_vram(tbo->resource->mem_type)\" because tbo->resource\nis NULL.\n\nIt's convoluted, but fits the data and explains the oops after\nthe test

Don't leak robust_list pointer on exec race","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfutex: Don't leak robust_list pointer on exec race\n\nsys_get_robust_list() and compat_get_robust_list() use ptrace_may_access()\nto check if the calling task is allowed to access another task's\nrobust_list pointer. This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the\ntarget process.\n\nDuring exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a\nprivileged one (e.g., setuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings\nmay change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access() before\nthis transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information\nafter the target becomes privileged.\n\nA racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which\nptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a\nprivileged state via exec().\n\nFor example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a\nsetuid-root binary. An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T\nis still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions\nbased on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec\nimmediately afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory\nmappings. Because get_robust_list() proceeds to access T->robust_list\nwithout synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space pointers from a\nnow-privileged process.\n\nThis violates the intended post-exec access restrictions and could\nexpose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger\nexploit chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized\ndisclosure of information across privilege boundaries and poses a\npotential security risk.\n\nTake a read lock on signal->exec_update_lock prior to

stmmac: Correctly handle Rx checksum offload errors","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac: Correctly handle Rx checksum offload errors\n\nThe stmmac_rx function would previously set skb->ip_summed to\nCHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY if hardware checksum offload (CoE) was enabled\nand the packet was of a known IP ethertype.\n\nHowever, this logic failed to check if the hardware had actually\nreported a checksum error. The hardware status, indicating a header or\npayload checksum failure, was being ignored at this stage. This could\ncause corrupt packets to be passed up the network stack as valid.\n\nThis patch corrects the logic by checking the `csum_none` status flag,\nwhich is set when the hardware reports a checksum error. If this flag\nis set, skb->ip_summed is now correctly set to CHECKSUM_NONE,\nensuring the kernel's network stack will perform its own validation and\nproperly handle the corrupt

Fix system hang caused by cpu-clock usage","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/core: Fix system hang caused by cpu-clock usage\n\ncpu-clock usage by the async-profiler tool can trigger a system hang,\nwhich got bisected back to the following commit by Octavia Togami:\n\n  18dbcbfabfff (\"perf: Fix the POLL_HUP delivery breakage\") causes this issue\n\nThe root cause of the hang is that cpu-clock is a special type of SW\nevent which relies on hrtimers. The __perf_event_overflow() callback\nis invoked from the hrtimer handler for cpu-clock events, and\n__perf_event_overflow() tries to call cpu_clock_event_stop()\nto stop the event, which calls htimer_cancel() to cancel the hrtimer.\n\nBut that's a recursion into the hrtimer code from a hrtimer handler,\nwhich (unsurprisingly) deadlocks.\n\nTo fix this bug, use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() instead, and set\nthe PERF_HES_STOPPED flag, which causes perf_swevent_hrtimer()\nto stop the event once it sees the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag.\n\n[ mingo: Fixed the comments and improved the changelog.

drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()).\n\nCPU1 is executing drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb() as a fence signalling\ncallback so in an interrupt context. It will deadlock when trying to\ngrab the xa_lock which is already held by CPU0.\n\nReplacing all xa_* usage by their xa_*_irq counterparts would fix\nthis issue, but Christian pointed out another issue: dma_fence_signal\ntakes fence.lock and so does dma_fence_add_callback.\n\n  dma_fence_signal() // locks f1.lock\n  -> drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()\n  -> foreach dependencies\n     -> dma_fence_add_callback() // locks f2.lock\n\nThis will deadlock if f1 and f2 share the same spinlock.\n\nTo fix both issues, the code iterating on dependencies and re-arming them\nis moved out to drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_work().\n\n[phasta: commit message

ioctl invokes the swap_inode_boot_loader function to\nswap inode<5> and inode<12>. However, inode<5> contain incorrect imode and\ndisordered extents, and i_nlink is set to 1. The extents check for inode in\nthe ext4_iget function can be bypassed bacause 5 is EXT4_BOOT_LOADER_INO.\nWhile links_count is set to 1, the extents are not initialized in\nswap_inode_boot_loader. After the ioctl command is executed successfully,\nthe extents are swapped to inode<12>, in this case, run the `cat` command\nto view inode<12>. And Bug_ON is triggered due to the incorrect extents.\n\nWhen the boot loader inode is not initialized, its imode can be one of the\nfollowing:\n1) the imode is a bad type, which is marked as bad_inode in ext4_iget and\n   set to S_IFREG.\n2) the imode is good type but not S_IFREG.\n3) the imode is S_IFREG.\n\nThe BUG_ON may be triggered by bypassing the check in cases 1 and 2.\nTherefore,

fix deadlock due to mbcache entry corruption","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix deadlock due to mbcache entry corruption\n\nWhen manipulating xattr blocks, we can deadlock infinitely looping\ninside ext4_xattr_block_set() where we constantly keep finding xattr\nblock for reuse in mbcache but we are unable to reuse it because its\nreference count is too big. This happens because cache entry for the\nxattr block is marked as reusable (e_reusable set) although its\nreference count is too big. When this inconsistency happens, this\ninconsistent state is kept indefinitely and so ext4_xattr_block_set()\nkeeps retrying indefinitely.\n\nThe inconsistent state is caused by non-atomic update of e_reusable bit.\ne_reusable is part of a bitfield and e_reusable update can race with\nupdate of e_referenced bit in the same bitfield resulting in loss of one\nof the updates. Fix the problem by using atomic bitops instead.\n\nThis bug has been around for many years, but it became *much* easier\nto hit after commit 65f8b80053a1 (\"ext4: fix race when reusing

Fix pci_device_is_present() for VFs by checking PF","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: Fix pci_device_is_present() for VFs by checking PF\n\npci_device_is_present() previously didn't work for VFs because it reads the\nVendor and Device ID, which are 0xffff for VFs, which looks like they\naren't present.  Check the PF instead.\n\nWei Gong reported that if virtio I/O is in progress when the driver is\nunbound or \"0\" is written to /sys/.../sriov_numvfs, the virtio I/O\noperation hangs, which may result in output like this:\n\n  task:bash state:D stack:    0 pid: 1773 ppid:  1241 flags:0x00004002\n  Call Trace:\n   schedule+0x4f/0xc0\n   blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait+0x69/0xa0\n   blk_mq_freeze_queue+0x1b/0x20\n   blk_cleanup_queue+0x3d/0xd0\n   virtblk_remove+0x3c/0xb0 [virtio_blk]\n   virtio_dev_remove+0x4b/0x80\n   ...\n   device_unregister+0x1b/0x60\n   unregister_virtio_device+0x18/0x30\n   virtio_pci_remove+0x41/0x80\n   pci_device_remove+0x3e/0xb0\n\nThis happened because pci_device_is_present(VF) returned \"false\" in\nvirtio_pci_remove(), so it called virtio_break_device().

fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: fix information leak in f2fs_move_inline_dirents()\n\nWhen converting an inline directory to a regular one, f2fs is leaking\nuninitialized memory to disk because it doesn't initialize the entire\ndirectory block.

wacom: Use ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: wacom: Use ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps\n\nCode which interacts with timestamps needs to use the ktime_t type\nreturned by functions like ktime_get. The int type does not offer\nenough space to store these values, and attempting to use it is a\nrecipe for problems.

alauda_check_media()\n\nSyzbot got KMSAN to complain about access to an uninitialized value in\nthe alauda subdriver of usb-storage:\n\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in

BIOS\nGoogle 01/01/2011\nCall Trace:\n  __dump_stack lib/dump_stack.c:77 [inline]\n  dump_stack+0x191/0x1f0 lib/dump_stack.c:113\n  kmsan_report+0x13a/0x2b0 mm/kmsan/kmsan_report.c:108\n

USB\ntransfer succeeded before trying to use the received data.  What\nshould happen if the transfer fails isn't entirely clear, but a\nreasonably conservative approach is to pretend that no media is\npresent.\n\nA similar problem exists in a usb_stor_dbg() call in\nalauda_get_media_status().  In this case, when an error occurs the\ncall is redundant, because usb_stor_ctrl_transfer() already will print\na debugging message.\n\nFinally, unrelated to the uninitialized memory access, is the fact\nthat alauda_check_media() performs DMA to a buffer on the stack.\nFortunately usb-storage provides a general purpose DMA-able buffer for\nuses like this.  We'll use it

mt7921: don't assume adequate headroom for SDIO headers","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmt76: mt7921: don't assume adequate headroom for SDIO headers\n\nmt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() calls mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() and\nmt7921_skb_add_usb_sdio_hdr(), both of which blindly assume that\nadequate headroom will be available in the passed skb. This assumption\ntypically is satisfied when the skb was allocated in the net core for\ntransmission via the mt7921 netdev (although even that is only an\noptimization and is not strictly guaranteed), but the assumption is\nsometimes not satisfied when the skb originated in the receive path of\nanother netdev and was passed through to the mt7921, such as by the\nbridge layer. Blindly prepending bytes to an skb is always wrong.\n\nThis commit introduces a call to skb_cow_head() before the call to\nmt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() in mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() to\nensure that at least MT_SDIO_TXD_SIZE + MT_SDIO_HDR_SIZE bytes can be\npushed onto the skb.\n\nWithout this fix, I can trivially cause kernel panics by bridging an\nMT7921AU-based USB 802.11ax interface with an Ethernet interface on an\nIntel Atom-based x86 system using its onboard RTL8169 PCI Ethernet\nadapter and also on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi 1 using its onboard\nSMSC9512 USB Ethernet adapter. Note that the panics do not occur in\nevery system configuration, as they occur only if the receiving netdev\nleaves less headroom in its received skbs than the mt7921 needs for its\nSDIO headers.\n\nHere is an example stack trace of this panic on Raspberry Pi OS Lite\n2023-02-21 running kernel 6.1.24+ [1]:\n\n skb_panic from skb_push+0x44/0x48\n skb_push from

The name allocated by dev_set_name() is leaked.\n2.

Fix error handling for SOCK_DGRAM in kcm_sendmsg().","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkcm: Fix error handling for SOCK_DGRAM in kcm_sendmsg().\n\nsyzkaller found a memory leak in kcm_sendmsg(), and commit c821a88bd720\n(\"kcm: Fix memory leak in error path of kcm_sendmsg()\") suppressed it by\nupdating kcm_tx_msg(head)->last_skb if partial data is copied so that the\nfollowing sendmsg() will resume from the skb.\n\nHowever, we cannot know how many bytes were copied when we get the error.\nThus, we could mess up the MSG_MORE queue.\n\nWhen kcm_sendmsg() fails for SOCK_DGRAM, we should purge the queue as we\ndo so for UDP by udp_flush_pending_frames().\n\nEven without this change, when the error occurred, the following sendmsg()\nresumed from a wrong skb and the queue was messed up.

but\nclose_sync() is not. null-ptr-deref occurs with r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio.\n\nThe following is one way to reproduce the issue.\n\n  1) create a array, wait for resync to complete, mddev->recovery_cp is set\n     to MaxSector.\n  2) recovery is woken and it is skipped. conf->have_replacement is set to\n     0 in init_resync(). close_sync() not called.\n  3) some io errors and rdev A is set to WantReplacement.\n  4) a new device is added and set to A's replacement.\n  5) recovery is woken, A have replacement, but conf->have_replacemnt is\n     0. r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio

value, and it will not\nbe changed back.\n\nMore, the original patch did not solve the problem, the value was set and\nioctl returned an error, but the subsequent io used the value in the loop\ndriver, which still caused an alarm:\n\nloop_handle_cmd\n do_req_filebacked\n  loff_t pos = ((loff_t) blk_rq_pos(rq) << 9) + lo->lo_offset;\n  lo_rw_aio\n   cmd->iocb.ki_pos =

root cause is, inodeA references inodeB via inodeB's ino, once inodeA\nis truncated, it calls truncate_dnode() to truncate data blocks in inodeB's\nnode page, it traverse mapping data from node->i.i_addr[0] to\nnode->i.i_addr[ADDRS_PER_BLOCK() - 1], result in out-of-boundary access.\n\nThis patch fixes to add sanity check on dnode page in truncate_dnode(),\nso that, it can help to avoid triggering such issue, and once it encounters\nsuch issue, it will record newly introduced ERROR_INVALID_NODE_REFERENCE\nerror into superblock, later fsck can detect such issue and try

adc: ina2xx: avoid NULL pointer dereference on OF device match","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: adc: ina2xx: avoid NULL pointer dereference on OF device match\n\nThe affected lines were resulting in a NULL pointer dereference on our\nplatform because the device tree contained the following list of\ncompatible strings:\n\n    power-sensor@40 {\n        compatible = \"ti,ina232\", \"ti,ina231\";\n        ...\n    };\n\nSince the driver doesn't declare a compatible string \"ti,ina232\", the OF\nmatching succeeds on \"ti,ina231\". But the I2C device ID info is\npopulated via the first compatible string, cf. modalias population in\nof_i2c_get_board_info(). Since there is no \"ina232\" entry in the legacy\nI2C device ID table either, the struct i2c_device_id *id pointer in the\nprobe function is NULL.\n\nFix this by using the already populated type variable instead, which\npoints to the proper driver data. Since the name is also wanted, add a\ngeneric one to the ina2xx_config table.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c43a102e67db99c8bfe6e8a9280cec13ff53b789"},{"fixed":"a8e2ae6296d56478fb98ae7f739846ed121f154f"},{"fixed":"77b689cc27d489b75d33f1a368356d70eb0ce08c"},{"fixed":"13f3ce53b65aa8b44cad7039d31e62c9ffd6c5d1"},{"fixed":"a41e19cc0d6b6a445a4133170b90271e4a2553dc"}]}],"versions":["v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc3","v4.4-rc4","v4.4-rc5","v4.4-rc6","v4.4-rc7","v4.4-rc8","v4.5","v4.5-rc1","v4.5-rc2","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6-rc6","v4.6-rc7","v4.7","v4.7-rc1","v4.7-rc2","v4.7-rc3","v4.7-rc4","v4.7-rc5","v4.7-rc6","v4.7-rc7","v4.8","v4.8-rc1","v4.8-rc2","v4.8-rc3","v4.8-rc4","v4.8-rc5","v4.8-rc6","v4.8-rc7","v4.8-rc8","v4.9","v4.9-rc1","v4.9-rc2","v4.9-rc3","v4.9-rc4","v4.9-rc5","v4.9-rc6","v4.9-rc7","v4.9-rc8","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-

However, since\nnilfs_evict_inode() uses nilfs_root for some cleanup operations, it may\ncause use-after-free read if inodes are left in \"garbage_list\" and\nreleased by nilfs_dispose_list() at the

overlay: Call of_changeset_init() early","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nof: overlay: Call of_changeset_init() early\n\nWhen of_overlay_fdt_apply() fails, the changeset may be partially\napplied, and the caller is still expected to call of_overlay_remove() to\nclean up this partial state.\n\nHowever, of_overlay_apply() calls of_resolve_phandles() before\ninit_overlay_changeset().  Hence if the overlay fails to apply due to an\nunresolved symbol, the overlay_changeset.cset.entries list is still\nuninitialized, and cleanup will crash with a NULL-pointer dereference in\noverlay_removal_is_ok().\n\nFix this by moving the call to of_changeset_init() from\ninit_overlay_changeset() to of_overlay_fdt_apply(), where all other\nearly initialization is done.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"f948d6d8b792bb90041edc12eac35faf83030994"},{"fixed":"01bb96ad38089f5cc6de7746dac13437d35eb1dc"},{"fixed":"3fb210cd521c9efcb211e9f5ce40fc907200bf13"},{"fixed":"be86241bf5d1efd16d8a7231c13b33459c5d755d"},{"fixed":"c403c81b577a67fe9ec6a2e89d143256487be50f"},{"fixed":"a9515ff4fb142b690a0d2b58782b15903b990dba"}]}],"versions":["v4.14","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.127","v5.15.128","v5.15.129","v5.15.13","v5.15.130","v5.15.131","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39",

Since 'struct\nethtool_link_ksettings' is not initialized in this path, drivers receive\nan uninitialized number of lanes in 'struct\nethtool_link_ksettings::lanes'.\n\nWhen this information is later queried from drivers, it results in the\nethtool code making decisions based on uninitialized memory, leading to\nthe following KMSAN splat [1]. In practice, this most likely only\nhappens with the tun driver that simply returns whatever it got in the\nset operation.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this uninitialized memory is not leaked to user\nspace thanks to the 'ethtool_ops->cap_link_lanes_supported' check in\nlinkmodes_prepare_data().\n\nFix by initializing the structure in the IOCTL path. Did not find any\nmore call sites that pass an uninitialized structure when calling\n'ethtool_ops::set_link_ksettings()'.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in ethnl_update_linkmodes

Move copy_seccomp() to no failure path.","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nseccomp: Move copy_seccomp() to no failure path.\n\nOur syzbot instance reported memory leaks in do_seccomp() [0], similar\nto the report [1].  It shows that we miss freeing struct seccomp_filter\nand some objects included in it.\n\nWe can reproduce the issue with the program below [2] which calls one\nseccomp() and two clone() syscalls.\n\nThe first clone()d child exits earlier than its parent and sends a\nsignal to kill it during the second clone(), more precisely before the\nfatal_signal_pending() test in copy_process().  When the parent receives\nthe signal, it has to destroy the embryonic process and return -EINTR to\nuser space.  In the failure path, we have to call seccomp_filter_release()\nto decrement the filter's refcount.\n\nInitially, we called it in free_task() called from the failure path, but\nthe commit 3a15fb6ed92c (\"seccomp: release filter after task is fully\ndead\") moved it to release_task() to notify user space as early as possible\nthat the filter is no longer used.\n\nTo keep the change and current seccomp refcount semantics, let's move\ncopy_seccomp() just after the signal check and add a WARN_ON_ONCE() in\nfree_task() for future debugging.\n\n[0]:\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880063add00 (size

release crypto keyslot before reporting I/O complete","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-mq: release crypto keyslot before reporting I/O complete\n\nOnce all I/O using a blk_crypto_key has completed, filesystems can call\nblk_crypto_evict_key().  However, the block layer currently doesn't call\nblk_crypto_put_keyslot() until the request is being freed, which happens\nafter upper layers have been told (via bio_endio()) the I/O has\ncompleted.  This causes a race condition where blk_crypto_evict_key()\ncan see 'slot_refs != 0' without there being an actual bug.\n\nThis makes __blk_crypto_evict_key() hit the\n'WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&slot->slot_refs) != 0)' and return without\ndoing anything, eventually causing a use-after-free in\nblk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys().  (This is a very rare bug and has only\nbeen seen when per-file keys are being used with fscrypt.)\n\nThere are two options to fix this: either release the keyslot before\nbio_endio() is called on the request's last bio, or make\n__blk_crypto_evict_key() ignore slot_refs.  Let's go with the first\nsolution, since it preserves the ability to report bugs (via\nWARN_ON_ONCE) where a key is evicted while still in-use.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"a892c8d52c02284076fbbacae6692aa5c5807d11"},{"fixed":"874bdf43b4a7dc5463c31508f62b3e42eb237b08"},{"fixed":"d206f79d9cd658665b37ce8134c6ec849ac7af0c"},{"fixed":"7d206ec7a04e8545828191b6ea8b49d3ea61391f"},{"fixed":"b278570e2c59d538216f8b656e97680188a8fba4"},{"fixed":"92d5d233b9ff531cf9cc36ab4251779e07adb633"},{"fixed":"9cd1e566676bbcb8a126acd921e4e194e6339603"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.10.1","v5.10.10","v5.10.100","v5.10.101","v5.10.102","v5.10.103","v5.10.104","v5.10.105","v5.10.106","v5.10.107","v5.10.108","v5.10.109","v5.10.11","v5.10.110","v5.10.111","v5.10.112","v5.10.113","v5.10.114","v5.10.115","v5.10.116","v5.10.117","v5.10.118","v5.10.119","v5.10.12","v5.10.120","v5.10.121","v5.10.122","v5.10.123","v5.10.124","v5.10.125","v5.10.126","v5.10.127","v5.10.128","v5.10.129","v5.10.13","v5.10.130","v5.10.131","v5.10.132","v5.10.133","v5.10.134","v5.10.135","v5.10.136","v5.10.137","v5.10.138","v5.10.139","v5.10.14","v5.10.140","v5.10.141","v5.10.142","v5.10.143","v5.10.144","v5.10.145","v5.10.146","v5.10.147","v5.10.148","v5.10.149","v5.10.15","v5.10.150","v5.10.151","v5.10.152","v5.10.153","v5.10.154","v5.10.155","v5.10.156","v5.10.157","v5.10.158","v5.10.159","v5.10.16","v5.10.160","v5.10.161","v5.10.162","v5.10.163","v5.10.164","v5.10.165","v5.10.166","v5.10.167","v5.10.168","v5.10.169","v5.10.17","v5.10.170","v5.10.171","v5.10.172","v5.10.173","v5.10.174","v5.10.175","v5.10.176","v5.10.177","v5.10.178","v5.10.179","v5.10.18","v5.10.19","v5.10.2","v5.10.20","v5.10.21","v5.10.22","v5.10.23","v5.10.24","v5.10.25","v5.10.26","v5.10.27","v5.10.28","v5.10.29","v5.10.3","v5.10.30","v5.10.31","v5.10.32","v5.10.33","v5.10.34","v5.10.35","v5.10.36","v5.10.37","v5.10.38","v5.10.39","v5.10.4","v5.10.40","v5.10.41","v5.10.42","v5.10.43","v5.10.44","v5.10.45","v5.10.46","v5.10.47","v5.10.48","v5.10.49","v5.10.5","v5.10.50","v5.10.51","v5.10.52","v5.10.53","v5.10.54","v5.10.55","v5.10.56","v5.10.57","v5.10.58","v5.10.59","v5.10.6","v5.10.60","v5.10.61","v5.10.62","v5.10.63","v5.10.64","v5.10.65","v5.10.66","v5.10.67","v5.10.68","v5.10.69","v5.10.7","v5.10.70","v5.10.71","v5.10.72","v5.10.73","v5.10.74","v5.10.75","v5.10.76","v5.10.77","v5.10.78","v5.10.79","v5.10.8","v5.10.80","v5.10.81","v5.10.82","v5.10.83","v5.10.84","v5.10.85","v5.10.86","v5.10.87","v5.10.88","v5.10.89","v5.10.9","v5.10.90","v5.10.91","v5.10.92","v5.10.93","v5.10.94","v5.10.95","v5.10.96","v5.10.97","v5.10.98","v5.10.99","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.7","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8

this.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0fdf10e5fc964c315cf131a2eaab9cc531a9f40f"},{"fixed":"b9396d991abe8d1ac31a043274ab20b49f92c2e6"},{"fixed":"9071525bfcb1f5674117dbed3eca0cd7b122813b"},{"fixed":"5f99014c19fa50a5719c0bb78143282632675893"},{"fixed":"a3c4c053014585dcf20f4df954791b74d8a8afcd"}]}],"versions":["v5.13","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.10","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.2.8","v6.2.9","v6.3-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53830.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.14.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.107"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.24"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53830.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f99014c19fa50a5719c0bb78143282632675893"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9071525bfcb1f5674117dbed3eca0cd7b122813b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3c4c053014585dcf20f4df954791b74d8a8afcd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9396d991abe8d1ac31a043274ab20b49f92c2e6"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53830.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53830"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53830.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-14T12:26:29.563404Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53790","published":"2025-12-09T00:00:47.025Z","modified":"2025-12-09T03:32:29.198634Z","summary":"bpf:
