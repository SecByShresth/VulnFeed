Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled\n\nDavid reported a warning observed while loop testing kexec jump:\n\n  Interrupts enabled after irqrouter_resume+0x0/0x50\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 560 at drivers/base/syscore.c:103 syscore_resume+0x18a/0x220\n   kernel_kexec+0xf6/0x180\n   __do_sys_reboot+0x206/0x250\n   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180\n\nThe corresponding interrupt flag trace:\n\n  hardirqs last  enabled at (15573): [<ffffffffa8281b8e>] __up_console_sem+0x7e/0x90\n  hardirqs last disabled at (15580): [<ffffffffa8281b73>] __up_console_sem+0x63/0x90\n\nThat means __up_console_sem() was invoked with interrupts enabled. Further\ninstrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec\njump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the\nNEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked\ncond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler:\n\n  __cond_resched+0x21/0x60\n  down_timeout+0x18/0x60\n  acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80\n  acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100\n  acpi_ns_get_node+0x27/0x60\n  acpi_ns_evaluate+0x1cb/0x2d0\n  acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data+0x156/0x190\n  acpi_pci_link_set+0x11c/0x290\n  irqrouter_resume+0x54/0x60\n  syscore_resume+0x6a/0x200\n  kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0\n  __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240\n  do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180\n\nThis is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with\nthe recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the\nscheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and\ninvokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler\nenables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above\nwarning at the end.\n\nQuite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in\ntriggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not\nhave done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations\nit's just a question of time.\n\nThe problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling\nmodels.

related to our space reservation\ncode, let's just focus on the error handling.\n\nFor example, we have the following dirty range [0, 64K) of an inode,\nwith 4K sector size and 4K page size:\n\n   0        16K        32K       48K       64K\n   |///////////////////////////////////////|\n   |#######################################|\n\nWhere |///| means page are still dirty, and |###| means the extent io\ntree has EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.\n\n- Enter extent_writepage() for page 0\n\n- Enter btrfs_run_delalloc_range() for range [0, 64K)\n\n- Enter cow_file_range() for range [0, 64K)\n\n- Function btrfs_reserve_extent() only reserved one 16K extent\n  So we created extent map and ordered extent for range [0, 16K)\n\n   0        16K        32K       48K       64K\n   |////////|//////////////////////////////|\n   |<- OE ->|##############################|\n\n   And range [0, 16K) has its delalloc flag cleared.\n   But since we haven't yet submit any bio, involved 4 pages are still\n   dirty.\n\n- Function btrfs_reserve_extent() returns with -ENOSPC\n  Now we have to run error cleanup, which will clear all\n  EXTENT_DELALLOC* flags and clear the dirty flags for the remaining\n  ranges:\n\n   0        16K        32K       48K       64K\n   |////////|                              |\n   |        |                              |\n\n  Note that range [0, 16K) still has its pages dirty.\n\n- Some time later, writeback is triggered again for the range [0, 16K)\n  since the page range still has dirty flags.\n\n- btrfs_run_delalloc_range() will do nothing because there is no\n  EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.\n\n- extent_writepage_io() finds page 0 has no ordered flag\n  Which falls into the COW fixup path, triggering the BUG_ON().\n\nUnfortunately this error handling bug dates back to the introduction of\nbtrfs.  Thankfully with the abuse of COW fixup, at least it won't crash\nthe kernel.\n\n[FIX]\nInstead of immediately unlocking the extent and folios, we keep the extent\nand folios locked until either

Use RCU in blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() instead of set->tag_list_lock","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: Use RCU in blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() instead of set->tag_list_lock\n\nblk_mq_{add,del}_queue_tag_set() functions add and remove queues from\ntagset, the functions make sure that tagset and queues are marked as\nshared when two or more queues are attached to the same tagset.\nInitially a tagset starts as unshared and when the number of added\nqueues reaches two, blk_mq_add_queue_tag_set() marks it as shared along\nwith all the queues attached to it. When the number of attached queues\ndrops to 1 blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() need to mark both the tagset and\nthe remaining queues as unshared.\n\nBoth functions need to freeze current queues in tagset before setting on\nunsetting BLK_MQ_F_TAG_QUEUE_SHARED flag. While doing so, both functions\nhold set->tag_list_lock mutex, which makes sense as we do not want\nqueues to be added or deleted in the process. This used to work fine\nuntil commit 98d81f0df70c (\"nvme: use blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset\")\nmade the nvme driver quiesce tagset instead of quiscing individual\nqueues. blk_mq_quiesce_tagset() does the job and quiesce the queues in\nset->tag_list while holding set->tag_list_lock also.\n\nThis results in deadlock between two threads with these stacktraces:\n\n  __schedule+0x47c/0xbb0\n  ? timerqueue_add+0x66/0xb0\n  schedule+0x1c/0xa0\n  schedule_preempt_disabled+0xa/0x10\n  __mutex_lock.constprop.0+0x271/0x600\n  blk_mq_quiesce_tagset+0x25/0xc0\n  nvme_dev_disable+0x9c/0x250\n  nvme_timeout+0x1fc/0x520\n  blk_mq_handle_expired+0x5c/0x90\n  bt_iter+0x7e/0x90\n  blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter+0x27e/0x550\n  ? __blk_mq_complete_request_remote+0x10/0x10\n  ? __blk_mq_complete_request_remote+0x10/0x10\n  ? __call_rcu_common.constprop.0+0x1c0/0x210\n  blk_mq_timeout_work+0x12d/0x170\n  process_one_work+0x12e/0x2d0\n  worker_thread+0x288/0x3a0\n  ? rescuer_thread+0x480/0x480\n  kthread+0xb8/0xe0\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n\n  __schedule+0x47c/0xbb0\n  ? xas_find+0x161/0x1a0\n  schedule+0x1c/0xa0\n  blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait+0x3d/0x70\n  ? destroy_sched_domains_rcu+0x30/0x30\n  blk_mq_update_tag_set_shared+0x44/0x80\n  blk_mq_exit_queue+0x141/0x150\n  del_gendisk+0x25a/0x2d0\n  nvme_ns_remove+0xc9/0x170\n  nvme_remove_namespaces+0xc7/0x100\n  nvme_remove+0x62/0x150\n  pci_device_remove+0x23/0x60\n  device_release_driver_internal+0x159/0x200\n  unbind_store+0x99/0xa0\n  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x112/0x1e0\n  vfs_write+0x2b1/0x3d0\n  ksys_write+0x4e/0xb0\n  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x160\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nThe top stacktrace is showing nvme_timeout() called to handle nvme\ncommand timeout. timeout handler is trying to disable the controller and\nas a first step, it needs to blk_mq_quiesce_tagset() to tell blk-mq not\nto call queue callback handlers. The thread is stuck waiting for\nset->tag_list_lock as it tries to walk the queues in set->tag_list.\n\nThe lock is held by the second thread in the bottom stack which is\nwaiting for one of queues to be frozen. The queue usage counter will\ndrop to zero after nvme_timeout() finishes, and this will not happen\nbecause the thread will wait for this mutex forever.\n\nGiven that [un]quiescing queue is an operation that does not need to\nsleep, update blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() to use RCU instead of taking\nset->tag_list_lock, update blk_mq_{add,del}_queue_tag_set() to use RCU\nsafe list operations. Also, delete INIT_LIST_HEAD(&q->tag_set_list)\nin blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() because we can not re-initialize it while\nthe list is being traversed under RCU.

it.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"723de0f9171eeb49a3ae98cae82ebbbb992b3a7c"},{"fixed":"6059a66dba7f26b21852831432e17075f1a1c783"},{"fixed":"e463548fd80e779efea1cb2d3049b8a7231e6925"},{"fixed":"495df2da6944477d282d5cc0c13174d06e25b310"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.5","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.11","v6.17.12","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68755.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.6.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68755.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/495df2da6944477d282d5cc0c13174d06e25b310"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6059a66dba7f26b21852831432e17075f1a1c783"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e463548fd80e779efea1cb2d3049b8a7231e6925"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68755.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68755"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68755.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-08T01:11:26.203096Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68762","published":"2026-01-05T09:32:34.743Z","modified":"2026-01-06T03:22:00.720494Z","summary":"net:

led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbacklight: led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs\n\nLED Backlight is a consumer of one or multiple LED class devices, but\ndevlink is currently unable to create correct supplier-producer links when\nthe supplier is a class device. It creates instead a link where the\nsupplier is the parent of the expected device.\n\nOne consequence is that removal order is not correctly enforced.\n\nIssues happen for example with the following sections in a device tree\noverlay:\n\n    // An LED driver chip\n    pca9632@62 {\n        compatible = \"nxp,pca9632\";\n        reg = <0x62>;\n\n\t// ...\n\n        addon_led_pwm: led-pwm@3 {\n            reg = <3>;\n            label = \"addon:led:pwm\";\n        };\n    };\n\n    backlight-addon {\n        compatible = \"led-backlight\";\n        leds = <&addon_led_pwm>;\n        brightness-levels = <255>;\n        default-brightness-level = <255>;\n    };\n\nIn this example, the devlink should be created between the backlight-addon\n(consumer) and the pca9632@62 (supplier). Instead it is created between the\nbacklight-addon (consumer) and the parent of the pca9632@62, which is\ntypically the I2C bus adapter.\n\nOn removal of the above overlay, the LED driver can be removed before the\nbacklight device, resulting in:\n\n    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010\n    ...\n    Call trace:\n     led_put+0xe0/0x140\n     devm_led_release+0x6c/0x98\n\nAnother way to reproduce the bug without any device tree overlays is\nunbinding the LED class device (pca9632@62) before unbinding the consumer\n(backlight-addon):\n\n

Fix potential out-of-bounds read in iommu_mmio_show","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/amd: Fix potential out-of-bounds read in iommu_mmio_show\n\nIn iommu_mmio_write(), it validates the user-provided offset with the\ncheck: `iommu->dbg_mmio_offset > iommu->mmio_phys_end - 4`.\nThis assumes a 4-byte access. However, the corresponding\nshow handler, iommu_mmio_show(), uses readq() to perform an 8-byte\n(64-bit) read.\n\nIf a user provides an offset equal to `mmio_phys_end - 4`, the check\npasses, and will lead to a 4-byte out-of-bounds read.\n\nFix this by adjusting the boundary check to use sizeof(u64), which\ncorresponds to the size of the readq() operation.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"7a4ee419e8c144b747a8915856e91a034d7c8f34"},{"fixed":"b959df804c33913dbfdb90750f2d693502b3d126"},{"fixed":"0ec4aaf5f3f559716a6559f3d6d9616e9470bed6"},{"fixed":"a0c7005333f9a968abb058b1d77bbcd7fb7fd1e7"}]}],"versions":["v6.16","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.11","v6.17.12","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68760.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68760.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0ec4aaf5f3f559716a6559f3d6d9616e9470bed6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a0c7005333f9a968abb058b1d77bbcd7fb7fd1e7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b959df804c33913dbfdb90750f2d693502b3d126"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68760.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68760"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68760.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-08T01:11:26.203652Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68753","published":"2026-01-05T09:32:27.029Z","modified":"2026-01-06T03:05:25.051093Z","summary":"ALSA:

usb-audio: Fix out of bounds reads when finding clock sources","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix out of bounds reads when finding clock sources\n\nThe current USB-audio driver code doesn't check bLength of each\ndescriptor at traversing for clock descriptors.  That is, when a\ndevice provides a bogus descriptor with a shorter bLength, the driver\nmight hit out-of-bounds reads.\n\nFor addressing it, this patch adds sanity checks to the validator\nfunctions for the clock descriptor traversal.  When the descriptor\nlength is shorter than expected, it's skipped in the loop.\n\nFor the clock source and clock multiplier descriptors, we can just\ncheck bLength against the sizeof() of each descriptor type.\nOTOH, the clock selector descriptor of UAC2 and UAC3 has an array\nof bNrInPins elements and two more fields at its tail, hence those\nhave to be checked in addition to the sizeof()

false-positive kmsan report is detected when running ping command.\n\nAn inline assembly instruction 'vstl' can write varied amount of bytes\ndepending on value of 'index' argument. If 'index' > 0, 'vstl' writes\nat least 2 bytes.\n\nclang generates kmsan write helper call depending on inline assembly\nconstraints. Constraints are evaluated compile-time, but value of\n'index' argument is known only at runtime.\n\nclang currently generates call to __msan_instrument_asm_store with 1 byte\nas size. Manually call kmsan function to indicate correct amount of bytes\nwritten and fix false-positive report.\n\nThis change fixes following kmsan reports:\n\n[   36.563119]

sanity check symbolic link size","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSquashfs: sanity check symbolic link size\n\nSyzkiller reports a \"KMSAN: uninit-value in pick_link\" bug.\n\nThis is caused by an uninitialised page, which is ultimately caused\nby a corrupted symbolic link size read from disk.\n\nThe reason why the corrupted symlink size causes an uninitialised\npage is due to the following sequence of events:\n\n1. squashfs_read_inode() is called to read the symbolic\n   link from disk.  This assigns the corrupted value\n   3875536935 to inode->i_size.\n\n2. Later squashfs_symlink_read_folio() is called, which assigns\n   this corrupted value to the length variable, which being a\n   signed int, overflows producing a negative number.\n\n3. The following loop that fills in the page contents checks that\n   the copied bytes is less than length, which being negative means\n   the loop is skipped, producing an uninitialised page.\n\nThis patch adds a sanity check which checks that the symbolic\nlink size is not larger than expected.\n\n--\n\nV2: fix spelling

tcp: ipv4, fix incorrect labeling","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmack: tcp: ipv4, fix incorrect labeling\n\nCurrently, Smack mirrors the label of incoming tcp/ipv4 connections:\nwhen a label 'foo' connects to a label 'bar' with tcp/ipv4,\n'foo' always gets 'foo' in returned ipv4 packets. So,\n1) returned packets are incorrectly labeled ('foo' instead of 'bar')\n2) 'bar' can write to 'foo' without being authorized to write.\n\nHere is a scenario how to see this:\n\n* Take two machines, let's call them C and S,\n   with active Smack in the default state\n   (no settings, no rules, no labeled hosts, only builtin labels)\n\n* At S, add Smack rule 'foo bar w'\n   (labels 'foo' and 'bar' are instantiated at S at this moment)\n\n* At S, at label 'bar', launch a program\n   that listens for incoming tcp/ipv4 connections\n\n* From C, at label 'foo', connect to the listener at S.\n   (label 'foo' is instantiated at C at this moment)\n   Connection succeedes and works.\n\n* Send some data in both directions.\n* Collect network traffic of this connection.\n\nAll packets in both directions are labeled with the CIPSO\nof the label 'foo'. Hence, label 'bar' writes to 'foo' without\nbeing authorized, and even without ever being known at C.\n\nIf anybody cares: exactly the same happens with DCCP.\n\nThis behavior 1st manifested in release 2.6.29.4 (see Fixes below)\nand it looks unintentional. At least, no explanation was provided.\n\nI changed returned packes label into the 'bar',\nto bring it into line with the Smack documentation

fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix i_data_sem unlock order in ext4_ind_migrate()\n\nFuzzing reports a possible deadlock in jbd2_log_wait_commit.\n\nThis issue is triggered when an EXT4_IOC_MIGRATE ioctl is set to require\nsynchronous updates because the file descriptor is opened with O_SYNC.\nThis can lead to the jbd2_journal_stop() function calling\njbd2_might_wait_for_commit(), potentially causing a deadlock if the\nEXT4_IOC_MIGRATE call races with a write(2) system call.\n\nThis problem only arises when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled. In this\ncase, the jbd2_might_wait_for_commit macro locks jbd2_handle in the\njbd2_journal_stop function while i_data_sem is locked. This triggers\nlockdep because the jbd2_journal_start function might also lock the same\njbd2_handle simultaneously.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with syzkaller.\n\nRule:

brcmfmac: Fix oops due to NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: Fix oops due to NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw()\n\nThis patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference bug in brcmfmac that occurs\nwhen a high 'sd_sgentry_align' value applies (e.g. 512) and a lot of queued SKBs\nare sent from the pkt queue.\n\nThe problem is the number of entries in the pre-allocated sgtable, it is\nnents = max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) + max(rxglom_size, txglom_size) >> 4 + 1.\nGiven the default [rt]xglom_size=32 it's actually 35 which is too small.\nWorst case, the pkt queue can end up with 64 SKBs. This occurs when a new SKB\nis added for each original SKB if tailroom isn't enough to hold tail_pad.\nAt least one sg entry is needed for each SKB. So, eventually the \"skb_queue_walk loop\"\nin brcmf_sdiod_sglist_rw may run out of sg entries.

btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks()\n\nThe unhandled case in btrfs_relocate_sys_chunks() loop is a corruption,\nas it could be caused only by two impossible conditions:\n\n- at first the search key is set up to look for a chunk tree item, with\n  offset -1, this is an inexact search and the key->offset will contain\n  the correct offset upon a successful search, a valid chunk tree item\n  cannot have an

relax assertions on failure to encode file handles","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: relax assertions on failure to encode file handles\n\nEncoding file handles is usually performed by a filesystem >encode_fh()\nmethod that may fail for various reasons.\n\nThe legacy users of exportfs_encode_fh(), namely, nfsd and\nname_to_handle_at(2) syscall are ready to cope with the possibility\nof failure to encode a file handle.\n\nThere are a few other users of exportfs_encode_{fh,fid}() that\ncurrently have a WARN_ON() assertion when ->encode_fh() fails.\nRelax those assertions because they are wrong.\n\nThe second linked bug report states commit 16aac5ad1fa9 (\"ovl: support\nencoding non-decodable file handles\") in v6.6 as the regressing commit,\nbut this is not accurate.\n\nThe aforementioned commit only increases the chances of the assertion\nand allows triggering the assertion with the reproducer using overlayfs,\ninotify and drop_caches.\n\nTriggering this assertion was always possible with other filesystems and\nother reasons of ->encode_fh() failures and more particularly, it was\nalso possible with the exact same

stop playing stack games in profile_pc()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86: stop playing stack games in profile_pc()\n\nThe 'profile_pc()' function is used for timer-based profiling, which\nisn't really all that relevant any more to begin with, but it also ends\nup making assumptions based on the stack layout that aren't necessarily\nvalid.\n\nBasically, the code tries to account the time spent in spinlocks to the\ncaller rather than the spinlock, and while I support that as a concept,\nit's not worth the code complexity or the KASAN warnings when no serious\nprofiling is done using timers anyway these days.\n\nAnd the code really does depend on stack layout that is only true in the\nsimplest of cases.  We've lost the comment at some point (I think when\nthe 32-bit and 64-bit code was unified), but it used to say:\n\n\tAssume the lock function has either no stack frame or a copy\n\tof eflags from PUSHF.\n\nwhich explains why it just blindly loads a word or two straight off the\nstack pointer and then takes a minimal look at the values to just check\nif they might be eflags or the return pc:\n\n\tEflags always has bits 22 and up cleared unlike kernel addresses\n\nbut that basic stack layout assumption assumes that there isn't any lock\ndebugging etc going on that would complicate the code and cause a stack\nframe.\n\nIt causes KASAN unhappiness reported for years by syzkaller [1] and\nothers [2].\n\nWith no real practical reason for this any more, just remove the code.\n\nJust for historical interest, here's some background commits relating to\nthis code from 2006:\n\n  0cb91a229364 (\"i386: Account spinlocks to the caller during profiling for !FP kernels\")\n  31679f38d886 (\"Simplify profile_pc on x86-64\")\n\nand a code unification from 2009:\n\n  ef4512882dbe (\"x86: time_32/64.c unify profile_pc\")\n\nbut the basics of this thing actually goes back to before the git

Implement a limit on UMAD receive List","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nIB/core: Implement a limit on UMAD receive List\n\nThe existing behavior of ib_umad, which maintains received MAD\npackets in an unbounded list, poses a risk of uncontrolled growth.\nAs user-space applications extract packets from this list, the rate\nof extraction may not match the rate of incoming packets, leading\nto potential list overflow.\n\nTo address this, we introduce a limit to the size of the list. After\nconsidering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which can\nhandle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retry\ntimeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets\nreceived beyond this limit are dropped, assuming they are likely timed\nout by the time they are handled by user-space.\n\nNotably, packets queued on the receive list due to reasons

fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled\n\nWhen a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the\ntracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled\n(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent\nbuffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths\nthat call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding\nthe last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()\ndrops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls\nfree_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent\nbuffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,\nthe current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nand the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()\nis called, resulting in a use-after-free.\n\nFix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to\nbtrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer

it can potentially\nsend two rpc_task to nfs server.\n\n                   NFS CLIENT\nthread1                             thread2\nopen(\"file\")\n...\nnfs4_do_open\n _nfs4_do_open\n  _nfs4_open_and_get_state\n   _nfs4_proc_open\n    nfs4_run_open_task\n     /* rpc_task1 */\n     rpc_run_task\n     rpc_wait_for_completion_task\n\n                                    umount -f\n                                    nfs_umount_begin\n                                     rpc_killall_tasks\n                                      rpc_signal_task\n     rpc_task1 been wakeup\n     and

first attempt to find or\nallocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not\nmarked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since\ntwo rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the\nclient to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run\nconcurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.\nAdditionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be\ntriggered.\n\n                    NFS SERVER\nnfsd1                  nfsd2       echo 0 >

entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f\n\n[CAUSE]\nThe allocation failure happens at the start_transaction() inside\nprepare_to_relocate(), and during the error handling we call\nunset_reloc_control(), which makes fs_info->balance_ctl to be NULL.\n\nThen we continue the error path cleanup in btrfs_balance() by calling\nreset_balance_state() which will call del_balance_item() to fully delete\nthe balance item in the root tree.\n\nHowever during the small window between set_reloc_contrl() and\nunset_reloc_control(), we can have a subvolume tree update and created a\nreloc_root for that subvolume.\n\nThen we go into the final btrfs_commit_transaction() of\ndel_balance_item(), and into btrfs_update_reloc_root() inside\ncommit_fs_roots().\n\nThat function checks if fs_info->reloc_ctl is in the merge_reloc_tree\nstage, but since fs_info->reloc_ctl is NULL, it results a NULL pointer\ndereference.\n\n[FIX]\nJust add extra check on fs_info->reloc_ctl inside\nbtrfs_update_reloc_root(), before checking\nfs_info->reloc_ctl->merge_reloc_tree.\n\nThat DEAD_RELOC_TREE handling is to prevent further modification to the\nreloc tree during merge stage, but

Fix buffer overflow during tab-complete","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkdb: Fix buffer overflow during tab-complete\n\nCurrently, when the user attempts symbol completion with the Tab key, kdb\nwill use strncpy() to insert the completed symbol into the command buffer.\nUnfortunately it passes the size of the source buffer rather than the\ndestination to strncpy() with predictably horrible results. Most obviously\nif the command buffer is already full but cp, the cursor position, is in\nthe middle of the buffer, then we will write past the end of the supplied\nbuffer.\n\nFix this by replacing the dubious strncpy() calls with memmove()/memcpy()\ncalls plus explicit boundary checks to make sure we have enough space\nbefore we start moving characters

flush delalloc workers queue before stopping cleaner kthread during unmount","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: flush delalloc workers queue before stopping cleaner kthread during unmount\n\nDuring the unmount path, at close_ctree(), we first stop the cleaner\nkthread, using kthread_stop() which frees the associated task_struct, and\nthen stop and destroy all the work queues. However after we stopped the\ncleaner we may still have a worker from the delalloc_workers queue running\ninode.c:submit_compressed_extents(), which calls btrfs_add_delayed_iput(),\nwhich in turn tries to wake up the cleaner kthread - which was already\ndestroyed before, resulting in a use-after-free on the task_struct.\n\nSyzbot reported this with the following stack traces:\n\n  BUG: KASAN:

add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: add missing check for inode numbers on directory entries\n\nSyzbot reported that mounting and unmounting a specific pattern of\ncorrupted nilfs2 filesystem images causes a use-after-free of metadata\nfile inodes, which triggers a kernel bug in lru_add_fn().\n\nAs Jan Kara pointed out, this is because the link count of a metadata file\ngets corrupted to 0, and nilfs_evict_inode(), which is called from iput(),\ntries to delete that inode (ifile inode in this case).\n\nThe inconsistency occurs because directories containing the inode numbers\nof these metadata files that should not be visible in the namespace are\nread without checking.\n\nFix this issue by treating the inode numbers of these internal files as\nerrors in the sanity check helper when reading directory folios/pages.\n\nAlso thanks to Hillf Danton and Matthew Wilcox for their initial

ntb_hw_switchtec: Fix use after free vulnerability in switchtec_ntb_remove due to race condition\n\nIn the switchtec_ntb_add function, it can call switchtec_ntb_init_sndev\nfunction, then &sndev->check_link_status_work is bound with\ncheck_link_status_work. switchtec_ntb_link_notification may be called\nto start the work.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call switchtec_ntb_remove to make\ncleanup, it will free sndev through kfree(sndev), while the work\nmentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead\nto a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                 CPU1\n\n                        | check_link_status_work\nswitchtec_ntb_remove

0000000000000000 ]---\n\n[CAUSE]\nThe first two lines of extra debug messages show the problem is caused\nby the error handling of run_delalloc_nocow().\n\nE.g. we have the following dirtied range (4K blocksize 4K page size):\n\n    0                 16K                  32K\n    |//////////////////////////////////////|\n    |  Pre-allocated  |\n\nAnd the range [0, 16K) has a preallocated extent.\n\n- Enter run_delalloc_nocow() for range [0, 16K)\n  Which found range [0, 16K) is preallocated, can do the proper NOCOW\n  write.\n\n- Enter fallback_to_fow() for range [16K, 32K)\n  Since the range [16K, 32K) is not backed by preallocated extent, we\n  have to go COW.\n\n- cow_file_range() failed for range [16K, 32K)\n  So cow_file_range() will do the clean up by clearing folio

start page writeback.\n  But folios can only be marked writeback when it's properly locked,\n  thus this triggered the VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO().\n\nFurthermore there is another hidden but common bug that\nrun_delalloc_nocow() is not clearing the folio dirty flags in its error\nhandling path.\nThis is the common bug shared between run_delalloc_nocow() and\ncow_file_range().\n\n[FIX]\n- Clear folio dirty for range [@start, @cur_offset)\n  Introduce a helper, cleanup_dirty_folios(), which\n  will find and lock the folio in the range, clear the dirty flag and\n  start/end the writeback, with the extra handling for the\n  @locked_folio.\n\n- Introduce a helper to clear folio dirty, start and end writeback\n\n- Introduce a helper to record the last failed COW range end\n  This is to trace which range we should skip, to avoid double\n  unlocking.\n\n- Skip the failed COW range for the

fix inode number range checks","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix inode number range checks\n\nPatch series \"nilfs2: fix potential issues related to reserved inodes\".\n\nThis series fixes one use-after-free issue reported by syzbot, caused by\nnilfs2's internal inode being exposed in the namespace on a corrupted\nfilesystem, and a couple of flaws that cause problems if the starting\nnumber of non-reserved inodes written in the on-disk super block is\nintentionally (or corruptly) changed from its default value.  \n\n\nThis patch (of 3):\n\nIn the current implementation of nilfs2, \"nilfs->ns_first_ino\", which\ngives the first non-reserved inode number, is read from the superblock,\nbut its lower limit is not checked.\n\nAs a result, if a number that overlaps with the inode number range of\nreserved inodes such as the root directory or metadata files is set in the\nsuper block parameter, the inode number test macros (NILFS_MDT_INODE and\nNILFS_VALID_INODE) will not function properly.\n\nIn addition, these test macros use left bit-shift calculations using with\nthe inode number as the shift count via the BIT macro, but the result of a\nshift calculation that exceeds the bit width of an integer is undefined in\nthe C specification, so if \"ns_first_ino\" is set to a large value other\nthan the default value NILFS_USER_INO (=11), the macros may potentially\nmalfunction depending on the environment.\n\nFix these issues by checking the lower bound of \"nilfs->ns_first_ino\" and\nby preventing bit

Fix use-after-free bug in gb_interface_release due to race condition.","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngreybus: Fix use-after-free bug in gb_interface_release due to race condition.\n\nIn gb_interface_create, &intf->mode_switch_completion is bound with\ngb_interface_mode_switch_work. Then it will be started by\ngb_interface_request_mode_switch. Here is the relevant code.\nif (!queue_work(system_long_wq, &intf->mode_switch_work)) {\n\t...\n}\n\nIf we call gb_interface_release to make cleanup, there may be an\nunfinished work. This function will call kfree to free the object\n\"intf\". However, if gb_interface_mode_switch_work is scheduled to\nrun after kfree, it may cause use-after-free error as\ngb_interface_mode_switch_work will use the object \"intf\".\nThe possible execution flow that may lead to the issue is as follows:\n\nCPU0                            CPU1\n\n                            |   gb_interface_create\n                            |

uinput - reject requests with unreasonable number of slots","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: uinput - reject requests with unreasonable number of slots\n\n\nWhen exercising uinput interface syzkaller may try setting up device\nwith a really large number of slots, which causes memory allocation\nfailure in input_mt_init_slots(). While this allocation failure is\nhandled properly and request is rejected, it results in syzkaller\nreports. Additionally, such request may put undue burden on the\nsystem which will try to free a lot of memory for a bogus request.\n\nFix it by limiting allowed number of slots to 100. This can easily\nbe extended if we see devices that can track more than 100

paths\n\nIf open_cached_dir() encounters an error parsing the lease from the\nserver, the error handling may race with receiving a lease break,\nresulting in open_cached_dir() freeing the cfid while the queued work is\npending.\n\nUpdate open_cached_dir() to drop refs rather than directly freeing the\ncfid.\n\nHave cached_dir_lease_break(), cfids_laundromat_worker(), and\ninvalidate_all_cached_dirs() clear has_lease immediately while still\nholding cfids->cfid_list_lock, and then use this to also simplify the\nreference counting in cfids_laundromat_worker() and\ninvalidate_all_cached_dirs().\n\nFixes this KASAN splat (which manually injects an error and lease break\nin

Handle allocation failures gracefully","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/ioapic: Handle allocation failures gracefully\n\nBreno observed panics when using failslab under certain conditions during\nruntime:\n\n   can not alloc irq_pin_list (-1,0,20)\n   Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC: failed to add irq-pin. Can not proceed\n\n   panic+0x4e9/0x590\n   mp_irqdomain_alloc+0x9ab/0xa80\n   irq_domain_alloc_irqs_locked+0x25d/0x8d0\n   __irq_domain_alloc_irqs+0x80/0x110\n   mp_map_pin_to_irq+0x645/0x890\n   acpi_register_gsi_ioapic+0xe6/0x150\n   hpet_open+0x313/0x480\n\nThat's a pointless panic which is a leftover of the historic IO/APIC code\nwhich panic'ed during early boot when the interrupt allocation failed.\n\nThe only place which might justify panic is the PIT/HPET timer_check() code\nwhich tries to figure out whether the timer interrupt is delivered through\nthe IO/APIC. But that code does not require to handle interrupt allocation\nfailures. If the interrupt cannot be allocated then timer delivery fails\nand it either panics due to that or falls back to legacy mode.\n\nCure this by removing the panic wrapper around __add_pin_to_irq_node() and\nmaking mp_irqdomain_alloc() aware of the failure condition and handle it as\nany other failure in this function gracefully.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"49c7e60022912d10da88ba67e8eb2927f1143f6a"},{"fixed":"e479cb835feeb2abff97f25766e23b96a6eabe28"},{"fixed":"ec862cd843faa6f0e84a7a07362f2786446bf697"},{"fixed":"077e1b7cd521163ded545987bbbd389519aeed71"},{"fixed":"649a5c2ffae797ce792023a70e84c7fe4b6fb8e0"},{"fixed":"f17efbeb2922327ea01a9efa8829fea9a30e547d"},{"fixed":"830802a0fea8fb39d3dc9fb7d6b5581e1343eb1f"}]}],"versions":["v4.1","v4.1-rc1","v4.1-rc2","v4.1-rc3","v4.1-rc4","v4.1-rc5","v4.1-rc6","v4.1-rc7","v4.1-rc8","v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.2","v4.2-rc1","v4.2-rc2","v4.2-rc3","v4.2-rc4","v4.2-rc5","v4.2-rc6","v4.2-rc7","v4.2-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.3","v4.3-rc1","v4.3-rc2","v4.3-rc3","v4.3-rc4","v4.3-rc5","v4.3-rc6","v4.3-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc1","v4.4-rc2","v4.4-rc3","v4.4-rc4","v4.4-rc5","v4.4-rc6","v4.4-rc7","v4.4-rc8","v4.5","v4.5-rc1","v4.5-rc2","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6-rc6","v4.6-rc7","v4.7","v4.7-rc1","v4.7-rc2","v4.7-rc3","v4.7-rc4","v4.7-rc5","v4.7-rc6","v4.7-rc7","v4.8","v4.8-rc1","v4.8-rc2","v4.8-rc3","v4.8-rc4","v4.8-rc5","v4.8-rc6","v4.8-rc7","v4.8-rc8","v4.9","v4.9-rc1","v4.9-rc2","v4.9-rc3","v4.9-rc4","v4.9-rc5","v4.9-rc6","v4.9-rc7","v4.9-rc8","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.127","v5.15.128","v5.15.129","v5.15.13","v5.15.130","v5.15.131","v5.15.132","v5.15.133","v5.15.134","v5.15.135","v5.15.136","v5.15.137","v5.15.138","v5.15.139","v5.15.14","v5.15.140","v5.15.141","v5.15.142","v5.15.143","v5.15.144","v5.15.145","v5.15.146","v5.15.147","v5.15.148","v5.15.149","v5.15.15","v5.15.150","v5.15.151","v5.15.152","v5.15.153","v5.15.154","v5.15.155","v5.15.156","v5.15.157","v5.15.158","v5.15.159","v5.15.16","v5.15.160","v5.15.161","v5.15.162","v5.15.163","v5.15.164","v5.15.165","v5.15.166","v5.15.167","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.9

This\nhelps with stack trace de-duplication, avoiding an explosion of saved\nstack traces that share the same IRQ context code path but originate\nfrom different randomly interrupted points, eventually exhausting the\nstack depot.\n\nFiltering uses in_irqentry_text() to identify functions within the\n.irqentry.text and .softirqentry.text sections, which then become the\nlast stack trace entries being saved.\n\nWhile __do_softirq() is placed into the .softirqentry.text section by\ncommon code, populating .irqentry.text is architecture-specific.\n\nCurrently, the .irqentry.text section on s390 is empty, which prevents\nstack depot filtering and de-duplication and could result in warnings\nlike:\n\nStack depot reached limit capacity\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 286113 at lib/stackdepot.c:252 depot_alloc_stack+0x39a/0x3c8\n\nwith PREEMPT and KASAN enabled.\n\nFix this by moving the IO/EXT interrupt handlers from .kprobes.text into\nthe .irqentry.text section and updating the kprobes blacklist to include\nthe .irqentry.text section.\n\nThis is done only for asynchronous interrupts and explicitly not for\nprogram checks, which are synchronous and where the context beyond the\nprogram check is important to preserve. Despite machine checks being\nsomewhat in between, they are extremely rare, and preserving context\nwhen possible is also of value.\n\nSVCs and Restart Interrupts are not relevant, one being always at the\nboundary to user space and the other being a one-time thing.\n\nIRQ entries filtering is also optionally used in ftrace function graph,\nwhere the same logic applies.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e940066089490efde86abc519593be84362f4e53"},{"fixed":"5bb7a2c3afcf8732dc65ea49c09147b07da1d993"},{"fixed":"1af22528fee8072b7adc007b8ca49cc4ea62689e"},{"fixed":"473ffae3030188f1c6b80e1b3631a26b4adf7b32"},{"fixed":"45c9f2b856a075a34873d00788d2e8a250c1effd"}]}],"versions":["v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.2","v6.12.3","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.11","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.7","v6.6.8","v6.6.9","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57838.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.120"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.64"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.4"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2024-57838.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1af22528fee8072b7adc007b8ca49cc4ea62689e"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/45c9f2b856a075a34873d00788d2e8a250c1effd"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/473ffae3030188f1c6b80e1b3631a26b4adf7b32"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5bb7a2c3afcf8732dc65ea49c09147b07da1d993"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2024/57xxx/CVE-2024-57838.json"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/03/msg00001.html"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-57838

It added one to uart_shutdown(), so\nthe commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that\nprotection, there is an unprotected \"uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);\"\ncall. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the\nreason why we do not see lots of these reports.\n\nOr it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.\n\nUntil the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move this\ndereference to the if too.\n\nI got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130.
