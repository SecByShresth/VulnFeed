[{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68325","published":"2025-12-18T15:02:50.214Z","modified":"2025-12-18T22:45:14.794547Z","summary":"net/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop\n\nIn cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen\nand backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes\nthat the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this\nassumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent\nqdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog\naccounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference\n(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).\n\nThis patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by\nobserving the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()\ncalls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()\nreturns NET_XMIT_CN.\n\nTo ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new\nvariable is introduced to keep qlen

imm: Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: imm: Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work\n\nThe delayed work item 'imm_tq' is initialized in imm_attach() and\nscheduled via imm_queuecommand() for processing SCSI commands.  When the\nIMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),\nthe imm_struct device instance is deallocated.\n\nHowever, the delayed work might still be pending or executing\nwhen imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs\nwhen the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already\nfreed imm_struct memory.\n\nThe race condition can occur as follows:\n\nCPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1\n                       | imm_queuecommand()\n                       |   imm_queuecommand_lck()\nimm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()\n  kfree(dev) //FREE

imon: make send_packet() more robust","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: imon: make send_packet() more robust\n\nsyzbot is reporting that imon has three problems which result in\nhung tasks due to forever holding device lock [1].\n\nFirst problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\nafter ictx->dev_present_intf0 became true, usb_rx_callback_intf0()\nresubmits urb after printk(), and resubmitted urb causes\nusb_rx_callback_intf0() to again get -EPROTO error. This results in\nprintk() flooding (RCU stalls).\n\nAlan Stern commented [2] that\n\n  In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust\n  error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the\n  number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed, perhaps with a\n  time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to\n  do this; they simply give up right away.  This makes them more\n  vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers, but in\n  reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong\n  with giving up right away.\n\nbut imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever;\nthis behavior should be fixed.\n\nSince I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any\nerror code, this patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from\nmodules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.\nir_toy, mceusb and igorplugusb).\n\nSecond problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\nbefore ictx->dev_present_intf0 becomes true, usb_rx_callback_intf0() always\nresubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf (\"[media] imon: don't wedge\nhardware after early callbacks\"). Move the ictx->dev_present_intf0 test\nintroduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a (\"[media] imon: don't parse scancodes\nuntil intf configured\") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet(), or\nthe first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.\nhung task).\n\nThird problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some\nreason (e.g. flaky hardware; the reproducer for this problem sometimes\nprevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called),\nwait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.\nhung task). As a workaround for such situation, change send_packet() to\nwait for completion with timeout of 10

route: Prevent rt_bind_exception() from rebinding stale fnhe","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv4: route: Prevent rt_bind_exception() from rebinding stale fnhe\n\nThe sit driver's packet transmission path calls: sit_tunnel_xmit() ->\nupdate_or_create_fnhe(), which lead to fnhe_remove_oldest() being called\nto delete entries exceeding FNHE_RECLAIM_DEPTH+random.\n\nThe race window is between fnhe_remove_oldest() selecting fnheX for\ndeletion and the subsequent kfree_rcu(). During this time, the\nconcurrent path's __mkroute_output() -> find_exception() can fetch the\nsoon-to-be-deleted fnheX, and rt_bind_exception() then binds it with a\nnew dst using a dst_hold(). When the original fnheX is freed via RCU,\nthe dst reference remains permanently leaked.\n\nCPU 0                             CPU 1\n__mkroute_output()\n  find_exception() [fnheX]\n                                  update_or_create_fnhe()\n                                    fnhe_remove_oldest() [fnheX]\n  rt_bind_exception() [bind dst]\n                                  RCU callback [fnheX freed, dst leak]\n\nThis issue manifests as a device reference count leak and a warning in\ndmesg when unregistering the net device:\n\n  unregister_netdevice: waiting for sitX to become free. Usage count = N\n\nIdo Schimmel provided the simple test validation method [1].\n\nThe fix clears 'oldest->fnhe_daddr' before calling fnhe_flush_routes().\nSince rt_bind_exception() checks this field, setting it to zero prevents\nthe stale fnhe from being reused and bound to a new dst just before it\nis freed.\n\n[1]\nip netns add ns1\nip -n ns1 link set dev lo up\nip -n ns1 address add

netpoll: fix incorrect refcount handling causing incorrect cleanup","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: netpoll: fix incorrect refcount handling causing incorrect cleanup\n\ncommit efa95b01da18 (\"netpoll: fix use after free\") incorrectly\nignored the refcount and prematurely set dev->npinfo to NULL during\nnetpoll cleanup, leading to improper behavior and memory leaks.\n\nScenario causing lack of proper cleanup:\n\n1) A netpoll is associated with a NIC (e.g., eth0) and netdev->npinfo is\n   allocated, and refcnt = 1\n   - Keep in mind that npinfo is shared among all netpoll instances. In\n     this case, there is just one.\n\n2) Another netpoll is also associated with the same NIC and\n   npinfo->refcnt += 1.\n   - Now dev->npinfo->refcnt = 2;\n   - There is just one npinfo associated to the netdev.\n\n3) When the first netpolls goes to clean up:\n   - The first cleanup succeeds and clears np->dev->npinfo, ignoring\n     refcnt.\n     - It basically calls `RCU_INIT_POINTER(np->dev->npinfo, NULL);`\n   - Set dev->npinfo = NULL, without proper cleanup\n   - No ->ndo_netpoll_cleanup() is either called\n\n4) Now the second target tries to clean up\n   - The second cleanup fails because np->dev->npinfo is already NULL.\n     * In this case, ops->ndo_netpoll_cleanup() was never called, and\n       the skb pool is not cleaned as well (for the second netpoll\n       instance)\n  - This leaks npinfo and skbpool skbs, which is clearly reported by\n    kmemleak.\n\nRevert commit efa95b01da18 (\"netpoll: fix use after free\") and adds\nclarifying comments emphasizing that npinfo cleanup should only happen\nonce the refcount reaches zero, ensuring stable and correct

Prevents free active kevent","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: Prevents free active kevent\n\nThe root cause of this issue are:\n1. When probing the usbnet device, executing usbnet_link_change(dev, 0, 0);\nput the kevent work in global workqueue. However, the kevent has not yet\nbeen scheduled when the usbnet device is unregistered. Therefore, executing\nfree_netdev() results in the \"free active object (kevent)\" error reported\nhere.\n\n2. Another factor is that when calling usbnet_disconnect()->unregister_netdev(),\nif the usbnet device is up, ndo_stop() is executed to cancel the kevent.\nHowever, because the device is not up, ndo_stop() is not executed.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to cancel the kevent before

check whether the SCSI\nhost tag set has already been initialized. tag_set->ops is set by\nscsi_mq_setup_tags() just before blk_mq_alloc_tag_set() is called.

calling cpufreq_cpu_get(0) without checking\nfor a NULL policy pointer. On some systems, this could lead to a\nNULL dereference and a kernel warning or panic.\n\nThis patch adds a check using unlikely() and returns early if the\npolicy is NULL.\n\nBugzilla:

->d_parent->d_inode dereferencing\n\nTheoretically it's an oopsable race, but I don't believe one can manage\nto hit it on real hardware; might become doable on a KVM, but it still\nwon't be easy to attack.\n\nAnyway, it's easy to deal with - since xdr_encode_hyper() is just a call of\nput_unaligned_be64(), we can put that under ->d_lock and be done with

Fix softlockup in ftrace_module_enable","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nftrace: Fix softlockup in ftrace_module_enable\n\nA soft lockup was observed when loading amdgpu module.\nIf a module has a lot of tracable functions, multiple calls\nto kallsyms_lookup can spend too much time in RCU critical\nsection and with disabled preemption, causing kernel panic.\nThis is the same issue that was fixed in\ncommit d0b24b4e91fc (\"ftrace: Prevent RCU stall on PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY\nkernels\") and commit 42ea22e754ba (\"ftrace: Add cond_resched() to\nftrace_graph_set_hash()\").\n\nFix it the same way by adding cond_resched() in

enetc: fix the deadlock of enetc_mdio_lock","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: enetc: fix the deadlock of enetc_mdio_lock\n\nAfter applying the workaround for err050089, the LS1028A platform\nexperiences RCU stalls on RT kernel. This issue is caused by the\nrecursive acquisition of the read lock enetc_mdio_lock. Here list some\nof the call stacks identified under the enetc_poll path that may lead to\na deadlock:\n\nenetc_poll\n  -> enetc_lock_mdio\n  -> enetc_clean_rx_ring OR napi_complete_done\n     -> napi_gro_receive\n        -> enetc_start_xmit\n           -> enetc_lock_mdio\n           -> enetc_map_tx_buffs\n           -> enetc_unlock_mdio\n  -> enetc_unlock_mdio\n\nAfter enetc_poll acquires the read lock, a higher-priority writer attempts\nto acquire the lock, causing preemption. The writer detects that a\nread lock is already held and is scheduled out. However, readers under\nenetc_poll cannot acquire the read lock again because a writer is already\nwaiting, leading to a thread hang.\n\nCurrently, the deadlock is avoided by adjusting enetc_lock_mdio to prevent\nrecursive lock

ESR IE parsing\n\nThe Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling in OnBeacon accessed\n*(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these\noffsets lie within the received frame buffer. A malformed beacon with\nan ESR IE positioned at the end of the buffer could cause an\nout-of-bounds read, potentially triggering a kernel panic.\n\nAdd a boundary check to ensure that the ESR IE body and the subsequent\nbytes are within the limits of the frame before attempting to access\nthem.\n\nThis prevents OOB reads caused by malformed beacon

restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinfmt_misc: restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()\n\nbm_register_write() opens an executable file using open_exec(), which\ninternally calls do_open_execat() and denies write access on the file to\navoid modification while it is being executed.\n\nHowever, when an error occurs, bm_register_write() closes the file using\nfilp_close() directly. This does not restore the write permission, which\nmay cause subsequent write operations on the same file to fail.\n\nFix this by calling exe_file_allow_write_access() before filp_close() to\nrestore the write permission

An attacker can use a malicious USB descriptor\nto force the allocation of a very small buffer.\n\nSubsequently, if the device sends an interrupt packet with a specific\npattern (e.g., where the first byte is 0x80 or 0x42),\nthe pegasus_parse_packet() function parses the packet without checking\nthe allocated buffer size.

Fix proto fallback detection with BPF","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: Fix proto fallback detection with BPF\n\nThe sockmap feature allows bpf syscall from userspace, or based\non bpf sockops, replacing the sk_prot of sockets during protocol stack\nprocessing with sockmap's custom read/write interfaces.\n'''\ntcp_rcv_state_process()\n

helper\n          tcp_bpf_update_proto()  <== update sk_prot\n'''\n\nWhen the server has MPTCP enabled but the client sends a TCP SYN\nwithout MPTCP, subflow_syn_recv_sock() performs a fallback on the\nsubflow, replacing the subflow sk's sk_prot with the native sk_prot.\n'''\nsubflow_syn_recv_sock()\n  subflow_ulp_fallback()\n    subflow_drop_ctx()\n      mptcp_subflow_ops_undo_override()\n'''\n\nThen, this subflow can be normally used by sockmap, which replaces the\nnative sk_prot with sockmap's custom sk_prot. The issue occurs when the\nuser executes accept::mptcp_stream_accept::mptcp_fallback_tcp_ops().\nHere, it uses sk->sk_prot to compare with the native sk_prot, but this\nis incorrect when sockmap is used, as we may incorrectly set\nsk->sk_socket->ops.\n\nThis fix uses the more generic sk_family for the comparison instead.\n\nAdditionally, this also prevents a WARNING from occurring:\n\nresult

Fix incorrect error check in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narch_topology: Fix incorrect error check in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()\n\nFix incorrect use of PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()\nwhich causes the code to proceed with NULL clock pointers. The current\nlogic uses !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) which evaluates to true for both\nvalid pointers and NULL, leading to potential NULL pointer dereference\nin clk_get_rate().\n\nPer include/linux/err.h documentation, PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(ptr) returns:\n\"The error code within @ptr if it is an error pointer; 0 otherwise.\"\n\nThis means PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() returns 0 for both valid pointers AND NULL\npointers. Therefore !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) evaluates to true (proceed)\nwhen cpu_clk is either valid or NULL, causing clk_get_rate(NULL) to be\ncalled when of_clk_get() returns NULL.\n\nReplace with !IS_ERR_OR_NULL(cpu_clk) which only proceeds for valid\npointers, preventing potential NULL pointer dereference in

fix gpu page fault after hibernation on PF passthrough","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: fix gpu page fault after hibernation on PF passthrough\n\nOn PF passthrough environment, after hibernate and then resume, coralgemm\nwill cause gpu page fault.\n\nMode1 reset happens during hibernate, but partition mode is not restored\non resume, register mmCP_HYP_XCP_CTL and mmCP_PSP_XCP_CTL is not right\nafter resume. When CP access the MQD BO, wrong stride size is used,\nthis will cause out of bound access on the MQD BO, resulting page fault.\n\nThe fix is to ensure gfx_v9_4_3_switch_compute_partition() is called\nwhen resume from a hibernation.\nKFD resume is called separately during a reset recovery or resume from\nsuspend sequence. Hence it's not required to be called as part of\npartition switch.\n\n(cherry picked from commit

before device initialization\n\nThe early error path in hdm_probe() can jump to err_free_mdev before\n&mdev->dev has been initialized with device_initialize(). Calling\nput_device(&mdev->dev) there triggers a device core WARN and ends up\ninvoking kref_put(&kobj->kref, kobject_release) on an uninitialized\nkobject.\n\nIn this path the private struct was only kmalloc'ed and the intended\nrelease is effectively kfree(mdev) anyway, so free it directly instead\nof calling put_device() on an uninitialized device.\n\nThis removes the WARNING and fixes the

atlantic: fix fragment overflow handling in RX path","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: atlantic: fix fragment overflow handling in RX path\n\nThe atlantic driver can receive packets with more than MAX_SKB_FRAGS (17)\nfragments when handling large multi-descriptor packets. This causes an\nout-of-bounds write in skb_add_rx_frag_netmem() leading to kernel panic.\n\nThe issue occurs because the driver doesn't check the total number of\nfragments before calling skb_add_rx_frag(). When a packet requires more\nthan MAX_SKB_FRAGS fragments, the fragment index exceeds the array bounds.\n\nFix by assuming there will be an extra frag if buff->len > AQ_CFG_RX_HDR_SIZE,\nthen all fragments are accounted for. And reusing the existing check to\nprevent the overflow earlier in the code path.\n\nThis crash occurred in production with an Aquantia AQC113 10G NIC.\n\nStack trace from production

fix multifs mds auth caps issue","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: fix multifs mds auth caps issue\n\nThe mds auth caps check should also validate the\nfsname along with the associated caps. Not doing\nso would result in applying the mds auth caps of\none fs on to the other fs in a multifs ceph cluster.\nThe bug causes multiple issues w.r.t user\nauthentication, following is one such example.\n\nSteps to Reproduce (on vstart cluster):\n1. Create two file systems in a cluster, say 'fsname1' and 'fsname2'\n2. Authorize read only permission to the user 'client.usr' on fs 'fsname1'\n    $ceph fs authorize fsname1 client.usr / r\n3. Authorize read and write permission to the same user 'client.usr' on fs 'fsname2'\n    $ceph fs authorize fsname2 client.usr / rw\n4. Update the keyring\n    $ceph auth get client.usr >> ./keyring\n\nWith above permssions for the user 'client.usr', following is the\nexpectation.\n  a. The 'client.usr' should be able to only read the contents\n     and not allowed to create or delete files on file system 'fsname1'.\n  b. The 'client.usr' should be able to read/write on file system 'fsname2'.\n\nBut, with this bug, the 'client.usr' is allowed to read/write on file\nsystem 'fsname1'. See below.\n\n5. Mount the file system 'fsname1' with the user 'client.usr'\n     $sudo bin/mount.ceph usr@.fsname1=/ /kmnt_fsname1_usr/\n6. Try creating a file on file system 'fsname1' with user 'client.usr'. This\n   should fail but passes with this bug.\n     $touch /kmnt_fsname1_usr/file1\n7. Mount the file system 'fsname1' with the user 'client.admin' and create a\n   file.\n     $sudo bin/mount.ceph admin@.fsname1=/ /kmnt_fsname1_admin\n     $echo \"data\" > /kmnt_fsname1_admin/admin_file1\n8. Try removing an existing file on file system 'fsname1' with the user\n   'client.usr'. This shoudn't succeed but succeeds with the bug.\n     $rm -f /kmnt_fsname1_usr/admin_file1\n\nFor more information, please take a look at the corresponding mds/fuse patch\nand tests added by looking

As reported in the Closes tag URL, the WARN indicates that\na deadlock can happen due to the dependency among disk->open_mutex,\nkblockd workqueue completion and partition_scan_work completion.\n\nTo avoid the lockdep WARN and the potential deadlock, cut the dependency\nby running the partition_scan_work not by kblockd workqueue but

avoid infinite loops due to corrupted subpage compact indexes","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: avoid infinite loops due to corrupted subpage compact indexes\n\nRobert reported an infinite loop observed by two crafted images.\n\nThe root cause is that `clusterofs` can be larger than `lclustersize`\nfor !NONHEAD `lclusters` in corrupted subpage compact indexes, e.g.:\n\n  blocksize = lclustersize = 512   lcn = 6   clusterofs = 515\n\nMove the corresponding check for full compress indexes to\n`z_erofs_load_lcluster_from_disk()` to also cover subpage compact\ncompress indexes.\n\nIt also fixes the position of `m->type >= Z_EROFS_LCLUSTER_TYPE_MAX`\ncheck, since it should be placed right

storage: Fix memory leak in USB bulk transport","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: storage: Fix memory leak in USB bulk transport\n\nA kernel memory leak was identified by the 'ioctl_sg01' test from Linux\nTest Project (LTP). The following bytes were mainly observed: 0x53425355.\n\nWhen USB storage devices incorrectly skip the data phase with status data,\nthe code extracts/validates the CSW from the sg buffer, but fails to clear\nit afterwards. This leaves status protocol data in srb's transfer buffer,\nsuch as the US_BULK_CS_SIGN 'USBS' signature observed here. Thus, this can\nlead to USB protocols leaks to user space through SCSI generic (/dev/sg*)\ninterfaces, such as the one seen here when the LTP test requested 512 KiB.\n\nFix the leak by zeroing the CSW data in srb's transfer buffer immediately\nafter the validation of devices that skip data phase.\n\nNote: Differently from CVE-2018-1000204, which fixed a big leak by zero-\ning pages at allocation time, this leak occurs after allocation, when USB\nprotocol data is written to already-allocated sg

delete radeon_fence_process in is_signaled, no deadlock","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/radeon: delete radeon_fence_process in is_signaled, no deadlock\n\nDelete the attempt to progress the queue when checking if fence is\nsignaled. This avoids deadlock.\n\ndma-fence_ops::signaled can be called with the fence lock in unknown\nstate. For radeon, the fence lock is also the wait queue lock. This can\ncause a self deadlock when signaled() tries to make forward progress on\nthe wait queue. But advancing the queue is unneeded because incorrectly\nreturning false from signaled() is perfectly acceptable.\n\n(cherry picked from commit

dwc3: Fix race condition between concurrent dwc3_remove_requests() call paths","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: Fix race condition between concurrent dwc3_remove_requests() call paths\n\nThis patch addresses a race condition caused by unsynchronized\nexecution of multiple call paths invoking `dwc3_remove_requests()`,\nleading to premature freeing of USB requests and subsequent crashes.\n\nThree distinct execution paths interact with `dwc3_remove_requests()`:\nPath 1:\nTriggered via `dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt()` during USB reset\nhandling. The call stack includes:\n- `dwc3_ep0_reset_state()`\n- `dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart()`\n- `dwc3_ep0_out_start()`\n- `dwc3_remove_requests()`\n- `dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()`\n\nPath 2:\nAlso initiated from `dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt()`, but through\n`dwc3_stop_active_transfers()`. The call stack includes:\n- `dwc3_stop_active_transfers()`\n- `dwc3_remove_requests()`\n- `dwc3_gadget_del_and_unmap_request()`\n\nPath 3:\nOccurs independently during `adb root` execution, which triggers\nUSB function unbind and bind operations. The sequence includes:\n- `gserial_disconnect()`\n- `usb_ep_disable()`\n- `dwc3_gadget_ep_disable()`\n- `dwc3_remove_requests()` with `-ESHUTDOWN` status\n\nPath 3 operates asynchronously and lacks synchronization with Paths\n1 and 2. When Path 3 completes, it disables endpoints and frees 'out'\nrequests.

\"req.len\" variables are u64 values that come from the\nuser at the start of the function.  We mask away the high 32 bits of\n\"req.len\" so that's capped at U32_MAX but the \"req.start\" variable can go\nup to U64_MAX which means that the addition can still integer overflow.\n\nUse

more robust handing of race to avoid txq getting stuck","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nveth: more robust handing of race to avoid txq getting stuck\n\nCommit dc82a33297fc (\"veth: apply qdisc backpressure on full ptr_ring to\nreduce TX drops\") introduced a race condition that can lead to a permanently\nstalled TXQ. This was observed in production on ARM64 systems (Ampere Altra\nMax).\n\nThe race occurs in veth_xmit(). The producer observes a full ptr_ring and\nstops the queue (netif_tx_stop_queue()). The subsequent conditional logic,\nintended to re-wake the queue if the consumer had just emptied it (if\n(__ptr_ring_empty(...)) netif_tx_wake_queue()), can fail. This leads to a\n\"lost wakeup\" where the TXQ remains stopped (QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF) and\ntraffic halts.\n\nThis failure is caused by an incorrect use of the __ptr_ring_empty() API\nfrom the producer side. As noted in kernel comments, this check is not\nguaranteed to be correct if a consumer is operating on another CPU. The\nempty test is based on ptr_ring->consumer_head, making it reliable only for\nthe consumer. Using this check from the producer side is fundamentally racy.\n\nThis patch fixes the race by adopting the more robust logic from an earlier\nversion V4 of the patchset, which always flushed the peer:\n\n(1) In veth_xmit(), the racy conditional wake-up logic and its memory barrier\nare removed. Instead, after stopping the queue, we unconditionally call\n__veth_xdp_flush(rq). This guarantees that the NAPI consumer is scheduled,\nmaking it solely responsible for re-waking the TXQ.\n  This handles the race where veth_poll() consumes all packets and completes\nNAPI *before* veth_xmit() on the producer side has called netif_tx_stop_queue.\nThe __veth_xdp_flush(rq) will observe rx_notify_masked is false and schedule\nNAPI.\n\n(2) On the consumer side, the logic for waking the peer TXQ is moved out of\nveth_xdp_rcv() and placed at the end of the veth_poll() function. This\nplacement is part of fixing the race, as the netif_tx_queue_stopped() check\nmust occur after rx_notify_masked is potentially set to false during NAPI\ncompletion.\n  This handles the race where veth_poll() consumes all packets, but haven't\nfinished (rx_notify_masked is still true).

However, following commit 060913999d7a (\"mm: migrate:\nsupport poisoned recover from migrate folio\"), folio_mc_copy() is called\nbefore __folio_migrate_mapping().

.owner_cpu: 0\n\nWhile creating the stack trace, the unwinder uses the stack pointer to guess\nthe previous frame to read the previous stack pointer from memory.  The crash\nhappens, because the unwinder tries to read from unaligned memory and as such\ntriggers the unalignment trap handler which then leads to the spinlock\nrecursion and finally to a deadlock.\n\nFix it by checking the alignment before accessing the

ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix UFS OCP issue during UFS power down (PC=3)","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix UFS OCP issue during UFS power down (PC=3)\n\nAccording to UFS specifications, the power-off sequence for a UFS device\nincludes:\n\n - Sending an SSU command with Power_Condition=3 and await a response.\n\n - Asserting RST_N low.\n\n - Turning off REF_CLK.\n\n - Turning off VCC.\n\n - Turning off VCCQ/VCCQ2.\n\nAs part of ufs shutdown, after the SSU command completion, asserting\nhardware reset (HWRST) triggers the device firmware to wake up and\nexecute its reset routine. This routine initializes hardware blocks and\ntakes a few milliseconds to complete. During this time, the ICCQ draws a\nlarge current.\n\nThis large ICCQ current may cause issues for the regulator which is\nsupplying power to UFS, because the turn off request from UFS driver to\nthe regulator framework will be immediately followed by low power\nmode(LPM) request by regulator framework. This is done by framework\nbecause UFS which is the only client is requesting for disable. So if\nthe rail is still in the process of shutting down while ICCQ exceeds LPM\ncurrent thresholds, and LPM mode is activated in hardware during this\nstate, it may trigger an overcurrent protection (OCP) fault in the\nregulator.\n\nTo prevent this, a 10ms delay is added after asserting HWRST. This\nallows the reset operation to complete while power rails remain active\nand in high-power mode.\n\nCurrently there is no way for Host to query whether the reset is\ncompleted or not and hence this the delay is based on experiments with\nQualcomm UFS controllers across multiple UFS

Ensure XFD state on signal delivery","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Ensure XFD state on signal delivery\n\nSean reported [1] the following splat when running KVM tests:\n\n   WARNING: CPU: 232 PID: 15391 at xfd_validate_state+0x65/0x70\n   Call Trace:\n    <TASK>\n    fpu__clear_user_states+0x9c/0x100\n

scenario involving signal\ndelivery: a non-AMX task is preempted by an AMX-enabled task which\nmodifies the XFD MSR.\n\nWhen the non-AMX task resumes and reloads XSTATE with init values,\na warning is triggered due to a mismatch between fpstate::xfd and the\nCPU's current XFD state. fpu__clear_user_states() does not currently\nre-synchronize the XFD state after such preemption.\n\nInvoke

don't clear IMA_DIGSIG flag when setting or removing non-IMA xattr","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nima: don't clear IMA_DIGSIG flag when setting or removing non-IMA xattr\n\nCurrently when both IMA and EVM are in fix mode, the IMA signature will\nbe reset to IMA hash if a program first stores IMA signature in\nsecurity.ima and then writes/removes some other security xattr for the\nfile.\n\nFor example, on Fedora, after booting the kernel with \"ima_appraise=fix\nevm=fix ima_policy=appraise_tcb\" and installing rpm-plugin-ima,\ninstalling/reinstalling a package will not make good reference IMA\nsignature generated. Instead IMA hash is generated,\n\n    # getfattr -m - -d -e hex /usr/bin/bash\n    # file: usr/bin/bash\n    security.ima=0x0404...\n\nThis happens because when setting security.selinux, the IMA_DIGSIG flag\nthat had been set early was cleared. As a result, IMA hash is generated\nwhen the file is closed.\n\nSimilarly, IMA signature can be cleared on file close after removing\nsecurity xattr like security.evm or setting/removing ACL.\n\nPrevent replacing the IMA file signature with a file hash, by preventing\nthe IMA_DIGSIG flag from being reset.\n\nHere's a minimal C reproducer which sets security.selinux as the last\nstep which can also replaced by removing security.evm or setting ACL,\n\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <sys/xattr.h>\n    #include <fcntl.h>\n    #include <unistd.h>\n    #include <string.h>\n

Fix uninitialized 'offp' in statmount_string()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: Fix uninitialized 'offp' in statmount_string()\n\nIn statmount_string(), most flags assign an output offset pointer (offp)\nwhich is later updated with the string offset. However, the\nSTATMOUNT_MNT_UIDMAP and STATMOUNT_MNT_GIDMAP cases directly set the\nstruct fields instead of using offp. This leaves offp uninitialized,\nleading to a possible uninitialized dereference when *offp is updated.\n\nFix it by assigning offp for UIDMAP and GIDMAP as well, keeping the code\npath

is that queue_usage_counter is grabbed with rq_qos_mutex\nheld in blkg_conf_prep(), while queue should be freezed before\nrq_qos_mutex from other context.\n\nThe blk_queue_enter() from blkg_conf_prep() is used to protect against\npolicy deactivation, which is already protected with blkcg_mutex, hence\nconvert blk_queue_enter() to blkcg_mutex to fix this problem. Meanwhile,\nconsider that blkcg_mutex is held after queue is freezed from policy\ndeactivation, also convert blkg_alloc() to use

Fix LTP test failures when timestamps are delegated","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nNFS: Fix LTP test failures when timestamps are delegated\n\nThe utimes01 and utime06 tests fail when delegated timestamps are\nenabled, specifically in subtests that modify the atime and mtime\nfields using the 'nobody' user ID.\n\nThe problem can be reproduced as follow:\n\n# echo \"/media *(rw,no_root_squash,sync)\" >> /etc/exports\n# export -ra\n# mount -o rw,nfsvers=4.2 127.0.0.1:/media /tmpdir\n# cd /opt/ltp\n# ./runltp -d /tmpdir -s utimes01\n# ./runltp

Fix NULL function pointer race in timer_shutdown_sync()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntimers: Fix NULL function pointer race in timer_shutdown_sync()\n\nThere is a race condition between timer_shutdown_sync() and timer\nexpiration that can lead to hitting a WARN_ON in expire_timers().\n\nThe issue occurs when timer_shutdown_sync() clears the timer function\nto NULL while the timer is still running on another CPU. The race\nscenario looks like this:\n\nCPU0\t\t\t\t\tCPU1\n\t\t\t\t\t<SOFTIRQ>\n\t\t\t\t\tlock_timer_base()\n\t\t\t\t\texpire_timers()\n\t\t\t\t\tbase->running_timer = timer;\n\t\t\t\t\tunlock_timer_base()\n\t\t\t\t\t[call_timer_fn enter]\n\t\t\t\t\tmod_timer()\n\t\t\t\t\t...\ntimer_shutdown_sync()\nlock_timer_base()\n// For now, will not detach the timer but only clear its function to NULL\nif (base->running_timer != timer)\n\tret = detach_if_pending(timer, base, true);\nif (shutdown)\n\ttimer->function = NULL;\nunlock_timer_base()\n\t\t\t\t\t[call_timer_fn exit]\n\t\t\t\t\tlock_timer_base()\n\t\t\t\t\tbase->running_timer = NULL;\n\t\t\t\t\tunlock_timer_base()\n\t\t\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t\t\t// Now timer is pending while its function set to NULL.\n\t\t\t\t\t// next timer trigger\n\t\t\t\t\t<SOFTIRQ>\n\t\t\t\t\texpire_timers()\n\t\t\t\t\tWARN_ON_ONCE(!fn) // hit\n\t\t\t\t\t...\nlock_timer_base()\n// Now timer will detach\nif (base->running_timer != timer)\n\tret = detach_if_pending(timer, base, true);\nif (shutdown)\n\ttimer->function = NULL;\nunlock_timer_base()\n\nThe problem is that timer_shutdown_sync() clears the timer function\nregardless of whether the timer is currently running. This can leave a\npending timer with a NULL function pointer, which triggers the\nWARN_ON_ONCE(!fn) check in expire_timers().\n\nFix this by only clearing the timer function when actually detaching the\ntimer. If the timer is running, leave the function pointer intact, which is\nsafe because the timer will be properly detached when it finishes running.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"334c33aa487be406a149c8b87c38c8399d2dba8d"},{"fixed":"1a975716cc8977f461e45e28e3e5977d46ad7a6a"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"0cc04e80458a822300b93f82ed861a513edde194"},{"fixed":"6665fbd7730b26d770c232b20d1b907e6a67a914"},{"fixed":"176725f4848376530a0f0da9023f956afcc33585"},{"fixed":"a01efa7a780c42ac5170a949bd95c9786ffcc60a"},{"fixed":"20739af07383e6eb1ec59dcd70b72ebfa9ac362c"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.158","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.100","v6.6.101","v6.6.102","v6.6.103","v6.6.104","v6.6.105","v6.6.106","v6.6.107","v6.6.108","v6.6.109","v6.6.11","v6.6.110","v6.6.111","v6.6.112","v6.6.113","v6.6.114","v6.6.115","v6.6.116","v6.6.117","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.7","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","v6.6.76","v6.6.77","v6.6.78","v6.6.79","v6.6.8","v6.6.80","v6.6.81","v6.6.82","v6.6.83","v6.6.84","v6.6.85","v6.6.86","v6.6.87","v6.6.88","v6.6.89","v6.6.9","v6.6.90","v6.6.91","v6.6.92","v6.6.93","v6.6.94","v6.6.95","v6.6.96","v6.6.97","v6.6.98","v6.6.99","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68214.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.159"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.118"},{"fixed":"6.12.60"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68214.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/176725f4848376530a0f0da9023f956afcc33585"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a975716cc8977f461e45e28e3e5977d46ad7a6a"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.ker

RX, Fix generating skb from non-linear xdp_buff for striding RQ","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: RX, Fix generating skb from non-linear xdp_buff for striding RQ\n\nXDP programs can change the layout of an xdp_buff through\nbpf_xdp_adjust_tail() and bpf_xdp_adjust_head(). Therefore, the driver\ncannot assume the size of the linear data area nor fragments. Fix the\nbug in mlx5 by generating skb according to xdp_buff after XDP programs\nrun.\n\nCurrently, when handling multi-buf XDP, the mlx5 driver assumes the\nlayout of an xdp_buff to be unchanged. That is, the linear data area\ncontinues to be empty and fragments remain the same. This may cause\nthe driver to generate erroneous skb or triggering a kernel\nwarning. When an XDP program added linear data through\nbpf_xdp_adjust_head(), the linear data will be ignored as\nmlx5e_build_linear_skb() builds an skb without linear data and then\npull data from fragments to fill the linear data area. When an XDP\nprogram has shrunk the non-linear data through bpf_xdp_adjust_tail(),\nthe delta passed to __pskb_pull_tail() may exceed the actual nonlinear\ndata size and trigger the BUG_ON in it.\n\nTo fix the issue, first record the original number of fragments. If the\nnumber of fragments changes after the XDP program runs, rewind the end\nfragment pointer by the difference and recalculate the truesize.

refresh inline data size before write operations","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: refresh inline data size before write operations\n\nThe cached ei->i_inline_size can become stale between the initial size\ncheck and when ext4_update_inline_data()/ext4_create_inline_data() use\nit. Although ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads the correct value at the\ntime of the check, concurrent xattr operations can modify i_inline_size\nbefore ext4_write_lock_xattr() is acquired.\n\nThis causes ext4_update_inline_data() and ext4_create_inline_data() to\nwork with stale capacity values, leading to a BUG_ON() crash in\next4_write_inline_data():\n\n  kernel BUG at fs/ext4/inline.c:1331!\n  BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);\n\nThe race window:\n1. ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads i_inline_size = 60 (correct)\n2. Size check passes for 50-byte write\n3. [Another thread adds xattr, i_inline_size changes to 40]\n4. ext4_write_lock_xattr() acquires lock\n5. ext4_update_inline_data() uses stale i_inline_size = 60\n6. Attempts to write 50 bytes but only 40 bytes actually available\n7. BUG_ON() triggers\n\nFix this by recalculating i_inline_size via ext4_find_inline_data_nolock()\nimmediately after acquiring xattr_sem. This ensures ext4_update_inline_data()\nand ext4_create_inline_data() work with current values that are protected\nfrom concurrent modifications.\n\nThis is similar to commit a54c4613dac1 (\"ext4: fix race writing to an\ninline_data file while its xattrs are changing\") which fixed i_inline_off\nstaleness. This patch addresses the related i_inline_size staleness

kvaser_usb: leaf: Fix potential infinite loop in command parsers","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: kvaser_usb: leaf: Fix potential infinite loop in command parsers\n\nThe `kvaser_usb_leaf_wait_cmd()` and `kvaser_usb_leaf_read_bulk_callback`\nfunctions contain logic to zero-length commands. These commands are used\nto align data to the USB endpoint's wMaxPacketSize boundary.\n\nThe driver attempts to skip these placeholders by aligning the buffer\nposition `pos` to the next packet boundary using `round_up()` function.\n\nHowever, if zero-length command is found exactly on a packet boundary\n(i.e., `pos` is a multiple of wMaxPacketSize, including 0), `round_up`\nfunction will return the unchanged value of `pos`. This prevents `pos`\nto be increased, causing an infinite loop in the parsing logic.\n\nThis patch fixes this in the function by using `pos + 1` instead.\nThis ensures that even if `pos` is on a boundary, the calculation is\nbased on `pos + 1`, forcing `round_up()` to always return the next\naligned

indicate success when effectively deflating during migration","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvmw_balloon: indicate success when effectively deflating during migration\n\nWhen migrating a balloon page, we first deflate the old page to then\ninflate the new page.\n\nHowever, if inflating the new page succeeded, we effectively deflated the\nold page, reducing the balloon size.\n\nIn that case, the migration actually worked: similar to migrating+\nimmediately deflating the new page.

When later trying to putback that page, we will run\ninto the WARN_ON_ONCE() in balloon_page_putback().\n\nThat handling was changed in commit 3544c4faccb8 (\"mm/balloon_compaction:\nstop using __ClearPageMovable()\"); before that change, we would have\ntolerated that way of handling it.\n\nTo fix it, let's just return 0 in that case, making the core effectively\njust clear the \"isolated\" flag + freeing it back to the buddy as if the\nmigration succeeded.  Note that the new page will also get freed when the\ncore puts the last reference.\n\nNote that this also makes it all be more consistent: we will no longer\nunisolate the page in the balloon driver while keeping it marked as being\nisolated in migration core.\n\nThis was found by code inspection.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"3544c4faccb8f0867bc65f8007ee70bfb5054305"},{"fixed":"aa05a044c5c2e147d726ac2fae1a97e0775eac11"},{"fixed":"4ba5a8a7faa647ada8eae61a36517cf369f5bbe4"}]}],"versions":["v6.16","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.18-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68248.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.6"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68248.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ba5a8a7faa647ada8eae61a36517cf369f5bbe4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aa05a044c5c2e147d726ac2fae1a97e0775eac11"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68248.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68248"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68248.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-19T18:21:13.805628Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68234","published":"2025-12-16T14:04:14.300Z","modified":"2025-12-16T20:36:38.502697Z","summary":"io_uring/cmd_net: fix wrong argument types for skb_queue_splice()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/cmd_net: fix wrong argument types for skb_queue_splice()\n\nIf timestamp retriving needs to be retried and the local list of\nSKB's already has entries, then it's spliced back into the socket\nqueue.

OnAssocReq IE parsing\n\nThe Supported Rates IE length from an incoming Association Request frame\nwas used directly as the memcpy() length when copying into a fixed-size\n16-byte stack buffer (supportRate). A malicious station can advertise an\nIE length larger than 16 bytes, causing a stack buffer overflow.\n\nClamp ie_len to the buffer size before copying the Supported Rates IE,\nand correct the bounds check when merging Extended Supported Rates to\nprevent a second potential overflow.\n\nThis prevents kernel stack corruption triggered by malformed

parser\n\nThe Information Element (IE) parser rtw_get_ie() trusted the length\nbyte of each IE without validating that the IE body (len bytes after\nthe 2-byte header) fits inside the remaining frame buffer. A malformed\nframe can advertise an IE length larger than the available data, causing\nthe parser to increment its pointer beyond the buffer end. This results\nin out-of-bounds reads or, depending on the pattern, an infinite loop.\n\nFix by validating that (offset + 2 + len) does not exceed the limit\nbefore accepting the IE or advancing to the

fix lock warning in amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: fix lock warning in amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process\n\nFix a potential deadlock caused by inconsistent spinlock usage\nbetween interrupt and process contexts in the userq fence driver.\n\nThe issue occurs when amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process() is called\nfrom both:\n- Interrupt context: gfx_v11_0_eop_irq() -> amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process()\n- Process context: amdgpu_eviction_fence_suspend_worker() ->\n  amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_force_completion() -> amdgpu_userq_fence_driver_process()\n\nIn interrupt context, the spinlock was acquired without disabling\ninterrupts, leaving it in {IN-HARDIRQ-W} state. When the same lock\nis acquired in process context, the kernel detects inconsistent\nlocking since the process context acquisition would enable interrupts\nwhile holding a lock previously acquired in interrupt context.\n\nKernel log shows:\n[ 4039.310790] inconsistent {IN-HARDIRQ-W} -> {HARDIRQ-ON-W} usage.\n[ 4039.310804] kworker/7:2/409 [HC0[0]:SC0[0]:HE1:SE1] takes:\n[ 4039.310818]

Fix deadlock in memory allocation under spinlock","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetpoll: Fix deadlock in memory allocation under spinlock\n\nFix a AA deadlock in refill_skbs() where memory allocation while holding\nskb_pool->lock can trigger a recursive lock acquisition attempt.\n\nThe deadlock scenario occurs when the system is under severe memory\npressure:\n\n1. refill_skbs() acquires skb_pool->lock (spinlock)\n2. alloc_skb() is called while holding the lock\n3. Memory allocator fails and calls slab_out_of_memory()\n4. This triggers printk() for the OOM warning\n5. The console output path calls netpoll_send_udp()\n6. netpoll_send_udp() attempts to acquire the same skb_pool->lock\n7. Deadlock: the lock is already held by the same CPU\n\nCall stack:\n  refill_skbs()\n    spin_lock_irqsave(&skb_pool->lock)    <- lock acquired\n    __alloc_skb()\n      kmem_cache_alloc_node_noprof()\n        slab_out_of_memory()\n          printk()\n            console_flush_all()\n              netpoll_send_udp()\n                skb_dequeue()\n                  spin_lock_irqsave(&skb_pool->lock)     <- deadlock attempt\n\nThis bug was exposed by commit 248f6571fd4c51 (\"netpoll: Optimize skb\nrefilling on critical path\") which removed refill_skbs() from the\ncritical path (where nested printk was being deferred), letting nested\nprintk being called from inside refill_skbs()\n\nRefactor refill_skbs() to never allocate memory while holding\nthe spinlock.\n\nAnother possible solution to fix this problem is protecting the\nrefill_skbs() from nested printks, basically calling\nprintk_deferred_{enter,exit}() in refill_skbs(), then, any nested\npr_warn() would be deferred.\n\nI prefer this approach, given I _think_ it might be a good idea to move\nthe alloc_skb() from GFP_ATOMIC to GFP_KERNEL in the future, so, having\nthe alloc_skb() outside of the lock will be necessary step.\n\nThere is a possible TOCTOU issue when checking for the pool length, and\nqueueing the new allocated skb, but, this is not an issue, given that\nan extra SKB in the pool is harmless and it will be eventually used.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"248f6571fd4c51531f7f8f07f186f7ae98a50afc"},{"fixed":"06742a3ab884d7428c9050b205ffcf6a8a548397"},{"fixed":"327c20c21d80e0d87834b392d83ae73c955ad8ff"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68169.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68169.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/06742a3ab884d7428c9050b205ffcf6a8a548397"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/327c20c21d80e0d87834b392d83ae73c955ad8ff"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68169.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68169"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68169.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-19T18:21:13.795465Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-68188","published":"2025-12-16T13:43:10.680Z","modified":"2025-12-16T20:34:26.376761Z","summary":"tcp:
