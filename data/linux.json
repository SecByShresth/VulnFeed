Enable\na sensible limit on the number of encoder chips (4 chips max, each\nwith 2 channels) to stop this behaviour from manifesting.\n\n[1] Syzbot crash:\nINFO: task syz.2.19:6067 blocked for more

Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()\n\nIf track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple\ntree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over\nthe dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied\nany page tables.\n\nConsequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the\nPAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page\ntable was not copied.\n\nThe easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA\nif track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about \"simply\"\nclearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()\nand performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll\nsimply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...\nwhich is also wrong.\n\nSo let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation\nsucceeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if\nanything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT\nflag after undoing the reservation.\n\nNote that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will\nget removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set\nthen, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be\nhappy. Note that leaving these page tables in place without a reservation\nis not a problem, as we are aborting fork(); this process will never run.\n\nA reproducer can trigger this usually at the first

peer's transmit MCS is sent to\nfirmware as receive MCS while peer's receive MCS sent as transmit MCS,\nwhich goes against firmwire's definition.\n\nWhile connecting to a misbehaved AP that advertises 0xffff (meaning not\nsupported) for 160 MHz transmit MCS map, firmware crashes due to 0xffff\nis assigned to he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field.\n\n\tExt Tag: HE Capabilities\n\t    [...]\n\t    Supported

is meant to limit our own transmit MCS, it\nneeds to go via he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field.

Was it\ncaused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk\nwas working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to\nstarve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs\nshared one x1 slot by means of a commercial \"PCIe splitter\" board.\n\n[ 7.162604] usb 10-2: reset SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd\n[ 7.178990] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 UNKNOWN(0x2003) Result: hostbyte=0x07 driverbyte=DRIVER_OK cmd_age=0s\n[ 7.179001] sd 9:0:0:0: [sdb] tag#0 CDB: opcode=0x28 28 00 04 02 ae 00 00 02 00 00\n[ 7.179004] I/O error, dev sdb, sector 67284480 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 5 prio class 0\n\nFortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting\nthe chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are\nknown which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if\nit's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.\n\nThe bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports\ntens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds.

Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nima: Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()\n\nIn ima_match_rules(), if ima_filter_rule_match() returns -ENOENT due to\nthe rule being NULL, the function incorrectly skips the 'if (!rc)' check\nand sets 'result = true'. The LSM rule is considered a match, causing\nextra files to be measured by IMA.\n\nThis issue can be reproduced in the following scenario:\nAfter unloading the SELinux policy module via 'semodule -d', if an IMA\nmeasurement is triggered before ima_lsm_rules is updated,\nin ima_match_rules(), the first call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns\n-ESTALE. This causes the code to enter the 'if (rc == -ESTALE &&\n!rule_reinitialized)' block, perform ima_lsm_copy_rule() and retry. In\nima_lsm_copy_rule(), since the SELinux module has been removed, the rule\nbecomes NULL, and the second call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns\n-ENOENT. This bypasses the 'if (!rc)' check and results in a false match.\n\nCall trace:\n  selinux_audit_rule_match+0x310/0x3b8\n  security_audit_rule_match+0x60/0xa0\n  ima_match_rules+0x2e4/0x4a0\n

do not bypass the check and accidentally result in a\nsuccessful

Fix invalid prog->stats access when update_effective_progs fails","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix invalid prog->stats access when update_effective_progs fails\n\nSyzkaller triggers an invalid memory access issue following fault\ninjection in update_effective_progs. The issue can be described as\nfollows:\n\n__cgroup_bpf_detach\n  update_effective_progs\n    compute_effective_progs\n      bpf_prog_array_alloc <-- fault inject\n  purge_effective_progs\n    /* change to dummy_bpf_prog */\n    array->items[index] = &dummy_bpf_prog.prog\n\n---softirq start---\n__do_softirq\n  ...\n    __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_skb\n      __bpf_prog_run_save_cb\n        bpf_prog_run\n          stats = this_cpu_ptr(prog->stats)\n          /* invalid memory access */\n          flags = u64_stats_update_begin_irqsave(&stats->syncp)\n---softirq end---\n\n  static_branch_dec(&cgroup_bpf_enabled_key[atype])\n\nThe reason is that fault injection caused update_effective_progs to fail\nand then changed the original prog into dummy_bpf_prog.prog in\npurge_effective_progs. Then a softirq came, and accessing the members of\ndummy_bpf_prog.prog in the softirq triggers invalid mem access.\n\nTo fix it, skip updating stats when stats is NULL.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"492ecee892c2a4ba6a14903d5d586ff750b7e805"},{"fixed":"93d1964773ff513c9bd530f7686d3e48b786fa6b"},{"fixed":"bf2c990b012100610c0f1ec5c4ea434da2d080c2"},{"fixed":"539137e3038ce6f953efd72110110f03c14c7d97"},{"fixed":"56905bb70c8b88421709bb4e32fcba617aa37d41"},{"fixed":"2579c356ccd35d06238b176e4b460978186d804b"},{"fixed":"7dc211c1159d991db609bdf4b0fb9033c04adcbc"}]}],"versions":["v5.0","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","

sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop\n\nIn cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen\nand backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes\nthat the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this\nassumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent\nqdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog\naccounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference\n(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).\n\nThis patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by\nobserving the difference before and

delete x->tunnel as we delete x","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x\n\nThe ipcomp fallback tunnels currently get deleted (from the various\nlists and hashtables) as the last user state that needed that fallback\nis destroyed (not deleted). If a reference to that user state still\nexists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,\ntriggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining\nreferences, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 (\"xfrm: destroy xfrm_state\nsynchronously on net exit path\") is not complete.\n\nWe recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of\nskbs (commit 9b6412e6979f (\"tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we\ncurrently drop dst\")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs\nwith a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns\ndestruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the\ntime xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)\nxfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding\nfallback state.\n\nInstead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,\nthis patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the\nfallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been\ndeleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is\ndropped.\n\nA separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since\nwe're going to lock x->tunnel while x is

c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration\n\nThe Comedi low-level driver \"c6xdigio\" seems to be for a parallel port\nconnected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi\n\"attach\" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this\ndriver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by\nregistering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the\nreturn value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and\n`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi \"detach\" handler\n`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with\n`pnp_unregister_driver()`.\n\nIt is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it\ncalls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to\n`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both\ncases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it\ndoes in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be\ncalled by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if\nthe Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for\nsome other reason.)\n\nThe unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous\nsuccessful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause\n`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning \"Unexpected driver\nunregister!\".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].\n\nAlso, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at\nmodule init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching\nComedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi\ndevice being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)\n\nChange the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,\nand the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`\nnow only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change\nthe Comedi driver \"detach\" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n[1] Syzbot sample crash report:\nUnexpected driver unregister!\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5970 at drivers/base/driver.c:273

Free special fields when update [lru_,]percpu_hash maps","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Free special fields when update [lru_,]percpu_hash

There have been many inconsistencies in the file system\ndata.\nIn the case of file system data inconsistency, for example, if the block\nbitmap of a referenced block is not set, it can lead to the situation where\na block being committed is allocated and used again. As a result, the\nfollowing condition will not be satisfied then trigger BUG_ON. Of course,\nit is entirely possible to construct a problematic image that can trigger\nthis BUG_ON through specific operations. In fact, I have constructed such\nan image and easily reproduced this issue.\nTherefore, J_ASSERT() holds true only under ideal conditions, but it may\nnot necessarily be satisfied in exceptional scenarios. Using J_ASSERT()\ndirectly in abnormal situations would cause the system to crash, which is\nclearly not what we want.

before notifying the\nwaiter\") moved nbd_config_put() to run before waking up the waiter in\nrecv_work, in order to ensure that nbd_start_device_ioctl() would not\nbe woken up while nbd->task_recv was still uncleared.\n\nHowever, in nbd_start_device_ioctl(), after being woken up it explicitly\ncalls flush_workqueue() to make sure all current works are finished.\nTherefore, there is no need to move the config put ahead of the wakeup.\n\nMove nbd_config_put() to the end of recv_work, so that the reference is\nheld for the whole lifetime of the worker thread. This makes sure the\nconfig cannot be freed while recv_work is still running, even if clear\n+ reconfigure interleave.\n\nIn addition, we don't need to worry about recv_work dropping the last\nnbd_put (which causes deadlock):\n\npath A (netlink with NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):\n  connect  // nbd_refs=1 (trigger recv_work)\n  open nbd // nbd_refs=2\n  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK\n  close nbd\n    nbd_release\n      nbd_disconnect_and_put\n        flush_workqueue // recv_work done\n      nbd_config_put\n        nbd_put // nbd_refs=1\n      nbd_put // nbd_refs=0\n        queue_work\n\npath B

refresh inline data size before write operations","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: refresh inline data size before write operations\n\nThe cached ei->i_inline_size can become stale between the initial size\ncheck and when ext4_update_inline_data()/ext4_create_inline_data() use\nit. Although ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads the correct value at the\ntime of the check, concurrent xattr operations can modify i_inline_size\nbefore ext4_write_lock_xattr() is acquired.\n\nThis causes ext4_update_inline_data() and ext4_create_inline_data() to\nwork with stale capacity values, leading to a BUG_ON() crash in\next4_write_inline_data():\n\n  kernel BUG at fs/ext4/inline.c:1331!\n  BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);\n\nThe race window:\n1. ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads i_inline_size = 60 (correct)\n2. Size check passes for 50-byte write\n3. [Another thread adds xattr, i_inline_size changes to 40]\n4. ext4_write_lock_xattr() acquires lock\n5. ext4_update_inline_data() uses stale i_inline_size = 60\n6. Attempts to write 50 bytes but only 40 bytes actually available\n7. BUG_ON() triggers\n\nFix this by recalculating i_inline_size via ext4_find_inline_data_nolock()\nimmediately after acquiring xattr_sem. This ensures ext4_update_inline_data()\nand ext4_create_inline_data() work with current values that are protected\nfrom concurrent modifications.\n\nThis is similar to commit a54c4613dac1 (\"ext4: fix race writing to an\ninline_data file while its xattrs are changing\") which fixed i_inline_off\nstaleness. This patch addresses the related i_inline_size staleness

mi_format_new\n\nFix a KMSAN un-init bug found by syzkaller.\n\nntfs_get_bh() expects a buffer from sb_getblk(), that buffer may not be\nuptodate.

smartpqi: Fix device resources accessed after device removal","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: smartpqi: Fix device resources accessed after device removal\n\nCorrect possible race conditions during device removal.\n\nPreviously, a scheduled work item to reset a LUN could still execute\nafter the device was removed, leading to use-after-free and other\nresource access issues.\n\nThis race condition occurs because the abort handler may schedule a LUN\nreset concurrently with device removal via sdev_destroy(), leading to\nuse-after-free and improper access to freed resources.\n\n  - Check in the device reset handler if the device is still present in\n    the controller's SCSI device list before running; if not, the

in\ndetect_stream_formats().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"58579c056c1c9510ae6695ed8e01ee05bbdcfb23"},{"fixed":"4a6ab0f6cc9bdfdfecbf257a46ff4275bd965af4"},{"fixed":"dea3ed2c16f99f46f97b1a090bf80ecdd6972ce0"},{"fixed":"c0a1fe1902ad23e6d48e0f68be1258ccf7a163e6"},{"fixed":"932aa1e80b022419cf9710e970739b7a8794f27c"},{"fixed":"1e1b3207a53e50d5a66289fffc1f7d52cd9c50f9"},{"fixed":"324f3e03e8a85931ce0880654e3c3eb38b0f0bba"}]}],"versions":["v4.17","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v

released.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"99c457d902cf90bdc0df5d57e6156ec108711068"},{"fixed":"594ff8bb69e239678a8baa461827ce4bb90eff8f"},{"fixed":"1c3c234af9407256ed670c8752923a672eea4225"},{"fixed":"278bfed4529a0c9c9119f5a52ddafe69db61a75c"},{"fixed":"fb905e69941b44e03fe1a24e95328d45442b6d6d"},{"fixed":"4d42aba0ee49c0aa015c50c4f2a07cf8fa1c3a49"},{"fixed":"53d1548612670aa8b5d89745116cc33d9d172863"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.6","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17

ipc: fix use-after-free in ipc_msg_send_request","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: ipc: fix use-after-free in ipc_msg_send_request\n\nipc_msg_send_request() waits for a generic netlink reply using an\nipc_msg_table_entry on the stack. The generic netlink handler\n(handle_generic_event()/handle_response()) fills entry->response under\nipc_msg_table_lock, but ipc_msg_send_request() used to validate and free\nentry->response without holding the same lock.\n\nUnder high concurrency this allows a race where handle_response() is\ncopying data into entry->response while ipc_msg_send_request() has just\nfreed it, leading to a slab-use-after-free reported by KASAN in\nhandle_generic_event():\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in handle_generic_event+0x3c4/0x5f0 [ksmbd]\n  Write of size 12 at addr ffff888198ee6e20 by task

ipc_msg_send_request() while validating\n  entry->response, freeing it when invalid, and removing the entry from\n  ipc_msg_table.\n- Returning the final entry->response pointer to the caller only

requested.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"634ec0b2906efd46f6f57977e172aa3470aca432"},{"fixed":"16620f0617400746984362c3d6ac547eeae1d35f"},{"fixed":"ddd32ec66bc4eb6969fe835e4cc1c0706c6348fe"},{"fixed":"6275fd726d53a8ec724f20201cf3bd862711e17b"},{"fixed":"161291bac551821bba98eb4ea84c82338578d1b0"},{"fixed":"cdda0d06f8650e33255f79839f188bbece44117c"},{"fixed":"210d77cca3d0494ed30a5c628b20c1d95fa04fb1"}]}],"versions":["v5.15","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.60","v6.12.61","v6.12.62","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.11","v6.17.12","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.100","v6.6.101","v6.6.102","v6.6.103","v6.6.104","v6.6.105","v6.6.106","v6.6.107",

pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()\n\nSyzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from\nthe fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),\nsubdevice dev->read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to\n&struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of\n&s->async->cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.\n\nMitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from\npcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its\nsupport for async commands, everything async-related will be\nhandled via subdevice's own ->cancel() function in\ncomedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no\nsupport for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need\nto cancel anything either.\n\n[1] Syzbot crash:\nOops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address

state: fix out-of-bounds read during lookup","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: state: fix out-of-bounds read during lookup\n\nlookup and resize can run in parallel.\n\nThe xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry, but the hash\nfunctions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist\narray.\n\nrehash does:\n  rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst, ndst) [..]\n  net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask;\n\nWhile state lookup does:\n  h = xfrm_dst_hash(net, daddr, saddr, tmpl->reqid, encap_family);\n  hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x, net->xfrm.state_bydst + h, bydst) {\n\nThis is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than\nnet->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets\nserialized via state spinlock again).\n\nFix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers.\nThe xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer\nand the hmask will be consistent.\n\nThe existing helpers, like xfrm_dst_hash(), are now unsafe for RCU side,\nadd lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for

SVM: Don't skip unrelated instruction if INT3/INTO is replaced","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: SVM: Don't skip unrelated instruction if INT3/INTO is replaced\n\nWhen re-injecting a soft interrupt from an INT3, INT0, or (select) INTn\ninstruction, discard the exception and retry the instruction if the code\nstream is changed (e.g. by a different vCPU) between when the CPU\nexecutes the instruction and when KVM decodes the instruction to get the\nnext RIP.\n\nAs effectively predicted by commit 6ef88d6e36c2 (\"KVM: SVM: Re-inject\nINT3/INTO instead of retrying the instruction\"), failure to verify that\nthe correct INTn instruction was decoded can effectively clobber guest\nstate due to decoding the wrong instruction and thus specifying the\nwrong next RIP.\n\nThe bug most often manifests as \"Oops: int3\" panics on static branch\nchecks in Linux guests.  Enabling or disabling a static branch in Linux\nuses the kernel's \"text poke\" code patching mechanism.  To modify code\nwhile other CPUs may be executing that code, Linux (temporarily)\nreplaces the first byte of the original instruction with an int3 (opcode\n0xcc), then patches in the new code stream except for the first byte,\nand finally replaces the int3 with the first byte of the new code\nstream.  If a CPU hits the int3, i.e. executes the code while it's being\nmodified, then the guest kernel must look up the RIP to determine how to\nhandle the #BP, e.g. by emulating the new instruction.  If the RIP is\nincorrect, then this lookup fails and the guest kernel panics.\n\nThe bug reproduces almost instantly by hacking the guest kernel to\nrepeatedly check a static branch[1] while running a drgn script[2] on\nthe host to constantly swap out the memory containing the guest's TSS.\n\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/osandov/44d17c51c28c0ac998ea0334edf90b5a\n[2]:

page.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6666cebc5e306f49a25bd20aa8c1cb8ef8950df5"},{"fixed":"b52153da1f42e2f4d6259257a7ba027331671a93"},{"fixed":"4584486cfcca24b7b586da3377eb3cffd48669ec"},{"fixed":"031e00249e9e6bee72ba66701c8f83b45fc4b8a2"},{"fixed":"59b97641de03c081f26b3a8876628c765b5faa25"},{"fixed":"5f2b28b79d2d1946ee36ad8b3dc0066f73c90481"}]}],"versions":["v5.1","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc

led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbacklight: led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs\n\nLED Backlight is a consumer of one or multiple LED class devices, but\ndevlink is currently unable to create correct supplier-producer links when\nthe supplier is a class device. It creates instead a link where the\nsupplier is the parent of the expected device.\n\nOne consequence is that removal order is not correctly enforced.\n\nIssues happen for example with the following sections in a device tree\noverlay:\n\n    // An LED driver chip\n    pca9632@62 {\n        compatible = \"nxp,pca9632\";\n        reg = <0x62>;\n\n\t// ...\n\n        addon_led_pwm: led-pwm@3 {\n            reg = <3>;\n            label = \"addon:led:pwm\";\n        };\n    };\n\n    backlight-addon {\n        compatible = \"led-backlight\";\n        leds = <&addon_led_pwm>;\n        brightness-levels = <255>;\n        default-brightness-level = <255>;\n    };\n\nIn this example, the devlink should be created between the backlight-addon\n(consumer) and the pca9632@62 (supplier). Instead it is created between the\nbacklight-addon (consumer) and the parent of the pca9632@62, which is\ntypically the I2C bus adapter.\n\nOn removal of the above overlay, the LED driver can be removed before the\nbacklight device, resulting in:\n\n    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010\n    ...\n    Call trace:\n     led_put+0xe0/0x140\n     devm_led_release+0x6c/0x98\n\nAnother way to reproduce the bug without any device tree overlays is\nunbinding the LED class device (pca9632@62) before unbinding the consumer\n(backlight-addon):\n\n

OnAssocReq IE parsing\n\nThe Supported Rates IE length from an incoming Association Request frame\nwas used directly as the memcpy() length when copying into a fixed-size\n16-byte stack buffer (supportRate).

ESR IE parsing\n\nThe Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling in OnBeacon accessed\n*(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these\noffsets lie within the received frame buffer. A malformed beacon with\nan ESR IE positioned at the end of the buffer could cause an\nout-of-bounds read, potentially triggering a kernel panic.\n\nAdd a boundary check to ensure that the ESR IE body

tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling\n\nWhen the CPU that the QSPI interrupt handler runs on (typically CPU 0)\nis excessively busy, it can lead to rare cases of the IRQ thread not\nrunning before the transfer timeout is reached.\n\nWhile handling the timeouts, any pending transfers are cleaned up and\nthe message that they correspond to is marked as failed, which leaves\nthe curr_xfer field pointing at stale memory.\n\nTo avoid this, clear curr_xfer to NULL upon timeout and check for this\ncondition when the IRQ thread is finally run.\n\nWhile at it, also make sure to clear interrupts on failure so that new\ninterrupts can be run.\n\nA better, more involved, fix would move the interrupt clearing into a\nhard IRQ handler. Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ\nthread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the\nextra check for a valid

Remove RTNL dance for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: Remove RTNL dance for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.\n\nSIOCBRDELIF is passed to dev_ioctl() first and later forwarded to\nbr_ioctl_call(), which causes unnecessary RTNL dance and the splat\nbelow [0] under RTNL pressure.\n\nLet's say Thread A is trying to detach a device from a bridge and\nThread B is trying to remove the bridge.\n\nIn dev_ioctl(), Thread A bumps the bridge device's refcnt by\nnetdev_hold() and releases RTNL because the following br_ioctl_call()\nalso re-acquires RTNL.\n\nIn the race window, Thread B could acquire RTNL and try to remove\nthe bridge device.  Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL\nand wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.\n\nThread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),\nwhich may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by\nThread B.\n\n  Thread A (SIOCBRDELIF)           Thread B (SIOCBRDELBR)\n  ----------------------           ----------------------\n  sock_ioctl                       sock_ioctl\n  `- sock_do_ioctl                 `- br_ioctl_call\n     `- dev_ioctl                     `- br_ioctl_stub\n        |- rtnl_lock                     |\n        |- dev_ifsioc                    '\n        '  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n           |- netdev_hold(dev, ...)      .\n       /   |- rtnl_unlock  ------.       |\n       |   |- br_ioctl_call       `--->  |- rtnl_lock\n  Race |   |  `- br_ioctl_stub           |- br_del_bridge\n  Window   |     |                       |  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n       |   |     |  May take long        |  `- br_dev_delete(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |  under RTNL pressure  |     `- unregister_netdevice_queue(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |               |       `- rtnl_unlock\n       \\   |     |- rtnl_lock  <-'          `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     |- ...                        `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     `- rtnl_unlock                   |- __rtnl_unlock\n           |                                      |- netdev_wait_allrefs_any\n           |- netdev_put(dev, ...)  <----------------'\n                                                Wait refcnt decrement\n                                                and log splat below\n\nTo avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call\ndev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.\n\nIn the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:\n\n  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()\n  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()\n  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()\n  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()\n\n3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move\n1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().\n\nNote that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better\nperformed before RTNL.\n\nSIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since\nthe pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process\nthem there.\n\n[0]:\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for wpan3 to become free.

rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in rtw_get_ie() parser","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in rtw_get_ie() parser\n\nThe Information Element (IE) parser rtw_get_ie() trusted the length\nbyte of each IE without validating that the IE body (len bytes after\nthe 2-byte header) fits inside the remaining frame buffer. A malformed\nframe can advertise an IE length larger than the available data, causing\nthe parser to increment its pointer beyond the buffer end. This results\nin out-of-bounds reads or, depending on the pattern, an infinite loop.\n\nFix by validating that (offset + 2 + len) does not exceed the limit\nbefore accepting the IE or advancing to the

xfrm_state_find\n\nIn case of preemption, xfrm_state_look_at will find a different\npcpu_id and look up states for that other CPU. If we matched a state\nfor CPU2 in the state_cache while the lookup started on CPU1, we will\njump to \"found\", but the \"best\" state that we got will be ignored and\nwe will enter the \"acquire\" block.

Use RCU in blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() instead of set->tag_list_lock","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: Use RCU in blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() instead of set->tag_list_lock\n\nblk_mq_{add,del}_queue_tag_set() functions add and remove queues from\ntagset, the functions make sure that tagset and queues are marked as\nshared when two or more queues are attached to the same tagset.\nInitially a tagset starts as unshared and when the number of added\nqueues reaches two, blk_mq_add_queue_tag_set() marks it as shared along\nwith all the queues attached to it. When the number of attached queues\ndrops to 1 blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() need to mark both the tagset and\nthe remaining queues as unshared.\n\nBoth functions need to freeze current queues in tagset before setting on\nunsetting BLK_MQ_F_TAG_QUEUE_SHARED flag. While doing so, both functions\nhold set->tag_list_lock mutex, which makes sense as we do not want\nqueues to be added or deleted in the process. This used to work fine\nuntil commit 98d81f0df70c (\"nvme: use blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset\")\nmade the nvme driver quiesce tagset instead of quiscing individual\nqueues. blk_mq_quiesce_tagset() does the job and quiesce the queues in\nset->tag_list while holding set->tag_list_lock also.\n\nThis results in deadlock between two threads with these stacktraces:\n\n  __schedule+0x47c/0xbb0\n  ? timerqueue_add+0x66/0xb0\n  schedule+0x1c/0xa0\n  schedule_preempt_disabled+0xa/0x10\n  __mutex_lock.constprop.0+0x271/0x600\n  blk_mq_quiesce_tagset+0x25/0xc0\n  nvme_dev_disable+0x9c/0x250\n  nvme_timeout+0x1fc/0x520\n  blk_mq_handle_expired+0x5c/0x90\n  bt_iter+0x7e/0x90\n  blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter+0x27e/0x550\n  ? __blk_mq_complete_request_remote+0x10/0x10\n  ? __blk_mq_complete_request_remote+0x10/0x10\n  ? __call_rcu_common.constprop.0+0x1c0/0x210\n  blk_mq_timeout_work+0x12d/0x170\n  process_one_work+0x12e/0x2d0\n  worker_thread+0x288/0x3a0\n  ? rescuer_thread+0x480/0x480\n  kthread+0xb8/0xe0\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n  ? kthread_park+0x80/0x80\n  ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n\n  __schedule+0x47c/0xbb0\n  ? xas_find+0x161/0x1a0\n  schedule+0x1c/0xa0\n  blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait+0x3d/0x70\n  ? destroy_sched_domains_rcu+0x30/0x30\n  blk_mq_update_tag_set_shared+0x44/0x80\n  blk_mq_exit_queue+0x141/0x150\n  del_gendisk+0x25a/0x2d0\n  nvme_ns_remove+0xc9/0x170\n  nvme_remove_namespaces+0xc7/0x100\n  nvme_remove+0x62/0x150\n  pci_device_remove+0x23/0x60\n  device_release_driver_internal+0x159/0x200\n  unbind_store+0x99/0xa0\n  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x112/0x1e0\n  vfs_write+0x2b1/0x3d0\n  ksys_write+0x4e/0xb0\n  do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x160\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nThe top stacktrace is showing nvme_timeout() called to handle nvme\ncommand timeout. timeout handler is trying to disable the controller and\nas a first step, it needs to blk_mq_quiesce_tagset() to tell blk-mq not\nto call queue callback handlers. The thread is stuck waiting for\nset->tag_list_lock as it tries to walk the queues in set->tag_list.\n\nThe lock is held by the second thread in the bottom stack which is\nwaiting for one of queues to be frozen. The queue usage counter will\ndrop to zero after nvme_timeout() finishes, and this will not happen\nbecause the thread will wait for this mutex forever.\n\nGiven that [un]quiescing queue is an operation that does not need to\nsleep, update blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() to use RCU instead of taking\nset->tag_list_lock, update blk_mq_{add,del}_queue_tag_set() to use RCU\nsafe list operations.

check device's attached status in compat ioctls","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: check device's attached status in compat ioctls\n\nSyzbot identified an issue [1] that crashes kernel, seemingly due to\nunexistent callback dev->get_valid_routes(). By all means, this should\nnot occur as said callback must always be set to\nget_zero_valid_routes() in __comedi_device_postconfig().\n\nAs the crash seems to appear exclusively in i386 kernels, at least,\njudging from [1] reports, the blame lies with compat versions\nof standard IOCTL handlers. Several of them are modified and\ndo not use comedi_unlocked_ioctl(). While functionality of these\nioctls essentially copy their original versions, they do not\nhave required sanity check for device's attached status. This,\nin turn, leads to a possibility of calling select IOCTLs on a\ndevice that has not been properly setup, even via COMEDI_DEVCONFIG.\n\nDoing so on unconfigured devices means that several crucial steps\nare missed, for instance, specifying dev->get_valid_routes()\ncallback.\n\nFix this somewhat crudely by ensuring device's attached status before\nperforming any ioctls, improving logic consistency between modern\nand compat functions.\n\n[1] Syzbot report:\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n...\nCR2: ffffffffffffffd6 CR3: 000000006c717000 CR4:

aborted\n\nOnce command submission failed due to userptr invalidation in\namdgpu_cs_submit, legacy code will perform cleanup of scheduler\njob.

xfrm_state_delete_tunnel at destroy time for states that were never added\n\nIn commit b441cf3f8c4b (\"xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x\"), I\nmissed the case where state creation fails between full\ninitialization (->init_state has been called) and being inserted on\nthe lists.\n\nIn this situation, ->init_state has been called, so for IPcomp\ntunnels, the fallback tunnel has been created and added onto the\nlists, but the user state never gets added, because we fail before\nthat. The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we\ndon't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up\nleaking the FB tunnel.\n\nThere are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in\nboth net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,\nxfrm_state_migrate). A \"proper\" rollback of the init_state work would\nprobably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets\nmore complicated as multiple states may be involved.\n\nAt some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call\nxfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states\nwill have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,\nwhich solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)\naimed at.

Such lockups\nhave been observed in real world after stmmac_xmit() on one CPU raced with\nstmmac_napi_poll_tx() on another CPU.\n\nTo fix the issue without introducing a new lock, split the statics into\nthree parts:\n\n1. fields updated only under the tx queue lock,\n2. fields updated only during NAPI poll,\n3. fields updated only from interrupt context,\n\nUpdates to fields in the first two groups are already serialized through\nother locks. It is sufficient to split the existing struct u64_stats_sync\nso that each group has its own.\n\nNote that tx_set_ic_bit is updated from both contexts. Split this counter\nso that each context gets its own, and calculate their sum to get the total\nvalue in stmmac_get_ethtool_stats().\n\nFor the third group, multiple interrupts may be processed by different CPUs\nat the same time, but interrupts on the same CPU will not nest.

nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections\n\nSequence adjustment may be required for FTP traffic with PASV/EPSV modes.\ndue to need to re-write packet payload (IP, port) on the ftp control\nconnection. This can require changes to the TCP length and expected\nseq / ack_seq.\n\nThe easiest way to reproduce this issue is with PASV mode.\nExample ruleset:\ntable inet ftp_nat {\n        ct helper ftp_helper {\n                type \"ftp\" protocol tcp\n                l3proto inet\n        }\n\n        chain prerouting {\n                type filter hook prerouting priority 0; policy accept;\n                tcp dport 21 ct state new ct helper set \"ftp_helper\"\n        }\n}\ntable ip nat {\n        chain prerouting {\n                type nat hook prerouting priority -100; policy accept;\n                tcp dport 21 dnat ip prefix to ip daddr map {\n\t\t\t192.168.100.1 : 192.168.13.2/32 }\n        }\n\n        chain postrouting {\n                type nat hook postrouting

the dnat setup.\n\nThe inverse (nat after helper assign) is handled by an existing\ncheck in nf_nat_setup_info() and will not show the problem.\n\nTopoloy:\n\n +-------------------+

Fix race in push_rt_task","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task\n\nOverview\n========\nWhen a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to\nanother CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method\nwhich would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the\nlocks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current\nrunqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window\nit is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some\nother CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is\nmigrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to\nwake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue\n(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the\ncurrent checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no\nlonger in the pushable tasks list.\n\nCrashes\n=======\nThis bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel\npanics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page\nfaults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all\ncoming from scheduler itself.\n\nSome of the crashes:\n-> kernel BUG at kernel/sched/rt.c:1616!

Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/core: Prevent rescheduling when interrupts are disabled\n\nDavid reported a warning observed while loop testing kexec jump:\n\n  Interrupts enabled after irqrouter_resume+0x0/0x50\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 560 at drivers/base/syscore.c:103 syscore_resume+0x18a/0x220\n   kernel_kexec+0xf6/0x180\n   __do_sys_reboot+0x206/0x250\n   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180\n\nThe corresponding interrupt flag trace:\n\n  hardirqs last  enabled at (15573): [<ffffffffa8281b8e>] __up_console_sem+0x7e/0x90\n  hardirqs last disabled at (15580): [<ffffffffa8281b73>] __up_console_sem+0x63/0x90\n\nThat means __up_console_sem() was invoked with interrupts enabled. Further\ninstrumentation revealed that in the interrupt disabled section of kexec\njump one of the syscore_suspend() callbacks woke up a task, which set the\nNEED_RESCHED flag. A later callback in the resume path invoked\ncond_resched() which in turn led to the invocation of the scheduler:\n\n  __cond_resched+0x21/0x60\n  down_timeout+0x18/0x60\n  acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x4c/0x80\n  acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x3d/0x100\n  acpi_ns_get_node+0x27/0x60\n  acpi_ns_evaluate+0x1cb/0x2d0\n  acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data+0x156/0x190\n  acpi_pci_link_set+0x11c/0x290\n  irqrouter_resume+0x54/0x60\n  syscore_resume+0x6a/0x200\n  kernel_kexec+0x145/0x1c0\n  __do_sys_reboot+0xeb/0x240\n  do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180\n\nThis is a long standing problem, which probably got more visible with\nthe recent printk changes. Something does a task wakeup and the\nscheduler sets the NEED_RESCHED flag. cond_resched() sees it set and\ninvokes schedule() from a completely bogus context. The scheduler\nenables interrupts after context switching, which causes the above\nwarning at the end.\n\nQuite some of the code paths in syscore_suspend()/resume() can result in\ntriggering a wakeup with the exactly same consequences. They might not\nhave done so yet, but as they share a lot of code with normal operations\nit's just a question of time.\n\nThe problem only affects the PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY scheduling\nmodels.

related to our space reservation\ncode, let's just focus on the error handling.\n\nFor example, we have the following dirty range [0, 64K) of an inode,\nwith 4K sector size and 4K page size:\n\n   0        16K        32K       48K       64K\n   |///////////////////////////////////////|\n   |#######################################|\n\nWhere |///| means page are still dirty, and |###| means the extent io\ntree has EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.\n\n- Enter extent_writepage() for page 0\n\n- Enter btrfs_run_delalloc_range() for range [0, 64K)\n\n- Enter cow_file_range() for range [0, 64K)\n\n- Function btrfs_reserve_extent() only reserved one 16K extent\n  So we created extent map and ordered extent for range [0, 16K)\n\n   0        16K        32K       48K       64K\n   |////////|//////////////////////////////|\n   |<- OE ->|##############################|\n\n   And range [0, 16K) has its delalloc flag cleared.\n   But since we haven't yet submit any bio, involved 4 pages are still\n   dirty.\n\n- Function btrfs_reserve_extent() returns with -ENOSPC\n  Now we have to run error cleanup, which will clear all\n  EXTENT_DELALLOC* flags and clear the dirty flags for the remaining\n  ranges:\n\n   0        16K        32K       48K       64K\n   |////////|                              |\n   |        |                              |\n\n  Note that range [0, 16K) still has its pages dirty.\n\n- Some time later, writeback is triggered again for the range [0, 16K)\n  since the page range still has dirty flags.\n\n- btrfs_run_delalloc_range() will do nothing because there is no\n  EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.\n\n- extent_writepage_io() finds page 0 has no ordered flag\n  Which falls into the COW fixup path, triggering the BUG_ON().\n\nUnfortunately this error handling bug dates back to the introduction of\nbtrfs.  Thankfully with the abuse of COW fixup, at least it won't crash\nthe kernel.\n\n[FIX]\nInstead of immediately unlocking the extent and folios, we keep the extent\nand folios locked until either erroring out or the whole delalloc range\nfinished.\n\nWhen the whole delalloc range finished without error, we just unlock the\nwhole range with PAGE_SET_ORDERED (and PAGE_UNLOCK for

a kernel warning when netconsole setup fails on devices with\nIFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL flag. The warning (at kernel/workqueue.c:4242 in\n__flush_work) occurs because the cleanup path tries to cancel an\nuninitialized work queue.\n\nWhen __netpoll_setup() encounters a device with IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL,\nit fails early and calls skb_pool_flush() for cleanup. This function\ncalls cancel_work_sync(&np->refill_wq), but refill_wq hasn't been\ninitialized yet, triggering the warning.\n\nMove INIT_WORK() to the beginning of __netpoll_setup(), ensuring the\nwork queue is properly initialized before any potential failure points.\nThis allows the cleanup path to safely cancel the work queue regardless\nof where the setup fails.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"248f6571fd4c51531f7f8f07f186f7ae98a50afc"},{"fixed":"a90d0dc38a10347078cca60e7495ad0648838f18"},{"fixed":"760bc6ceda8e2c273c0e2018ad2595967c3dd308"},{"fixed":"e5235eb6cfe02a51256013a78f7b28779a7740d5"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.10","v6.17.11","v6.17.12","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6","v6.18-rc7","v6.18.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68762.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.13"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.18.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-68762.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/760bc6ceda8e2c273c0e2018ad2595967c3dd308"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a90d0dc38a10347078cca60e7495ad0648838f18"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e5235eb6cfe02a51256013a78f7b28779a7740d5"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68762.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68762"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/68xxx/CVE-2025-68762.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-12T12:33:08.401157Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2024-56596","published":"2024-12-27T14:51:03.282Z","modified":"2026-01-06T03:21:20.793294Z","related":["MGASA-2025-0030","MGASA-2025-0032","SUSE-SU-2025:0289-1","SUSE-SU-2025:0428-1","SUSE-SU-2025:0499-1","SUSE-SU-2025:0556-1","SUSE-SU-2025:0557-1","SUSE-SU-2025:0577-1","SUSE-SU-2025:0577-2","USN-7379-2","USN-7380-1"],"summary":"jfs: fix array-index-out-of-bounds in jfs_readdir","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: fix array-index-out-of-bounds in jfs_readdir\n\nThe stbl might contain some invalid values.
