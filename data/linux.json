[{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50626","published":"2025-12-08T01:16:40.754Z","modified":"2025-12-08T08:34:00.185819Z","summary":"media: dvb-usb: fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: dvb-usb: fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()\n\nSyzbot reports a memory leak in \"dvb_usb_adapter_init()\".\nThe leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's\nadapter->priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs,\nit will exit before incrementing \"num_adapters_initalized\",\nwhich is used as a reference counter to free all adap->priv\nin \"dvb_usb_adapter_exit()\". There are multiple error paths that\ncan exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the\nerror handling paths for \"dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()\",\n\"dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()\" and \"dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()\"\nwithin \"dvb_usb_adapter_init()\".\n\nThis means that in case of an error in any of these functions the\ncurrent iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's\nadap->priv is not freed.\n\nFix this by freeing the current iteration's adap->priv in the\n\"stream_init_err:\" label in the error path. The rest of the\n(accounted for) adap->priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit()\nas expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.\n\nSyzbot report:\n\nBUG: memory leak\nunreferenced

MGMT: Fix OOB access in parse_adv_monitor_pattern()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: MGMT: Fix OOB access in parse_adv_monitor_pattern()\n\nIn the parse_adv_monitor_pattern() function, the value of\nthe 'length' variable is currently limited to HCI_MAX_EXT_AD_LENGTH(251).\nThe size of the 'value' array in the mgmt_adv_pattern structure is 31.\nIf the value of 'pattern[i].length' is set in the user space\nand exceeds 31, the 'patterns[i].value' array can be accessed\nout of bound when

amba-pl011: avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nserial: amba-pl011: avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register\n\nChapter \"B Generic UART\" in \"ARM Server Base System Architecture\" [1]\ndocumentation describes a generic UART interface. Such generic UART\ndoes not support DMA. In current code, sbsa_uart_pops and\namba_pl011_pops share the same stop_rx operation, which will invoke\npl011_dma_rx_stop, leading to an access of the DMACR register. This\ncommit adds a using_rx_dma check in pl011_dma_rx_stop to avoid the\naccess to DMACR register for SBSA UARTs which does not support DMA.\n\nWhen the kernel enables DMA engine with \"CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y\", Linux\nSBSA PL011 driver will access PL011 DMACR register in some functions.\nFor most real SBSA Pl011 hardware implementations, the DMACR write\nbehaviour will be ignored. So these DMACR operations will not cause\nobvious problems. But for some virtual SBSA PL011 hardware, like Xen\nvirtual SBSA PL011 (vpl011) device, the behaviour might be different.\nXen vpl011 emulation will inject a data abort to guest, when guest is\naccessing an unimplemented UART register. As Xen VPL011 is SBSA\ncompatible, it will not implement DMACR register.

Add bounds checking in bit_putcs to fix vmalloc-out-of-bounds","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: Add bounds checking in bit_putcs to fix vmalloc-out-of-bounds\n\nAdd bounds checking to prevent writes past framebuffer boundaries when\nrendering text near screen edges. Return early if the Y position is off-screen\nand clip image height to screen boundary. Break from the rendering loop if the\nX position is off-screen. When clipping image width to fit the screen, update\nthe character count to match the clipped width to prevent buffer size\nmismatches.\n\nWithout the character count update, bit_putcs_aligned and bit_putcs_unaligned\nreceive mismatched parameters where the buffer is allocated for the clipped\nwidth but cnt reflects the original larger count, causing out-of-bounds

In the remove() path, mmc_remove_host() will be called to\n   delete device, but it's not added yet, it will lead a kernel\n   crash because of null-ptr-deref in device_del().\n\nFix this by checking

coherent memory\n\nWhen IOMMU is enabled, dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_USER may return\naddresses from the vmalloc range. If such an address is mapped without\nVM_MIXEDMAP, vm_insert_page() will trigger a BUG_ON due to the\nVM_PFNMAP restriction.\n\nFix this by checking for vmalloc addresses and setting VM_MIXEDMAP\nin the VMA before mapping. This ensures safe mapping and avoids kernel\ncrashes.

fix xattr related buffer overflow...","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\norangefs: fix xattr related buffer overflow...\n\nWilly Tarreau <w@1wt.eu> forwarded me a message from\nDisclosure <disclosure@aisle.com> with the following\nwarning:\n\n> The helper `xattr_key()` uses the pointer variable in the loop condition\n> rather than dereferencing it. As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL\n> (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on\n> valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging\n> the thread.\n\nI easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel\noops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure\nsent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based\nthis patch on.\n\nAfter xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an\nxattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns\na hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs\nused hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using\nhash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong\nhash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a\ngetattr for the xattr \"security.capability\" every time. Orangefs\nnegative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the\nxattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for\n\"security.capability\" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were\never freed.\n\nI changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead\nand the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing

gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.\n\nA race condition occurs when ffs_func_eps_enable() runs concurrently\nwith ffs_data_reset(). The ffs_data_clear() called in ffs_data_reset()\nsets ffs->epfiles to NULL before resetting ffs->eps_count to 0, leading\nto a NULL pointer dereference when accessing epfile->ep in\nffs_func_eps_enable() after successful usb_ep_enable().\n\nThe ffs->epfiles pointer is set to NULL in both ffs_data_clear() and\nffs_data_close() functions, and its modification is protected by the\nspinlock ffs->eps_lock. And the whole ffs_func_eps_enable() function\nis also protected by ffs->eps_lock.\n\nThus, add NULL pointer handling for ffs->epfiles in the\nffs_func_eps_enable() function to fix

hugetlb: fix UAF in hugetlb_handle_userfault","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: hugetlb: fix UAF in hugetlb_handle_userfault\n\nThe vma_lock and hugetlb_fault_mutex are dropped before handling userfault\nand reacquire them again after handle_userfault(), but reacquire the\nvma_lock could lead to UAF[1,2] due to the following race,\n\nhugetlb_fault\n  hugetlb_no_page\n    /*unlock vma_lock */\n    hugetlb_handle_userfault\n      handle_userfault\n        /* unlock mm->mmap_lock*/\n                                           vm_mmap_pgoff\n                                             do_mmap\n                                               mmap_region\n                                                 munmap_vma_range\n

registered\nthe regulator would pass its parent as the parameter. And this causes\ninit data resource allocated to its parent, not itself. The issue happen\nwhen parent device is going to release and regulator core is still doing\nsome operation of init data constraint for the regulator of child device.\n\nTo fix it, this patch expand 'regulator_register' API to use the\ndifferent devices for init data allocation and DT

Use-after-free during failed initialization and exit of cdnsp gadget\n\nIn the __cdnsp_gadget_init() and cdnsp_gadget_exit() functions, the gadget\nstructure (pdev->gadget) was freed before its endpoints.\nThe endpoints are linked via the ep_list in the gadget structure.\nFreeing the gadget first leaves dangling pointers in the endpoint list.\nWhen the endpoints are subsequently freed, this

fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/vfio-ap: fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver\n\nThe device release callback function invoked to release the matrix device\nuses the dev_get_drvdata(device *dev) function to retrieve the\npointer to the vfio_matrix_dev object in order to free its storage. The\nproblem is, this object is not stored as drvdata with the device; since the\nkfree function will accept a NULL pointer, the memory for the\nvfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.\n\nSince the device being released is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev\nobject, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve its pointer.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1fde573413b549d52183382e639c1d6ce88f5959"},{"fixed":"5195de1d5f66b276683240a896783f7f43c4f664"},{"fixed":"ee17dea3072dec0bc34399a32fa884e26342e4ea"},{"fixed":"aa2bff25e9bb10c935c7ffe3d5f5975bdccb1749"},{"fixed":"6a40fda14b4be3e38f03cc42ffd4efbc64fb3e67"},{"fixed":"7b6a02f5bf15931464c79dfd487c57f76aae3496"},{"fixed":"8f8cf767589f2131ae5d40f3758429095c701c84"}]}],"versions":["v4.19","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.10.1","v5.10.10","v5.10.100","v5.10.101","v5.10.102","v5.10.103","v5.10.104","v5.10.105","v5.10.106","v5.10.107","v5.10.108","v5.10.109","v5.10.11","v5.10.110","v5.10.111","v5.10.112","v5.10.113","v5.10.114","v5.10.115","v5.10.116","v5.10.117","v5.10.118","v5.10.119","v5.10.12","v5.10.120","v5.10.121","v5.10.122","v5.10.123","v5.10.124","v5.10.125","v5.10.126","v5.10.127","v5.10.128","v5.10.129","v5.10.13","v5.10.130","v5.10.131","v5.10.132","v5.10.133","v5.10.134","v5.10.135","v5.10.136","v5.10.137","v5.10.138","v5.10.139","v5.10.14","v5.10.140","v5.10.141","v5.10.142","v5.10.143","v5.10.144","v5.10.145","v5.10.146","v5.10.147","v5.10.148","v5.10.149","v5.10.15","v5.10.150","v5.10.151","v5.10.152","v5.10.153","v5.10.154","v5.10.155","v5.10.156","v5.10.157","v5.10.158","v5.10.159","v5.10.16","v5.10.160","v5.10.161","v5.10.162","v5.10.163","v5.10.164","v5.10.165","v5.10.166","v5.10.167","v5.10.168","v5.10.169","v5.10.17","v5.10.170","v5.10.171","v5.10.172","v5.10.173","v5.10.174","v5.10.175","v5.10.176","v5.10.18","v5.10.19","v5.10.2","v5.10.20","v5.10.21","v5.10.22","v5.10.23","v5.10.24","v5.10.25","v5.10.26","v5.10.27","v5.10.28","v5.10.29","v5.10.3","v5.10.30","v5.10.31","v5.10.32","v5.10.33","v5.10.34","v5.10.35","v5.10.36","v5.10.37","v5.10.38","v5.10.39","v5.10.4","v5.10.40","v5.10.41","v5.10.42","v5.10.43","v5.10.44","v5.10.45","v5.10.46","v5.10.47","v5.10.48","v5.10.49","v5.10.5","v5.10.50","v5.10.51","v5.10.52","v5.10.53","v5.10.54","v5.10.55","v5.10.56","v5.10.57","v5.10.58","v5.10.59","v5.10.6","v5.10.60","v5.10.61","v5.10.62","v5.10.63","v5.10.64","v5.10.65","v5.10.66","v5.10.67","v5.10.68","v5.10.69","v5.10.7","v5.10.70","v5.10.71","v5.10.72","v5.10.73","v5.10.74","v5.10.75","v5.10.76","v5.10.77","v5.10.78","v5.10.79","v5.10.8","v5.10.80","v5.10.81","v5.10.82","v5.10.83","v5.10.84","v5.10.85","v5.10.86","v5.10.87","v5.10.88","v5.10.89","v5.10.9","v5.10.90","v5.10.91","v5.10.92","v5.10.93","v5.10.94","v5.10.95","v5.10.96","v5.10.97","v5.10.98","v5.10.99","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2",

Frames in standalone AP Mode\n\nCurrently, whenever there is a need to transmit an Action frame,\nthe brcmfmac driver always uses the P2P vif to send the \"actframe\" IOVAR to\nfirmware. The P2P interfaces were available when wpa_supplicant is managing\nthe wlan interface.\n\nHowever, the P2P interfaces are not created/initialized when only hostapd\nis managing the wlan interface. And if hostapd receives an ANQP Query REQ\nAction frame even from an un-associated STA, the brcmfmac driver tries\nto use an uninitialized P2P vif pointer for sending the IOVAR to firmware.\nThis NULL pointer dereferencing triggers a driver crash.\n\n [ 1417.074538] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual\n address 0000000000000000\n [...]\n [ 1417.075188] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.5 (DT)\n [...]\n [ 1417.075653] Call trace:\n [ 1417.075662]  brcmf_p2p_send_action_frame+0x23c/0xc58 [brcmfmac]\n [ 1417.075738]  brcmf_cfg80211_mgmt_tx+0x304/0x5c0 [brcmfmac]\n [ 1417.075810]  cfg80211_mlme_mgmt_tx+0x1b0/0x428 [cfg80211]\n [ 1417.076067]  nl80211_tx_mgmt+0x238/0x388 [cfg80211]\n [ 1417.076281]  genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0xe0/0x158\n [ 1417.076302]  genl_rcv_msg+0x220/0x2a0\n [ 1417.076317]  netlink_rcv_skb+0x68/0x140\n [ 1417.076330]  genl_rcv+0x40/0x60\n [ 1417.076343]  netlink_unicast+0x330/0x3b8\n [ 1417.076357]  netlink_sendmsg+0x19c/0x3f8\n [ 1417.076370]  __sock_sendmsg+0x64/0xc0\n [ 1417.076391]  ____sys_sendmsg+0x268/0x2a0\n [ 1417.076408]  ___sys_sendmsg+0xb8/0x118\n [ 1417.076427]  __sys_sendmsg+0x90/0xf8\n [ 1417.076445]  __arm64_sys_sendmsg+0x2c/0x40\n [ 1417.076465]  invoke_syscall+0x50/0x120\n [ 1417.076486]  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x48/0xf0\n [ 1417.076506]  do_el0_svc+0x24/0x38\n [ 1417.076525]  el0_svc+0x30/0x100\n [ 1417.076548]  el0t_64_sync_handler+0x100/0x130\n [ 1417.076569]  el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x198\n [ 1417.076589] Code: f9401e80 aa1603e2 f9403be1 5280e483 (f9400000)\n\nFix this, by always using the vif corresponding to the wdev on which the\nAction frame Transmission request was initiated by the userspace. This way,\neven if P2P vif is not available, the IOVAR is sent to firmware on AP vif\nand the ANQP Query RESP Action frame is transmitted without crashing the\ndriver.\n\nMove init_completion() for \"send_af_done\" from brcmf_p2p_create_p2pdev()\nto brcmf_p2p_attach(). Because the former function would not get executed\nwhen only hostapd is managing wlan interface, and it is not safe to do\nreinit_completion() later in brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame(), without any prior\ninit_completion().\n\nAnd in the brcmf_p2p_tx_action_frame() function, the condition check for\nP2P Presence response frame is not needed, since the wpa_supplicant is\nproperly sending the P2P

ensure no dirty metadata is written back for an fs with errors","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: ensure no dirty metadata is written back for an fs with errors\n\n[BUG]\nDuring development of a minor feature (make sure all btrfs_bio::end_io()\nis called in task context), I noticed a crash in generic/388, where\nmetadata writes triggered new works after btrfs_stop_all_workers().\n\nIt turns out that it can even happen without any code modification, just\nusing RAID5 for metadata and the same workload from generic/388 is going\nto trigger the use-after-free.\n\n[CAUSE]\nIf btrfs hits an error, the fs is marked as error, no new\ntransaction is allowed thus metadata is in a frozen state.\n\nBut there are some metadata modifications before that error, and they are\nstill in the btree inode page cache.\n\nSince there will be no real transaction commit, all those dirty folios\nare just kept as is in the page cache, and they can not be invalidated\nby invalidate_inode_pages2() call inside close_ctree(), because they are\ndirty.\n\nAnd finally after btrfs_stop_all_workers(), we call iput() on btree\ninode, which triggers writeback of those dirty metadata.\n\nAnd if the fs is using RAID56 metadata, this will trigger RMW and queue\nnew works into rmw_workers, which is already stopped, causing warning\nfrom queue_work() and use-after-free.\n\n[FIX]\nAdd a special handling for write_one_eb(), that if the fs is already in\nan error state, immediately mark the bbio as failure, instead of really\nsubmitting them.\n\nThen during close_ctree(), iput() will just discard all those dirty\ntree blocks without really writing them back, thus no more new jobs for\nalready stopped-and-freed workqueues.\n\nThe extra discard in write_one_eb() also acts as an extra safenet.\nE.g. the transaction abort is triggered by some extent/free space\ntree corruptions, and since extent/free space tree is already corrupted\nsome tree

VMX: Fix crash due to uninitialized current_vmcs","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: VMX: Fix crash due to uninitialized current_vmcs\n\nKVM enables 'Enlightened VMCS' and 'Enlightened MSR Bitmap' when running as\na nested hypervisor on top of Hyper-V. When MSR bitmap is updated,\nevmcs_touch_msr_bitmap function uses current_vmcs per-cpu variable to mark\nthat the msr bitmap was changed.\n\nvmx_vcpu_create() modifies the msr bitmap via vmx_disable_intercept_for_msr\n-> vmx_msr_bitmap_l01_changed which in the end calls this function. The\nfunction checks for current_vmcs if it is null but the check is\ninsufficient because current_vmcs is not initialized. Because of this, the\ncode might incorrectly write to the structure pointed by current_vmcs value\nleft by another task. Preemption is not disabled, the current task can be\npreempted and moved to another CPU while current_vmcs is accessed multiple\ntimes from evmcs_touch_msr_bitmap() which leads to crash.\n\nThe manipulation of MSR bitmaps by callers happens only for vmcs01 so the\nsolution is to use vmx->vmcs01.vmcs instead of current_vmcs.\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:

validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexfat: validate cluster allocation bits of the allocation bitmap\n\nsyzbot created an exfat image with cluster bits not set for the allocation\nbitmap. exfat-fs reads and uses the allocation bitmap without checking\nthis. The problem is that if the start cluster of the allocation bitmap\nis 6, cluster 6 can be allocated when creating a directory with mkdir.\nexfat zeros out this cluster in exfat_mkdir, which can delete existing\nentries. This can reallocate the allocated entries. In addition,\nthe allocation bitmap is also zeroed out, so cluster 6 can be reallocated.\nThis patch adds exfat_test_bitmap_range to validate that clusters used for\nthe allocation bitmap are correctly marked as

Fix device use-after-free on unbind","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/mediatek: Fix device use-after-free on unbind\n\nA recent change fixed device reference leaks when looking up drm\nplatform device driver data during bind() but failed to remove a partial\nfix which had been added by commit 80805b62ea5b (\"drm/mediatek: Fix\nkobject put for component sub-drivers\").\n\nThis results in a reference imbalance on component bind() failures and\non unbind() which could lead to a user-after-free.\n\nMake sure to only drop the references after

doesn't set Rworksched and doesn't do schedule_work(m->rq)\nif list_empty(&m->req_list).\n\nHowever, if the pipe is full, we need to read more data and this used to\nwork prior to commit aaec5a95d59615 (\"pipe_read: don't wake up the writer\nif the pipe is still full\").\n\np9_read_work() does p9_fd_read() -> ... -> anon_pipe_read() which (before\nthe commit above) triggered the unnecessary wakeup. This wakeup calls\np9_pollwake() which kicks p9_poll_workfn() -> p9_poll_mux(), p9_poll_mux()\nwill notice EPOLLIN and schedule_work(&m->rq).\n\nThis no longer happens after the optimization above, change p9_fd_request()\nto use p9_poll_mux() instead of only checking for

30f241fcf52a (\"xsk: Fix immature cq descriptor\nproduction\"), the descriptor number is stored in skb control block and\nxsk_cq_submit_addr_locked() relies on it to put the umem addrs onto\npool's

bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: bridge: fix use-after-free due to MST port state bypass\n\nsyzbot reported[1] a use-after-free when deleting an expired fdb. It is\ndue to a race condition between learning still happening and a port being\ndeleted, after all its fdbs have been flushed. The port's state has been\ntoggled to disabled so no learning should happen at that time, but if we\nhave MST enabled, it will bypass the port's state, that together with VLAN\nfiltering disabled can lead to fdb learning at a time when it shouldn't\nhappen while the port is being deleted. VLAN filtering must be disabled\nbecause we flush the port VLANs when it's being deleted which will stop\nlearning. This fix adds a check for the port's vlan group which is\ninitialized to NULL when the port is getting deleted, that avoids the port\nstate bypass. When MST is enabled there would be a minimal new overhead\nin the fast-path because the port's vlan group pointer is cache-hot.\n\n[1]

deal with integer overflows in kmalloc_reserve()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: deal with integer overflows in kmalloc_reserve()\n\nBlamed commit changed:\n    ptr = kmalloc(size);\n    if (ptr)\n      size = ksize(ptr);\n\n    size = kmalloc_size_roundup(size);\n    ptr = kmalloc(size);\n\nThis allowed various crash as reported by syzbot [1]\nand Kyle Zeng.\n\nProblem is that if @size is bigger than 0x80000001,\nkmalloc_size_roundup(size) returns 2^32.\n\nkmalloc_reserve() uses a 32bit variable (obj_size),\nso 2^32 is truncated to 0.\n\nkmalloc(0) returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR which is not handled by\nskb allocations.\n\nFollowing trace can be triggered if a netdev->mtu is set\nclose to 0x7fffffff\n\nWe might in the future limit netdev->mtu to more sensible\nlimit (like KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE).\n\nThis patch is based on a syzbot report, and also a report\nand tentative fix from Kyle Zeng.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: user-memory-access in

fix received length check in big packets","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio-net: fix received length check in big packets\n\nSince commit 4959aebba8c0 (\"virtio-net: use mtu size as buffer length\nfor big packets\"), when guest gso is off, the allocated size for big\npackets is not MAX_SKB_FRAGS * PAGE_SIZE anymore but depends on\nnegotiated MTU. The number of allocated frags for big packets is stored\nin vi->big_packets_num_skbfrags.\n\nBecause the host announced buffer length can be malicious (e.g. the host\nvhost_net driver's get_rx_bufs is modified to announce incorrect\nlength), we need a check in virtio_net receive path. Currently, the\ncheck is not adapted to the new change which can lead to NULL page\npointer dereference in the below while loop when receiving length that\nis larger than the allocated one.\n\nThis commit fixes the received length check corresponding to the new\nchange.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4959aebba8c06992abafa09d1e80965e0825af54"},{"fixed":"82f9028e83944a9eee5229cbc6fee9be1de8a62d"},{"fixed":"946dec89c41726b94d31147ec528b96af0be1b5a"},{"fixed":"82fe78065450d2d07f36a22e2b6b44955cf5ca5b"},{"fixed":"3e9d89f2ecd3636bd4cbdfd0b2dfdaf58f9882e2"},{"fixed":"0c716703965ffc5ef4311b65cb5d84a703784717"}]}],"versions":["v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9","v6.1.90","v6.1.91","v6.1.92","v6.1.93","v6.1.94","v6.1.95","v6.1.96","v6.1.97","v6.1.98","v6.1.99","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.6.1","v6.6.10","v6.6.100","v6.6.101","v6.6.102","v6.6.103","v6.6.104","v6.6.105","v6.6.106","v6.6.107","v6.6.108","v6.6.109","v6.6.11","v6.6.110","v6.6.111","v6.6.112","v6.6.113","v6.6.114","v6.6.115","v6.6.116","v6.6.12","v6.6.13","v6.6.14","v6.6.15","v6.6.16","v6.6.17","v6.6.18","v6.6.19","v6.6.2","v6.6.20","v6.6.21","v6.6.22","v6.6.23","v6.6.24","v6.6.25","v6.6.26","v6.6.27","v6.6.28","v6.6.29","v6.6.3","v6.6.30","v6.6.31","v6.6.32","v6.6.33","v6.6.34","v6.6.35","v6.6.36","v6.6.37","v6.6.38","v6.6.39","v6.6.4","v6.6.40","v6.6.41","v6.6.42","v6.6.43","v6.6.44","v6.6.45","v6.6.46","v6.6.47","v6.6.48","v6.6.49","v6.6.5","v6.6.50","v6.6.51","v6.6.52","v6.6.53","v6.6.54","v6.6.55","v6.6.56","v6.6.57","v6.6.58","v6.6.59","v6.6.6","v6.6.60","v6.6.61","v6.6.62","v6.6.63","v6.6.64","v6.6.65","v6.6.66","v6.6.67","v6.6.68","v6.6.69","v6.6.7","v6.6.70","v6.6.71","v6.6.72","v6.6.73","v6.6.74","v6.6.75","

So this results in an spi controller with an unbound parent\nand unmapped register space (because devm_ioremap_resource() is undone).\nSo using the remaining spi controller probably results in an oops.\n\nInstead unregister the controller unconditionally and only skip hardware\naccess and clk disable.\n\nAlso add a warning about resume failing and return zero unconditionally.\nThe latter has the only effect to suppress a less helpful error message by\nthe spi core.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4a2f83b7f78092a6d9e98fb5573d8f4b79c56336"},{"fixed":"f6974fb20499e3b6522daa7aec822aac11dfcf42"},{"fixed":"618770d4d8e40b7f8ed9eb5f210cd9164dfac47d"},{"fixed":"77806d7c9bebe40a8cdce2b8d30fbe6511745df8"},{"fixed":"9448bc1dee65f86c0fe64d9dea8b410af0586886"}]}],"versions":["v5.19","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.3","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.2.1","v6.2.10","v6.2.11","v6.2.12","v6.2.13","v6.2.14","v6.2.2","v6.2.3","v6.2.4","v6.2.5","v6.2.6","v6.2.7","v6.2.8","v6.2.9","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53758.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.28"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.2.15"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.3.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53758.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/618770d4d8e40b7f8ed9eb5f210cd9164dfac47d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/77806d7c9bebe40a8cdce2b8d30fbe6511745df8"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9448bc1dee65f86c0fe64d9dea8b410af0586886"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6974fb20499e3b6522daa7aec822aac11dfcf42"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53758.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53758"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53758.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:29:52.795204Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40301","published":"2025-12-08T00:46:24.863Z","modified":"2025-12-08T03:14:13.816452Z","summary":"Bluetooth: hci_event: validate skb length for unknown CC opcode","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: hci_event: validate skb length for unknown CC opcode\n\nIn hci_cmd_complete_evt(), if the command complete event has an unknown\nopcode, we assume the first byte of the remaining skb->data contains the\nreturn status.

increments the hidraw device reference\ncounter. The counter has no dedicated synchronization mechanism,\nresulting in a potential data race when concurrently opening a device.\n\nThe race is a regression introduced by commit 8590222e4b02 (\"HID:\nhidraw: Replace hidraw device table mutex with a rwsem\"). While\nminors_rwsem is intended to protect the hidraw_table itself, by instead\nacquiring the lock for writing, the reference counter is also protected.\nThis is symmetrical to hidraw_release().","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"8590222e4b021054a7167a4dd35b152a8ed7018e"},{"fixed":"879e79c3aead41b8aa2e91164354b30bd1c4ef3b"},{"fixed":"ff348eabd97577da974d3db7038857f28c61d2bd"},{"fixed":"05b47034e2488c2924e5c032e20a1979d012b5b5"},{"fixed":"944ee77dc6ec7b0afd8ec70ffc418b238c92f12b"}]}],"versions":["v5.16","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.10","v6.3.2","v6.3.3","v6.3.4","v6.3.5","v6.3.6","v6.3.7","v6.3.8","v6.3.9","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53759.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.17.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.37"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.11"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.4.0"},{"fixed":"6.4.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53759.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/05b47034e2488c2924e5c032e20a1979d012b5b5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/879e79c3aead41b8aa2e91164354b30bd1c4ef3b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/944ee77dc6ec7b0afd8ec70ffc418b238c92f12b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff348eabd97577da974d3db7038857f28c61d2bd"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53759.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53759"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53759.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:29:52.795270Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2022-50619","published":"2025-12-08T01:16:32.726Z","modified":"2025-12-08T03:11:18.852925Z","summary":"drm/amdkfd: Fix memory leak in kfd_mem_dmamap_userptr()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdkfd: Fix memory leak in kfd_mem_dmamap_userptr()\n\nIf the number of pages from the userptr BO differs from the SG BO then the\nallocated memory for the SG table doesn't get freed before returning\n-EINVAL, which may lead to a memory leak in some error paths.

Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nregmap-irq: Fix out-of-bounds access when allocating config buffers\n\nWhen allocating the 2D array for handling IRQ type registers in\nregmap_add_irq_chip_fwnode(), the intent is to allocate a matrix\nwith num_config_bases rows and num_config_regs columns.\n\nThis is currently handled by allocating a buffer to hold a pointer for\neach row (i.e. num_config_bases). After that, the logic attempts to\nallocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for\neach row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row\n(i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this\nallocation num_config_regs number of times.\n\nThis scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs\nis greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating\ncondition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register\nconfiguration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.\n\nAmit Pundir reported a crash that was occurring on his db845c device\ndue to memory corruption (see \"Closes\" tag for Amit's report).

If the server does not support a particular\n> attribute on the target file system, then it MUST NOT return the\n> attribute value and MUST NOT set the attribute bit in the result\n> bitmap. The server MUST return an error if it supports an\n> attribute on the target but cannot obtain its value. In that case,\n> no attribute values will be returned.\n\nFurther, RFC 9754 Section 5 states:\n\n> These new attributes are invalid to be used with GETATTR, VERIFY,\n> and NVERIFY, and they can only be used with CB_GETATTR and SETATTR\n> by a client holding an appropriate delegation.\n\nThus there does not appear to be a specific server response mandated\nby specification. Taking the guidance that querying these attributes\nvia GETATTR is \"invalid\", NFSD will return nfserr_inval, failing the\nrequest entirely.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"51c0d4f7e317d3cb4a3001e502bd8ca2d57f2a4b"},{"fixed":"d8f3f94dc950e7c62c96af432c26745885b0a18a"},{"fixed":"4f76435fd517981f01608678c06ad9718a86ee98"}]}],"versions":["v6.13","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40326.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.14.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40326.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4f76435fd517981f01608678c06ad9718a86ee98"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8f3f94dc950e7c62c96af432c26745885b0a18a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40326.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40326"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40326.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:29:53.825353Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53748","published":"2025-12-08T01:19:07.318Z","modified":"2025-12-08T02:34:33.964083Z","summary":"media: mediatek: vcodec: Fix potential array out-of-bounds in decoder queue_setup","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mediatek: vcodec: Fix potential array out-of-bounds in decoder queue_setup\n\nvariable *nplanes is provided by user via system call argument.

configuration since\ne35123d83ee3 (\"arm64: lto: Strengthen READ_ONCE() to acquire when\nCONFIG_LTO=y\"), READ_ONCE() may be promoted to a full atomic acquire\ninstruction which cannot be used on unaligned addresses.\n\nFix it by avoiding READ_ONCE() in read_instrumented_memory(), and simply\nforcing the compiler to do the required access by casting to the\nappropriate volatile type. In terms of generated code this currently\nonly affects architectures that do not use the default READ_ONCE()\nimplementation.\n\nThe only downside is that we are not guaranteed atomicity of the

Set fb_display[i]->mode to NULL when the mode is released","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbcon: Set fb_display[i]->mode to NULL when the mode is released\n\nRecently, we discovered the following issue through syzkaller:\n\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in fb_mode_is_equal+0x285/0x2f0\nRead of size 4 at addr ff11000001b3c69c by task

entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nBased on experimentation and analysis, during framebuffer unregistration,\nonly the memory of fb_info->modelist is freed, without setting the\ncorresponding fb_display[i]->mode to NULL for the freed modes. This leads\nto UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction\nsteps:\n1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module\n   to register a new device /dev/fb1;\n2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);\n3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);\n4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving\n   a wild pointer in fb_display[];\n5.

core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits\n\nTesting by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets a\nshift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit\nquantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but\nthere are buggy devices and some might have a report field with size\nset to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just because\nof that.\n\nInstead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonable\nresult instead of crashing when it is called with the number of bits\nset to 0 -- the same as what snto32()

usb-audio: Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer\n\nThe PCM stream data in USB-audio driver is transferred over USB URB\npacket buffers, and each packet size is determined dynamically.  The\npacket sizes are limited by some factors such as wMaxPacketSize USB\ndescriptor.  OTOH, in the current code, the actually used packet sizes\nare determined only by the rate and the PPS, which may be bigger than\nthe size limit above.  This results in a buffer overflow, as reported\nby syzbot.\n\nBasically when the limit is smaller than the calculated packet size,\nit implies that something is wrong, most likely a weird USB\ndescriptor.  So the best option would be just to return an error at\nthe parameter setup time before doing any further operations.\n\nThis patch introduces such a sanity check, and returns -EINVAL when\nthe packet size is greater than maxpacksize.  The comparison with\nep->packsize[1] alone should suffice since it's always equal or\ngreater than

usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd\n\nIn snd_usb_create_streams(), for UAC version 3 devices, the Interface\nAssociation Descriptor (IAD) is retrieved via usb_ifnum_to_if(). If this\ncall fails, a fallback routine attempts to obtain the IAD from the next\ninterface and sets a BADD profile. However, snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd()\nassumes that the IAD retrieved from usb_ifnum_to_if() is always valid,\nwithout performing a NULL check. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference when usb_ifnum_to_if() fails to find the interface descriptor.\n\nThis patch adds a NULL pointer check after calling usb_ifnum_to_if() in\nsnd_usb_mixer_controls_badd() to prevent the dereference.\n\nThis issue was discovered by syzkaller, which triggered the bug by sending\na crafted USB device

rb_erase(), but not set the node\nto EMPTY, which may result in uaf access.  We should use RB_CLEAR_NODE()\nset the erased node to EMPTY, then pde_subdir_next() will return NULL to\navoid uaf access.\n\nWe found an uaf issue while using stress-ng testing, need to run testcase\ngetdent and tun in the same time.  The steps of the issue is as follows:\n\n1) use getdent to traverse dir /proc/pid/net/dev_snmp6/, and current\n   pde is tun3;\n\n2) in the [time windows] unregister netdevice tun3 and tun2, and erase\n   them from rbtree.  erase tun3 first, and then erase tun2.  the\n   pde(tun2) will be released to slab;\n\n3) continue to getdent process, then pde_subdir_next() will return\n   pde(tun2)

While the padding bytes are reamined\nuninitialized. nla_put() copies the entire structure into a\nnetlink message, these uninitialized bytes leaked to userspace.\n\nInitialize the structure with memset before assigning its fields\nto ensure all members and padding are cleared prior to beign copied.\n\nThis change silences the KMSAN report and prevents potential information\nleaks from the kernel memory.\n\nThis fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the\nbug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures no

The problem arises when a phy control response comes late.  After\n300 ms the pm8001_phy_control() function returns and the passed\nenable_completion stack address is no longer valid. Late phy control\nresponse invokes complete() on a dangling enable_completion pointer which\nleads to a kernel

Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established\n\nDuring connect(), acting on a signal/timeout by disconnecting an already\nestablished socket leads to several issues:\n\n1. connect() invoking vsock_transport_cancel_pkt() ->\n   virtio_transport_purge_skbs() may race with sendmsg() invoking\n   virtio_transport_get_credit(). This results in a permanently elevated\n   `vvs->bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.\n\n2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket\n   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap\n   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.\n\n3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -> SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a\n   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for\n   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a\n   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.\n\nDo not disconnect socket on signal/timeout.

video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()\n\nThe switch_brightness_work delayed work accesses device->brightness\nand device->backlight, freed by acpi_video_dev_unregister_backlight()\nduring device removal.\n\nIf the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight()\nfrees these resources, it causes a use-after-free when\nacpi_video_switch_brightness() dereferences device->brightness or\ndevice->backlight.\n\nFix this by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for each device's\nswitch_brightness_work in acpi_video_bus_remove_notify_handler()\nafter removing the notify handler that
