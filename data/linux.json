fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfuse: fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers\n\nI observed a hang when running generic/323 against a fuseblk server.\nThis test opens a file, initiates a lot of AIO writes to that file\ndescriptor, and closes the file descriptor before the writes complete.\nUnsurprisingly, the AIO exerciser threads are mostly stuck waiting for\nresponses from the fuseblk server:\n\n# cat /proc/372265/task/372313/stack\n[<0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]\n[<0>] __fuse_simple_request+0xd3/0x2b0 [fuse]\n[<0>] fuse_do_getattr+0xfc/0x1f0 [fuse]\n[<0>] fuse_file_read_iter+0xbe/0x1c0 [fuse]\n[<0>] aio_read+0x130/0x1e0\n[<0>] io_submit_one+0x542/0x860\n[<0>] __x64_sys_io_submit+0x98/0x1a0\n[<0>] do_syscall_64+0x37/0xf0\n[<0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nBut the /weird/ part is that the fuseblk server threads are waiting for\nresponses from itself:\n\n# cat /proc/372210/task/372232/stack\n[<0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]\n[<0>] __fuse_simple_request+0xd3/0x2b0 [fuse]\n[<0>] fuse_file_put+0x9a/0xd0 [fuse]\n[<0>] fuse_release+0x36/0x50 [fuse]\n[<0>] __fput+0xec/0x2b0\n[<0>] task_work_run+0x55/0x90\n[<0>] syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0xe9/0x100\n[<0>] do_syscall_64+0x43/0xf0\n[<0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nThe fuseblk server is fuse2fs so there's nothing all that exciting in\nthe server itself.  So why is the fuse server calling fuse_file_put?\nThe commit message for the fstest sheds some light on that:\n\n\"By closing the file descriptor before calling io_destroy, you pretty\nmuch guarantee that the last put on the ioctx will be done in interrupt\ncontext (during I/O completion).\n\nAha.  AIO fgets a new struct file from the fd when it queues the ioctx.\nThe completion of the FUSE_WRITE command from userspace causes the fuse\nserver to call the AIO completion function.  The completion puts the\nstruct file, queuing a delayed fput to the fuse server task.  When the\nfuse server task returns to userspace, it has to run the delayed fput,\nwhich in the case of a fuseblk server, it does synchronously.\n\nSending the FUSE_RELEASE command sychronously from fuse server threads\nis a bad idea because a client program can initiate enough simultaneous\nAIOs such that all the fuse server threads end up in delayed_fput, and\nnow there aren't any threads left to handle the queued fuse commands.\n\nFix this by only using asynchronous fputs when closing files, and leave\na comment explaining

HFS_SB(sb)->bitmap buffer is allocated in hfs_mdb_get():\n\nHFS_SB(sb)->bitmap = kmalloc(8192, GFP_KERNEL);\n\nFinally, it can trigger the reported issue because kmalloc()\ndoesn't clear the allocated memory. If allocated memory contains\nonly zeros, then everything will work pretty fine.\nBut if the allocated memory contains the \"garbage\", then\nit can affect the bitmap operations and it triggers\nthe reported issue.\n\nThis patch simply exchanges the kmalloc() on kzalloc()\nwith the goal to guarantee the correctness of bitmap operations.\nBecause, newly created allocation bitmap should have all\navailable blocks free.

ensure that memblock.current_limit is set when setting pfn limits","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnios2: ensure that memblock.current_limit is set when setting pfn limits\n\nOn nios2, with CONFIG_FLATMEM set, the kernel relies on\nmemblock_get_current_limit() to determine the limits of mem_map, in\nparticular for max_low_pfn.\nUnfortunately, memblock.current_limit is only default initialized to\nMEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ANYWHERE at this point of the bootup, potentially leading\nto situations where max_low_pfn can erroneously exceed the value of\nmax_pfn and, thus, the valid range of available DRAM.\n\nThis can in turn cause kernel-level paging failures, e.g.:\n\n[   76.900000] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 20303000\n[   76.900000] ea = c0080890, ra = c000462c, cause = 14\n[   76.900000] Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops\n[   76.900000] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops ]---\n\nThis patch fixes

Initialise scc_index in unix_add_edge().","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naf_unix: Initialise scc_index in unix_add_edge().\n\nQuang Le reported that the AF_UNIX GC could garbage-collect a\nreceive queue of an alive in-flight socket, with a nice repro.\n\nThe repro consists of three stages.\n\n  1)\n    1-a. Create a single cyclic reference with many sockets\n    1-b. close() all sockets\n    1-c. Trigger GC\n\n  2)\n    2-a. Pass sk-A to an embryo sk-B\n    2-b. Pass sk-X to sk-X\n    2-c. Trigger GC\n\n  3)\n    3-a. accept() the embryo sk-B\n    3-b. Pass sk-B to sk-C\n    3-c. close() the in-flight sk-A\n    3-d. Trigger GC\n\nAs of 2-c, sk-A and sk-X are linked to unix_unvisited_vertices,\nand unix_walk_scc() groups them into two different SCCs:\n\n  unix_sk(sk-A)->vertex->scc_index = 2 (UNIX_VERTEX_INDEX_START)\n  unix_sk(sk-X)->vertex->scc_index = 3\n\nOnce GC completes, unix_graph_grouped is set to true.\nAlso, unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is set to true due to sk-X's\ncyclic self-reference, which makes close() trigger GC.\n\nAt 3-b, unix_add_edge() allocates unix_sk(sk-B)->vertex and\nlinks it to unix_unvisited_vertices.\n\nunix_update_graph() is called at 3-a. and 3-b., but neither\nunix_graph_grouped nor unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is changed\nbecause both sk-B's listener and sk-C are not in-flight.\n\n3-c decrements sk-A's file refcnt to 1.\n\nSince unix_graph_grouped is true at 3-d, unix_walk_scc_fast()\nis finally called and iterates 3 sockets sk-A, sk-B, and sk-X:\n\n  sk-A -> sk-B (-> sk-C)\n  sk-X -> sk-X\n\nThis is totally fine.  All of them are not yet close()d and\nshould be grouped into different SCCs.\n\nHowever, unix_vertex_dead() misjudges that sk-A and sk-B are\nin the same SCC and sk-A is dead.\n\n  unix_sk(sk-A)->scc_index == unix_sk(sk-B)->scc_index <-- Wrong!\n  &&\n  sk-A's file refcnt == unix_sk(sk-A)->vertex->out_degree\n                                       ^-- 1 in-flight count for sk-B\n  -> sk-A is dead !?\n\nThe problem is that unix_add_edge() does not initialise scc_index.\n\nStage 1) is used for heap spraying, making a newly allocated\nvertex have vertex->scc_index == 2 (UNIX_VERTEX_INDEX_START)\nset by unix_walk_scc() at 1-c.\n\nLet's track the max SCC index from the previous unix_walk_scc()\ncall and assign the max + 1 to a new vertex's scc_index.\n\nThis way, we can continue to avoid Tarjan's algorithm while\npreventing

fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()\n\nSyzbot reported a potential lock inversion deadlock between\nvsock_register_mutex and sk_lock-AF_VSOCK when vsock_linger() is called.\n\nThe issue was introduced by commit 687aa0c5581b (\"vsock: Fix\ntransport_* TOCTOU\") which added vsock_register_mutex locking in\nvsock_assign_transport() around the transport->release() call, that can\ncall vsock_linger(). vsock_assign_transport() can be called with sk_lock\nheld. vsock_linger() calls sk_wait_event() that temporarily releases and\nre-acquires sk_lock. During this window, if another thread hold\nvsock_register_mutex while trying to acquire sk_lock, a circular\ndependency is created.\n\nFix this by releasing vsock_register_mutex before calling\ntransport->release() and vsock_deassign_transport(). This is safe\nbecause we don't need to hold vsock_register_mutex while releasing the\nold transport, and we ensure the new transport won't disappear by\nobtaining a module reference first via

Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established\n\nDuring connect(), acting on a signal/timeout by disconnecting an already\nestablished socket leads to several issues:\n\n1. connect() invoking vsock_transport_cancel_pkt() ->\n   virtio_transport_purge_skbs() may race with sendmsg() invoking\n   virtio_transport_get_credit(). This results in a permanently elevated\n   `vvs->bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.\n\n2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket\n   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap\n   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.\n\n3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -> SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a\n   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for\n   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a\n   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.\n\nDo not disconnect socket on signal/timeout.

usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmost: usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect\n\nhdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which eventually\nunregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface->dev).\nIf that drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev()\nimmediately while hdm_disconnect() is still executing.\n\nThe old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in\nhdm_disconnect() and then performed additional put_device() calls.\nDepending on refcount order, this could lead to use-after-free or\ndouble-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also\nperformed puts).\n\nFix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(),\nso they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by\ndropping the extra put_device() calls in hdm_disconnect() that are\nredundant after

guard against EA inode refcount underflow in xattr update","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: guard against EA inode refcount underflow in xattr update\n\nsyzkaller found a path where ext4_xattr_inode_update_ref() reads an EA\ninode refcount that is already <= 0 and then applies ref_change (often\n-1). That lets the refcount underflow and we proceed with a bogus value,\ntriggering errors like:\n\n  EXT4-fs error: EA inode <n> ref underflow: ref_count=-1 ref_change=-1\n  EXT4-fs warning: ea_inode dec ref err=-117\n\nMake the invariant explicit: if the current refcount is non-positive,\ntreat this as on-disk corruption, emit ext4_error_inode(), and fail the\noperation with -EFSCORRUPTED instead of updating the refcount. Delete the\nWARN_ONCE() as negative refcounts are now impossible; keep error reporting\nin ext4_error_inode().\n\nThis prevents the underflow and the follow-on orphan/cleanup

(since\nv2.6.22-527-g7307de80510a) and calls fiemap_fill_next_extent() to read the\nextent list of this running mmap executable.  The user supplied buffer to\nhold the fiemap information page faults calling ocfs2_page_mkwrite() which\nwill take a write lock (since v2.6.27-38-g00dc417fa3e7) of the same\nsemaphore.  This recursive semaphore will hold filesystem locks and causes\na hang of the fileystem.\n\nThe ip_alloc_sem protects the inode extent list and size.  Release the\nread semphore before calling fiemap_fill_next_extent() in ocfs2_fiemap()\nand ocfs2_fiemap_inline().

rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndevlink: rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy\n\nThe function devl_rate_nodes_destroy is documented to \"Unset parent for\nall rate objects\". However, it was only calling the driver-specific\n`rate_leaf_parent_set` or `rate_node_parent_set` ops and decrementing\nthe parent's refcount, without actually setting the\n`devlink_rate->parent` pointer to NULL.\n\nThis leaves a dangling pointer in the `devlink_rate` struct, which cause\nrefcount error in netdevsim[1] and mlx5[2]. In addition, this is\ninconsistent with the behavior of `devlink_nl_rate_parent_node_set`,\nwhere the parent pointer is correctly cleared.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by explicitly setting `devlink_rate->parent`\nto NULL after notifying the driver, thus fulfilling the function's\ndocumented behavior for all rate objects.\n\n[1]\nrepro steps:\necho 1 >

This\nis for reading and writing page table accessed bits.

mlx5: Clean up only new IRQ glue on request_irq() failure","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Clean up only new IRQ glue on request_irq() failure\n\nThe mlx5_irq_alloc() function can inadvertently free the entire rmap\nand end up in a crash[1] when the other threads tries to access this,\nwhen request_irq() fails due to exhausted IRQ vectors. This commit\nmodifies the cleanup to remove only the specific IRQ mapping that was\njust added.\n\nThis prevents removal of other valid mappings and ensures precise\ncleanup of the failed IRQ allocation's associated glue object.\n\nNote: This error is observed when both fwctl and rds configs are enabled.\n\n[1]\nmlx5_core 0000:05:00.0: Successfully registered panic handler for port

Fix kernel panic on partial unmap of a GPU VA region","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panthor: Fix kernel panic on partial unmap of a GPU VA region\n\nThis commit address a kernel panic issue that can happen if Userspace\ntries to partially unmap a GPU virtual region (aka drm_gpuva).\nThe VM_BIND interface allows partial unmapping of a BO.\n\nPanthor driver pre-allocates memory for the new drm_gpuva structures\nthat would be needed for the map/unmap operation, done using drm_gpuvm\nlayer. It expected that only one new drm_gpuva would be needed on umap\nbut a partial unmap can require 2 new drm_gpuva and that's why it\nended up doing a NULL pointer dereference causing a kernel panic.\n\nFollowing dump was seen when partial unmap was exercised.\n Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000078\n Mem abort info:\n   ESR =

correct.  xfs_ifork::if_bytes is the size of the xfs_ifork::if_data\nbuffer.  if_bytes can be smaller than the data fork size because:\n\n(a) the forkoff code tries to keep the data area as large as possible\n(b) for symbolic links, if_bytes is the ondisk file size + 1\n(c) forkoff is always a multiple of 8.\n\nCase in point: for a single-byte symlink target, forkoff will be\n8 but the buffer will only be 2 bytes long.\n\nIn other words, the logic here is wrong and we walk off the end of the\nincore buffer.  Fix that.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2651923d8d8db00a57665822f017fa7c76758044"},{"fixed":"7c2d68e091584149fe89bcbaf9b99b3162d46ee7"},{"fixed":"81a8685cac4bf081c93a7df591644f4f80240bb9"},{"fixed":"678e1cc2f482e0985a0613ab4a5bf89c497e5acc"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.9","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40246.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.60"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40246.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/678e1cc2f482e0985a0613ab4a5bf89c497e5acc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7c2d68e091584149fe89bcbaf9b99b3162d46ee7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81a8685cac4bf081c93a7df591644f4f80240bb9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40246.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40246"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40246.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-07T01:13:31.447914Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-38715","published":"2025-09-04T15:33:09.954Z","modified":"2025-12-05T12:32:42.446135Z","related":["MGASA-2025-0234","MGASA-2025-0235","SUSE-SU-2025:3751-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4057-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4132-1"],"summary":"hfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds in hfs_bnode_read()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds in hfs_bnode_read()\n\nThis patch introduces is_bnode_offset_valid() method that checks\nthe requested offset value.

memory error injection on a THP (Transparent Huge Page)\nmapped to userspace on an x86 server, the kernel panics with the following\ntrace.  The expected behavior is to terminate the affected process instead\nof panicking the kernel, as the x86 Machine Check code can recover from an\nin-userspace #MC.\n\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 3: bd80000000070134\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffff8372f8bc> {memchr_inv+0x4c/0xf0}\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC afff7bbff88a ADDR 1d301b000 MISC 80 PPIN 1e741e77539027db\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:d06d0 TIME 1758093249 SOCKET 0 APIC 0 microcode 80000320\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel\n  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine check\n\nThe root cause of this panic is that handling a memory failure triggered\nby an in-userspace #MC necessitates splitting the THP.  The splitting\nprocess employs a mechanism, implemented in\ntry_to_map_unused_to_zeropage(), which reads the pages in the THP to\nidentify zero-filled pages.  However, reading the pages in the THP results\nin a second in-kernel #MC, occurring before the initial memory_failure()\ncompletes, ultimately leading to a kernel panic.

serial: sh-sci: fix RSCI FIFO overrun handling","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: serial: sh-sci: fix RSCI FIFO overrun handling\n\nThe receive error handling code is shared between RSCI and all other\nSCIF port types, but the RSCI overrun_reg is specified as a memory\noffset, while for other SCIF types it is an enum value used to index\ninto the sci_port_params->regs array, as mentioned above the\nsci_serial_in() function.\n\nFor RSCI, the overrun_reg is CSR (0x48), causing the sci_getreg() call\ninside the sci_handle_fifo_overrun() function to index outside the\nbounds of the regs array, which currently has a size of 20, as specified\nby SCI_NR_REGS.\n\nBecause of this, we end up accessing memory outside of RSCI's\nrsci_port_params structure, which, when interpreted as a plat_sci_reg,\nhappens to have a non-zero size, causing the following WARN when\nsci_serial_in() is called, as the accidental size does not match the\nsupported register sizes.\n\nThe existence of the overrun_reg needs to be checked because\nSCIx_SH3_SCIF_REGTYPE has overrun_reg set to SCLSR, but SCLSR is not\npresent in the regs array.\n\nAvoid calling sci_getreg() for port types which don't use standard\nregister handling.\n\nUse the ops->read_reg() and ops->write_reg() functions to properly read\nand write registers for RSCI, and change the type of the status variable\nto accommodate the 32-bit CSR register.\n\nsci_getreg() and sci_serial_in() are also called with overrun_reg in the\nsci_mpxed_interrupt() interrupt handler, but that code path is not used\nfor RSCI, as it does not have a muxed interrupt.\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nInvalid register access\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at

xfrm_state_delete_tunnel at destroy time for states that were never added\n\nIn commit b441cf3f8c4b (\"xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x\"), I\nmissed the case where state creation fails between full\ninitialization (->init_state has been called) and being inserted on\nthe lists.\n\nIn this situation, ->init_state has been called, so for IPcomp\ntunnels, the fallback tunnel has been created and added onto the\nlists, but the user state never gets added, because we fail before\nthat. The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we\ndon't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up\nleaking the FB tunnel.\n\nThere are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in\nboth net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,\nxfrm_state_migrate). A \"proper\" rollback of the init_state work would\nprobably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets\nmore complicated as multiple states may be involved.\n\nAt some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call\nxfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states\nwill have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,\nwhich solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)\naimed at. All states (including FB tunnels) will be removed from the\nlists once xfrm_state_fini has called flush_work(&xfrm_state_gc_work).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b441cf3f8c4b8576639d20c8eb4aa32917602ecd"},{"fixed":"d6fe5c740c573af10943b8353992e1325cdb2715"},{"fixed":"10deb69864840ccf96b00ac2ab3a2055c0c04721"}]}],"versions":["v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40256.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40256.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10deb69864840ccf96b00ac2ab3a2055c0c04721"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6fe5c740c573af10943b8353992e1325cdb2715"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40256.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40256"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40256.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-07T01:13:31.449140Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40224","published":"2025-12-04T15:31:16.193Z","modified":"2025-12-05T12:29:44.113548Z","summary":"hwmon: (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing NULL check after devm_kzalloc()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing NULL check after devm_kzalloc()\n\nThe driver allocates memory for sensor data using devm_kzalloc(), but\ndid not check if the allocation succeeded.

detect invalid INLINE_DATA + EXTENTS flag combination","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: detect invalid INLINE_DATA + EXTENTS flag combination\n\nsyzbot reported a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() when opening a verity\nfile on a corrupted ext4 filesystem mounted without a journal.\n\nThe issue is that the filesystem has an inode with both the INLINE_DATA\nand EXTENTS flags set:\n\n    EXT4-fs error (device loop0): ext4_cache_extents:545: inode #15:\n    comm syz.0.17: corrupted extent tree: lblk 0 < prev 66\n\nInvestigation revealed that the inode has both flags set:\n    DEBUG: inode 15 - flag=1, i_inline_off=164, has_inline=1, extents_flag=1\n\nThis is an invalid combination since an inode should have either:\n- INLINE_DATA: data stored directly in the inode\n- EXTENTS: data stored in extent-mapped blocks\n\nHaving both flags causes ext4_has_inline_data() to return true, skipping\nextent tree validation in __ext4_iget(). The unvalidated out-of-order\nextents then trigger a BUG_ON in ext4_es_cache_extent() due to integer\nunderflow when calculating hole sizes.\n\nFix this by detecting this invalid flag combination early in ext4_iget()\nand rejecting the corrupted

trigger stack-out-of-bounds\nIn the mpage_read_folio() function, the stack variable 'map_bh' is\npassed to ntfs_get_block_vbo(). Once unlock_buffer() unlocks and\nwait_on_buffer() returns to continue processing, the stack variable\nis likely to be reclaimed. Consequently, during the end_buffer_read_sync()\nprocess, calling put_bh() may result in stack overrun.\n\nIf the bh is not allocated on the stack, it belongs to a folio.  Freeing\na buffer head which belongs to a folio is done by drop_buffers() which\nwill fail to free buffers which are still locked.  So it is safe to call\nput_bh() before

to stale coupling data\n\nFailing to reset coupling_desc.n_coupled after freeing coupled_rdevs can\nlead to NULL pointer dereference when regulators are accessed post-unbind.\n\nThis can happen during runtime PM or other regulator operations that rely\non coupling metadata.\n\nFor example, on ridesx4, unbinding the 'reg-dummy' platform device triggers\na panic in regulator_lock_recursive() due to stale coupling state.\n\nEnsure n_coupled is set to 0 to prevent access to invalid

null-ptr-deref in dib7090p_rw_on_apb()\n\nIn dib7090p_rw_on_apb, msg is controlled by user. When msg[0].buf is null and\nmsg[0].len is zero, former checks on msg[0].buf would be passed. If accessing\nmsg[0].buf[2] without sanity check, null pointer deref would happen.

Prevent file descriptor table allocations exceeding INT_MAX","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs: Prevent file descriptor table allocations exceeding INT_MAX\n\nWhen sysctl_nr_open is set to a very high value (for example, 1073741816\nas set by systemd), processes attempting to use file descriptors near\nthe limit can trigger massive memory allocation attempts that exceed\nINT_MAX, resulting in a WARNING in mm/slub.c:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 44 at mm/slub.c:5027 __kvmalloc_node_noprof+0x21a/0x288\n\nThis happens because kvmalloc_array() and kvmalloc() check if the\nrequested size exceeds INT_MAX and emit a warning when the allocation is\nnot flagged with __GFP_NOWARN.\n\nSpecifically, when nr_open is set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8) and a\nprocess calls dup2(oldfd, 1073741880), the kernel attempts to allocate:\n- File descriptor array: 1073741880 * 8 bytes = 8,589,935,040 bytes\n- Multiple bitmaps: ~400MB\n- Total allocation size: > 8GB (exceeding INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647)\n\nReproducer:\n1. Set /proc/sys/fs/nr_open to 1073741816:\n   # echo 1073741816 > /proc/sys/fs/nr_open\n\n2. Run a program that uses a high file descriptor:\n   #include <unistd.h>\n   #include <sys/resource.h>\n\n   int main() {\n       struct rlimit rlim = {1073741824, 1073741824};\n       setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rlim);\n       dup2(2, 1073741880);  // Triggers the warning\n       return 0;\n   }\n\n3. Observe WARNING in dmesg at mm/slub.c:5027\n\nsystemd commit a8b627a introduced automatic bumping of fs.nr_open to the\nmaximum possible value. The rationale was that systems with memory\ncontrol groups (memcg) no longer need separate file descriptor limits\nsince memory is properly accounted. However, this change overlooked\nthat:\n\n1. The kernel's allocation functions still enforce INT_MAX as a maximum\n   size regardless of memcg accounting\n2. Programs and tests that legitimately test file descriptor limits can\n   inadvertently trigger massive allocations\n3. The resulting allocations (>8GB) are impractical and will always fail\n\nsystemd's algorithm starts with INT_MAX and keeps halving the value\nuntil the kernel accepts it. On most systems, this results in nr_open\nbeing set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8), which is just under 1GB of file\ndescriptors.\n\nWhile processes rarely use file descriptors near this limit in normal\noperation, certain selftests (like\ntools/testing/selftests/core/unshare_test.c) and programs that test file\ndescriptor limits can trigger this issue.\n\nFix this by adding a check in alloc_fdtable() to ensure the requested\nallocation size does not exceed INT_MAX. This causes the operation to\nfail with -EMFILE instead of triggering a kernel warning and avoids the\nimpractical >8GB memory allocation

Fix potential warning in trace_printk_seq during ftrace_dump","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nftrace: Fix potential warning in trace_printk_seq during ftrace_dump\n\nWhen calling ftrace_dump_one() concurrently with reading trace_pipe,\na WARN_ON_ONCE() in trace_printk_seq() can be triggered due to a race\ncondition.\n\nThe issue occurs because:\n\nCPU0 (ftrace_dump)                              CPU1 (reader)\necho z > /proc/sysrq-trigger\n\n!trace_empty(&iter)\ntrace_iterator_reset(&iter) <- len = size = 0\n                                                cat /sys/kernel/tracing/trace_pipe\ntrace_find_next_entry_inc(&iter)\n  __find_next_entry\n    ring_buffer_empty_cpu <- all empty\n  return NULL\n\ntrace_printk_seq(&iter.seq)\n  WARN_ON_ONCE(s->seq.len >= s->seq.size)\n\nIn the context between trace_empty() and trace_find_next_entry_inc()\nduring ftrace_dump, the ring buffer data was consumed by other readers.\nThis caused trace_find_next_entry_inc to return NULL, failing to populate\n`iter.seq`. At this point, due to the prior trace_iterator_reset, both\n`iter.seq.len` and `iter.seq.size` were set to 0.

Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree\n\nnetem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem\nresides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a\nsoft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].\nEnsure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other\nnetems.\n\nPrevious approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:\n\n1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered\ntoo specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would\nbe a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future\nDOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].\n\n2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a\nper cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its\nchild, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a\nnetem.\n\n3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb\nto handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement\nin duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal\nnotes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this\nsafeguard.\n\n4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral\npath contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a\npacket to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem\nduplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a\nduplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/8DuRWwfqjoRDLDmBMlIfbrsZg9Gx50DHJc1ilxsEBNe2D6NMoigR_eIRIG0LOjMc3r10nUUZtArXx4oZBIdUfZQrwjcQhdinnMis_0G7VEk=@willsroot.io/\n[2]

fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()\n\nWhen packet_set_ring() releases po->bind_lock, another thread can\nrun packet_notifier() and process an NETDEV_UP event.\n\nThis race and the fix are both similar to that of commit 15fe076edea7\n(\"net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()\").\n\nThere too the packet_notifier NETDEV_UP event managed to run while a\npo->bind_lock critical section had to be temporarily released.

avoid potential out-of-bounds in btrfs_encode_fh()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: avoid potential out-of-bounds in btrfs_encode_fh()\n\nThe function btrfs_encode_fh() does not properly account for the three\ncases it handles.\n\nBefore writing to the file handle (fh), the function only returns to the\nuser BTRFS_FID_SIZE_NON_CONNECTABLE (5 dwords, 20 bytes) or\nBTRFS_FID_SIZE_CONNECTABLE (8 dwords, 32 bytes).\n\nHowever, when a parent exists and the root ID of the parent and the\ninode are different, the function writes BTRFS_FID_SIZE_CONNECTABLE_ROOT\n(10 dwords, 40 bytes).\n\nIf *max_len is not large enough, this write goes out of bounds because\nBTRFS_FID_SIZE_CONNECTABLE_ROOT is greater than\nBTRFS_FID_SIZE_CONNECTABLE originally returned.\n\nThis results in an 8-byte out-of-bounds write at\nfid->parent_root_objectid = parent_root_id.\n\nA previous attempt to fix this issue was made but was lost.\n\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/4CADAEEC020000780001B32C@vpn.id2.novell.com/\n\nAlthough this issue does not seem to be easily triggerable, it is a\npotential memory corruption bug that should be fixed. This patch\nresolves the issue by ensuring the function returns the appropriate size\nfor all three cases and validates that *max_len is large enough before\nwriting any

avoid accessing metadata when pointer is invalid in object_err()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/slub: avoid accessing metadata when pointer is invalid in object_err()\n\nobject_err() reports details of an object for further debugging, such as\nthe freelist pointer, redzone, etc. However, if the pointer is invalid,\nattempting to access object metadata can lead to a crash since it does\nnot point to a valid object.\n\nOne known path to the crash is when alloc_consistency_checks()\ndetermines the pointer to the allocated object is invalid because of a\nfreelist corruption, and calls object_err() to report it.

fix divide-by-zero in comedi_buf_munge()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: fix divide-by-zero in comedi_buf_munge()\n\nThe comedi_buf_munge() function performs a modulo operation\n`async->munge_chan %= async->cmd.chanlist_len` without first\nchecking if chanlist_len is zero. If a user program submits a command with\nchanlist_len set to zero, this causes a divide-by-zero error when the device\nprocesses data in the interrupt handler path.\n\nAdd a check for zero chanlist_len at the beginning of the\nfunction, similar to the existing checks for !map and\nCMDF_RAWDATA flag. When chanlist_len is zero, update\nmunge_count and return early, indicating the data was\nhandled without munging.\n\nThis prevents potential kernel panics from malformed user

target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow\n\nA buffer overflow arises from the usage of snprintf to write into the\nbuffer \"buf\" in target_lu_gp_members_show function located in\n/drivers/target/target_core_configfs.c. This buffer is allocated with\nsize LU_GROUP_NAME_BUF (256 bytes).\n\nsnprintf(...) formats multiple strings into buf with the HBA name\n(hba->hba_group.cg_item), a slash character, a devicename (dev->\ndev_group.cg_item) and a newline character, the total formatted string\nlength may exceed the buffer size of 256 bytes.\n\nSince snprintf() returns the total number of bytes that would have

Fix uninited ptr deref in block/scsi layout","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npNFS: Fix uninited ptr deref in block/scsi layout\n\nThe error occurs on the third attempt to encode extents. When function\next_tree_prepare_commit() reallocates a larger buffer to retry encoding\nextents, the \"layoutupdate_pages\" page array is initialized only after the\nretry loop. But ext_tree_free_commitdata() is called on every iteration\nand tries to put pages in the array, thus dereferencing uninitialized\npointers.\n\nAn additional problem is that there is no limit on the maximum possible\nbuffer_size. When there are too many extents, the client may create a\nlayoutcommit that is larger than the maximum possible RPC size accepted\nby the server.\n\nDuring testing, we observed two typical scenarios. First, one memory page\nfor extents is enough when we work with small files, append data to the\nend of the file, or preallocate extents before writing. But when we fill\na new large file without preallocating, the number of extents can be huge,\nand counting the number of written extents in ext_tree_encode_commit()\ndoes not help much. Since this number increases even more between\nunlocking and locking of ext_tree, the reallocated buffer may not be\nlarge enough again and

reported the splat below. [0]\n\nThis happens if we call ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) more than once.\n\nDuring the first call, clip_mkip() sets clip_push() to vcc->push(),\nand the second call copies it to clip_vcc->old_push().\n\nLater, when the socket is close()d, vcc_destroy_socket() passes\nNULL skb to clip_push(), which calls clip_vcc->old_push(),\ntriggering the infinite recursion.\n\nLet's prevent the second ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) by checking\nvcc->user_back, which is allocated by the first call as clip_vcc.\n\nNote also that we use lock_sock() to prevent racy calls.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: TASK

Protect ->defer_qs_iw_pending from data race","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrcu: Protect ->defer_qs_iw_pending from data race\n\nOn kernels built with CONFIG_IRQ_WORK=y, when rcu_read_unlock() is\ninvoked within an interrupts-disabled region of code [1], it will invoke\nrcu_read_unlock_special(), which uses an irq-work handler to force the\nsystem to notice when the RCU read-side critical section actually ends.\nThat end won't happen until interrupts are enabled at the soonest.\n\nIn some kernels, such as those booted with rcutree.use_softirq=y, the\nirq-work handler is used unconditionally.\n\nThe per-CPU rcu_data structure's ->defer_qs_iw_pending field is\nupdated by the irq-work handler and is both read and updated by\nrcu_read_unlock_special().  This resulted in the following KCSAN splat:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBUG: KCSAN: data-race in rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler / rcu_read_unlock_special\n\nread to 0xffff96b95f42d8d8 of 1 bytes by task 90 on cpu 8:\n rcu_read_unlock_special+0x175/0x260\n __rcu_read_unlock+0x92/0xa0\n rt_spin_unlock+0x9b/0xc0\n __local_bh_enable+0x10d/0x170\n __local_bh_enable_ip+0xfb/0x150\n rcu_do_batch+0x595/0xc40\n rcu_cpu_kthread+0x4e9/0x830\n smpboot_thread_fn+0x24d/0x3b0\n kthread+0x3bd/0x410\n ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nwrite to 0xffff96b95f42d8d8 of 1 bytes by task 88 on cpu 8:\n rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler+0x1e/0x30\n irq_work_single+0xaf/0x160\n run_irq_workd+0x91/0xc0\n smpboot_thread_fn+0x24d/0x3b0\n kthread+0x3bd/0x410\n ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nno locks held by irq_work/8/88.\nirq event stamp: 200272\nhardirqs last  enabled at (200272): [<ffffffffb0f56121>] finish_task_switch+0x131/0x320\nhardirqs last disabled at (200271): [<ffffffffb25c7859>] __schedule+0x129/0xd70\nsoftirqs last  enabled at (0): [<ffffffffb0ee093f>] copy_process+0x4df/0x1cc0\nsoftirqs last disabled at (0): [<0000000000000000>] 0x0\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is that irq-work handlers run with interrupts enabled, which\nmeans that rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() could be interrupted,\nand that interrupt handler might contain an RCU read-side critical\nsection, which might invoke rcu_read_unlock_special().  In the strict\nKCSAN mode of operation used by RCU, this constitutes a data race on\nthe ->defer_qs_iw_pending field.\n\nThis commit therefore disables interrupts across the portion of the\nrcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() that updates the ->defer_qs_iw_pending\nfield.  This suffices because this handler is not a fast

rose_rt_device_down()\n\nThere are two bugs in rose_rt_device_down() that can cause\nuse-after-free:\n\n1. The loop bound `t->count` is modified within the loop, which can\n   cause the loop to terminate early and miss some entries.\n\n2. When removing an entry from the neighbour array, the subsequent entries\n   are moved up to fill the gap, but the loop index `i` is still\n   incremented, causing the next entry to be skipped.\n\nFor example, if a node has three neighbours (A, A, B) with count=3 and A\nis being removed, the second A is not checked.\n\n    i=0: (A, A, B) -> (A, B) with count=2\n          ^ checked\n    i=1: (A, B)    -> (A, B) with count=2\n             ^ checked (B, not A!)\n    i=2: (doesn't occur because i < count is false)\n\nThis leaves the second A in the array with count=2, but the rose_neigh\nstructure has been freed. Code that accesses these entries assumes that\nthe first `count` entries are valid pointers, causing a use-after-free\nwhen it accesses the dangling pointer.\n\nFix both issues by iterating over the array in reverse order with a fixed\nloop bound.

Return NULL when htb_lookup_leaf encounters an empty rbtree","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Return NULL when htb_lookup_leaf encounters an empty rbtree\n\nhtb_lookup_leaf has a BUG_ON that can trigger with the following:\n\ntc qdisc del dev lo root\ntc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: htb default 1\ntc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 64bit\ntc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: netem\ntc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: blackhole\nping -I lo -c1 -W0.001 127.0.0.1\n\nThe root cause is the following:\n\n1. htb_dequeue calls htb_dequeue_tree which calls the dequeue handler on\n   the selected leaf qdisc\n2. netem_dequeue calls enqueue on the child qdisc\n3. blackhole_enqueue drops the packet and returns a value that is not\n   just NET_XMIT_SUCCESS\n4. Because of this, netem_dequeue calls qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, and\n   since qlen is now 0, it calls htb_qlen_notify -> htb_deactivate ->\n   htb_deactiviate_prios -> htb_remove_class_from_row -> htb_safe_rb_erase\n5. As this is the only class in the selected hprio rbtree,\n   __rb_change_child in __rb_erase_augmented sets the rb_root pointer to\n   NULL\n6. Because blackhole_dequeue returns NULL, netem_dequeue returns NULL,\n   which causes htb_dequeue_tree to call htb_lookup_leaf with the same\n   hprio rbtree, and fail the BUG_ON\n\nThe function graph for this scenario is shown here:\n 0)               |  htb_enqueue() {\n 0) + 13.635 us   |    netem_enqueue();\n 0)   4.719 us    |    htb_activate_prios();\n 0) # 2249.199 us |  }\n 0)

ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump\n\nThere is a reference count leak in ctnetlink_dump_table():\n      if (res < 0) {\n                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general); // HERE\n                cb->args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;\n                ...\n\nWhile its very unlikely, its possible that ct == last.\nIf this happens, then the refcount of ct was already incremented.\nThis 2nd increment is never undone.\n\nThis prevents the conntrack object from being released, which in turn\nkeeps prevents cnet->count from dropping back to 0.\n\nThis will then block the netns dismantle (or conntrack rmmod) as\nnf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list() will wait forever.\n\nThis can be reproduced by running conntrack_resize.sh selftest in a loop.\nIt takes ~20 minutes for me on a preemptible kernel on average before\nI see a runaway kworker spinning in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list.\n\nOne fix would to change this to:\n        if (res < 0) {\n\t\tif (ct != last)\n\t                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general);\n\nBut this reference counting isn't needed in the first place.\nWe can just store a cookie value instead.\n\nA followup patch will do the same for ctnetlink_exp_dump_table,\nit looks to me as if this has the same problem and like\nctnetlink_dump_table, we only need a 'skip hint', not the actual\nobject so we can apply the same cookie strategy there as

allocates struct clip_vcc and set it to\nvcc->user_back.\n\nThe code assumes that vcc_destroy_socket() passes NULL skb\nto vcc->push() when the socket is close()d, and then clip_push()\nfrees clip_vcc.\n\nHowever, ioctl(ATMARPD_CTRL) sets NULL to vcc->push() in\natm_init_atmarp(), resulting in memory leak.\n\nLet's serialise two ioctl() by lock_sock() and check vcc->push()\nin atm_init_atmarp() to prevent
