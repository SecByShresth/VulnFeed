core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits\n\nTesting by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets a\nshift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit\nquantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but\nthere are buggy devices and some might have a report field with size\nset to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just because\nof that.\n\nInstead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonable\nresult instead of crashing when it is called with the number of bits\nset to 0 -- the same as what snto32()

usb-audio: Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential overflow of PCM transfer buffer\n\nThe PCM stream data in USB-audio driver is transferred over USB URB\npacket buffers, and each packet size is determined dynamically.  The\npacket sizes are limited by some factors such as wMaxPacketSize USB\ndescriptor.  OTOH, in the current code, the actually used packet sizes\nare determined only by the rate and the PPS, which may be bigger than\nthe size limit above.  This results in a buffer overflow, as reported\nby syzbot.\n\nBasically when the limit is smaller than the calculated packet size,\nit implies that something is wrong, most likely a weird USB\ndescriptor.  So the best option would be just to return an error at\nthe parameter setup time before doing any further operations.\n\nThis patch introduces such a sanity check, and returns -EINVAL when\nthe packet size is greater than maxpacksize.  The comparison with\nep->packsize[1] alone should suffice since it's always equal or\ngreater than

usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix NULL pointer dereference in snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd\n\nIn snd_usb_create_streams(), for UAC version 3 devices, the Interface\nAssociation Descriptor (IAD) is retrieved via usb_ifnum_to_if(). If this\ncall fails, a fallback routine attempts to obtain the IAD from the next\ninterface and sets a BADD profile. However, snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd()\nassumes that the IAD retrieved from usb_ifnum_to_if() is always valid,\nwithout performing a NULL check. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference when usb_ifnum_to_if() fails to find the interface descriptor.\n\nThis patch adds a NULL pointer check after calling usb_ifnum_to_if() in\nsnd_usb_mixer_controls_badd() to prevent the dereference.\n\nThis issue was discovered by syzkaller, which triggered the bug by sending\na crafted USB device

rb_erase(), but not set the node\nto EMPTY, which may result in uaf access.  We should use RB_CLEAR_NODE()\nset the erased node to EMPTY, then pde_subdir_next() will return NULL to\navoid uaf access.\n\nWe found an uaf issue while using stress-ng testing, need to run testcase\ngetdent and tun in the same time.  The steps of the issue is as follows:\n\n1) use getdent to traverse dir /proc/pid/net/dev_snmp6/, and current\n   pde is tun3;\n\n2) in the [time windows] unregister netdevice tun3 and tun2, and erase\n   them from rbtree.  erase tun3 first, and then erase tun2.  the\n   pde(tun2) will be released to slab;\n\n3) continue to getdent process, then pde_subdir_next() will return\n   pde(tun2)

While the padding bytes are reamined\nuninitialized. nla_put() copies the entire structure into a\nnetlink message, these uninitialized bytes leaked to userspace.\n\nInitialize the structure with memset before assigning its fields\nto ensure all members and padding are cleared prior to beign copied.\n\nThis change silences the KMSAN report and prevents potential information\nleaks from the kernel memory.\n\nThis fix has been tested and validated by syzbot. This patch closes the\nbug reported at the following syzkaller link and ensures no

The problem arises when a phy control response comes late.  After\n300 ms the pm8001_phy_control() function returns and the passed\nenable_completion stack address is no longer valid. Late phy control\nresponse invokes complete() on a dangling enable_completion pointer which\nleads to a kernel

Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: Ignore signal/timeout on connect() if already established\n\nDuring connect(), acting on a signal/timeout by disconnecting an already\nestablished socket leads to several issues:\n\n1. connect() invoking vsock_transport_cancel_pkt() ->\n   virtio_transport_purge_skbs() may race with sendmsg() invoking\n   virtio_transport_get_credit(). This results in a permanently elevated\n   `vvs->bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.\n\n2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket\n   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap\n   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.\n\n3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -> SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a\n   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for\n   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a\n   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.\n\nDo not disconnect socket on signal/timeout.

video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: video: Fix use-after-free in acpi_video_switch_brightness()\n\nThe switch_brightness_work delayed work accesses device->brightness\nand device->backlight, freed by acpi_video_dev_unregister_backlight()\nduring device removal.\n\nIf the work executes after acpi_video_bus_unregister_backlight()\nfrees these resources, it causes a use-after-free when\nacpi_video_switch_brightness() dereferences device->brightness or\ndevice->backlight.\n\nFix this by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync() for each device's\nswitch_brightness_work in acpi_video_bus_remove_notify_handler()\nafter removing the notify handler that

openvswitch: remove never-working support for setting nsh fields","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: openvswitch: remove never-working support for setting nsh fields\n\nThe validation of the set(nsh(...)) action is completely wrong.\nIt runs through the nsh_key_put_from_nlattr() function that is the\nsame function that validates NSH keys for the flow match and the\npush_nsh() action.  However, the set(nsh(...)) has a very different\nmemory layout.  Nested attributes in there are doubled in size in\ncase of the masked set().  That makes proper validation impossible.\n\nThere is also confusion in the code between the 'masked' flag, that\nsays that the nested attributes are doubled in size containing both\nthe value and the mask, and the 'is_mask' that says that the value\nwe're parsing is the mask.  This is causing kernel crash on trying to\nwrite into mask part of the match with SW_FLOW_KEY_PUT() during\nvalidation, while validate_nsh() doesn't allocate any memory for it:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 1c2383067 P4D 1c2383067 PUD 20b703067 PMD 0\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n  CPU: 8 UID: 0 Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.17.0-rc4+ #107 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n  RIP: 0010:nsh_key_put_from_nlattr+0x19d/0x610 [openvswitch]\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   validate_nsh+0x60/0x90 [openvswitch]\n   validate_set.constprop.0+0x270/0x3c0 [openvswitch]\n   __ovs_nla_copy_actions+0x477/0x860 [openvswitch]\n   ovs_nla_copy_actions+0x8d/0x100 [openvswitch]\n   ovs_packet_cmd_execute+0x1cc/0x310 [openvswitch]\n   genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0xdb/0x130\n   genl_family_rcv_msg+0x14b/0x220\n   genl_rcv_msg+0x47/0xa0\n   netlink_rcv_skb+0x53/0x100\n   genl_rcv+0x24/0x40\n   netlink_unicast+0x280/0x3b0\n   netlink_sendmsg+0x1f7/0x430\n   ____sys_sendmsg+0x36b/0x3a0\n   ___sys_sendmsg+0x87/0xd0\n   __sys_sendmsg+0x6d/0xd0\n   do_syscall_64+0x7b/0x2c0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nThe third issue with this process is that while trying to convert\nthe non-masked set into masked one, validate_set() copies and doubles\nthe size of the OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH as if it didn't have any nested\nattributes.  It should be copying each nested attribute and doubling\nthem in size independently.  And the process must be properly reversed\nduring the conversion back from masked to a non-masked variant during\nthe flow dump.\n\nIn the end, the only two outcomes of trying to use this action are\neither validation failure or a kernel crash.  And if somehow someone\nmanages to install a flow with such an action, it will most definitely\nnot do what it is supposed to, since all the keys and the masks are\nmixed up.\n\nFixing all the issues is a complex task as it requires re-writing\nmost of the validation code.\n\nGiven that and the fact that this functionality never worked since\nintroduction, let's just remove it altogether.

nfs4_free_ol_stateid()\n\nTypically copynotify stateid is freed either when parent's stateid\nis being close/freed or in nfsd4_laundromat if the stateid hasn't\nbeen used in a lease period.\n\nHowever, in case when the server got an OPEN (which created\na parent stateid), followed by a COPY_NOTIFY using that stateid,\nfollowed by a client reboot. New client instance while doing\nCREATE_SESSION would force expire previous state of this client.\nIt leads to the open state being freed thru release_openowner->\nnfs4_free_ol_stateid() and it finds that it still has copynotify\nstateid associated with it. We currently print a warning and is\ntriggerred\n\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 8858 at fs/nfsd/nfs4state.c:1550 nfs4_free_ol_stateid+0xb0/0x100 [nfsd]\n\nThis patch, instead, frees the associated copynotify stateid here.\n\nIf the parent stateid is freed (without freeing the copynotify\nstateids associated with it), it leads to the list corruption\nwhen laundromat ends up freeing the copynotify state later.\n\n[ 1626.839430] Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1]  SMP\n[ 1626.842828] Modules linked in: nfnetlink_queue nfnetlink_log bluetooth cfg80211 rpcrdma rdma_cm iw_cm ib_cm ib_core nfsd nfs_acl lockd grace nfs_localio ext4 crc16 mbcache jbd2 overlay uinput snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer qrtr rfkill vfat fat uvcvideo snd_hda_codec_generic videobuf2_vmalloc videobuf2_memops snd_hda_intel uvc snd_intel_dspcfg videobuf2_v4l2 videobuf2_common snd_hda_codec snd_hda_core videodev snd_hwdep snd_seq mc snd_seq_device snd_pcm snd_timer snd soundcore sg loop auth_rpcgss vsock_loopback vmw_vsock_virtio_transport_common vmw_vsock_vmci_transport vmw_vmci vsock xfs 8021q garp stp llc mrp nvme ghash_ce e1000e nvme_core sr_mod nvme_keyring nvme_auth cdrom vmwgfx drm_ttm_helper ttm sunrpc dm_mirror dm_region_hash dm_log iscsi_tcp libiscsi_tcp libiscsi scsi_transport_iscsi fuse dm_multipath dm_mod nfnetlink\n[ 1626.855594] CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 199 Comm: kworker/u24:33 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G    B   W           6.17.0-rc7+ #22 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n[ 1626.857075] Tainted: [B]=BAD_PAGE, [W]=WARN\n[ 1626.857573] Hardware name: VMware, Inc.

The same data is\nthen used later in the function, hence the UAF.\n\nFix by moving the accesses to btusb data to before the data is

Fix NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices\n\nPreviously, APU platforms (and other scenarios with uninitialized VRAM managers)\ntriggered a NULL pointer dereference in `ttm_resource_manager_usage()`. The root\ncause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,\nbut that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains\nuninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully\nset up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to\nacquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`, leading to\na kernel OOPS.\n\n1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth control check in\n   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for\n   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized\n   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific\n   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.\n\n2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info\n   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real VRAM\n   usage; otherwise, return 0. This avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is\n   NULL.\n\n3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)\n   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity: if the\n   manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage; otherwise, set\n   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).\n\nThis approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it:\n- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs),\n- Aligns with TTM's design by using

Create a single cyclic reference with many sockets\n    1-b. close() all sockets\n    1-c. Trigger GC\n\n  2)\n    2-a. Pass sk-A to an embryo sk-B\n    2-b. Pass sk-X to sk-X\n    2-c. Trigger GC\n\n  3)\n    3-a. accept() the embryo sk-B\n    3-b. Pass sk-B to sk-C\n    3-c. close() the in-flight sk-A\n    3-d. Trigger GC\n\nAs of 2-c, sk-A and sk-X are linked to unix_unvisited_vertices,\nand unix_walk_scc() groups them into two different SCCs:\n\n  unix_sk(sk-A)->vertex->scc_index = 2 (UNIX_VERTEX_INDEX_START)\n  unix_sk(sk-X)->vertex->scc_index = 3\n\nOnce GC completes, unix_graph_grouped is set to true.\nAlso, unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is set to true due to sk-X's\ncyclic self-reference, which makes close() trigger GC.\n\nAt 3-b, unix_add_edge() allocates unix_sk(sk-B)->vertex and\nlinks it to unix_unvisited_vertices.\n\nunix_update_graph() is called at 3-a. and 3-b., but neither\nunix_graph_grouped nor unix_graph_maybe_cyclic is changed\nbecause both sk-B's listener and sk-C are not in-flight.\n\n3-c decrements sk-A's file refcnt to 1.\n\nSince unix_graph_grouped is true at 3-d, unix_walk_scc_fast()\nis finally called and iterates 3 sockets sk-A, sk-B, and sk-X:\n\n  sk-A -> sk-B (-> sk-C)\n  sk-X -> sk-X\n\nThis is totally fine.  All of them are not yet close()d and\nshould be grouped into different SCCs.\n\nHowever, unix_vertex_dead() misjudges that sk-A and sk-B are\nin the same SCC and sk-A is dead.\n\n  unix_sk(sk-A)->scc_index == unix_sk(sk-B)->scc_index <-- Wrong!\n  &&\n  sk-A's file refcnt == unix_sk(sk-A)->vertex->out_degree\n                                       ^-- 1 in-flight count for sk-B\n  -> sk-A is dead !?\n\nThe problem is that unix_add_edge() does not initialise scc_index.\n\nStage 1) is used for heap spraying, making a newly allocated\nvertex have vertex->scc_index == 2 (UNIX_VERTEX_INDEX_START)\nset by unix_walk_scc() at 1-c.\n\nLet's track the max SCC index from the previous unix_walk_scc()\ncall and assign the max + 1 to a new vertex's scc_index.\n\nThis way, we can continue to avoid Tarjan's algorithm while\npreventing misjudgments.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"adfb68b39b39767d6bfb53e48c4f19c183765686"},{"fixed":"20003fbb9174121b27bd1da6ebe61542ac4c327d"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"d23802221f6755e104606864067c71af8cdb6788"},{"fixed":"4cd8d755c7d4f515dd9abf483316aca2f1b7b0f3"}]},{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"ad081928a8b0f57f269df999a28087fce6f2b6ce"},{"fixed":"db81ad20fd8aef7cc7d536c52ee5ea4c1f979128"},{"fixed":"1aa7e40ee850c9053e769957ce6541173891204d"},{"fixed":"60e6489f8e3b086bd1130ad4450a2c112e863791"}]}],"versions":["v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.6.100","v6.6.101","v6.6.102","v6.6.103","v6.6.104","v6.6.105","v6.6.106","v6.6.107","v6.6.108","v6.6.109","v6.6.110","v6.6.111","v6.6.112","v6.6.113","v6.6.114","v6.6.115","v6.6.116","v6.6.93","v6.6.94","v6.6.95","v6.6.96","v6.6.97","v6.6.98","v6.6.99","v6.9","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40214.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.1.159"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.6.117"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.59"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40214.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1aa7e40ee850c9053e769957ce6541173891204d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/20003fbb9174121b27bd1da6ebe61542ac4c327d"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4cd8d755c7d4f515dd9abf483316aca2f1b7b0f3"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/60e6489f8e3b086bd1130ad4450a2c112e863791"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db81ad20fd8aef7cc7d536c52ee5ea4c1f979128"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40214.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40214"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40214.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-07T18:18:51.053907Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40252","published":"2025-12-04T16:08:14.393Z","modified":"2025-12-07T03:26:35.302815Z","summary":"net:

inited to all-ones, but it must restrict\nit to the size of the first field, not the total field size.\n\nAfter each round in the map search step, the result and the fill map\nare swapped, so if we have a set where f->bsize of the first element\nis smaller than m->bsize_max, those one-bits are leaked into future\nrounds result map.\n\nThis makes pipapo find an incorrect matching results for sets

during\nuserfaultfd_release_all().  Specifically, a VMA which has a valid pointer\nto vma->vm_userfaultfd_ctx, but no UFFD flags in vma->vm_flags.\n\nThe inconsistency is caused in ksm_madvise(): when user calls madvise()\nwith MADV_UNMEARGEABLE on a VMA that is registered for UFFD in MINOR mode,\nit accidentally clears all flags stored in the upper 32 bits of\nvma->vm_flags.\n\nAssuming x86_64 kernel build, unsigned long is 64-bit and unsigned int and\nint are 32-bit wide.  This setup causes the following mishap during the &=\n~VM_MERGEABLE assignment.\n\nVM_MERGEABLE is a 32-bit constant of type unsigned int, 0x8000'0000. \nAfter ~ is applied, it becomes 0x7fff'ffff unsigned int, which is then\npromoted to unsigned long before the & operation.  This promotion fills\nupper 32 bits with leading 0s, as we're doing unsigned conversion (and\neven for a signed conversion, this wouldn't help as the leading bit is 0).\n& operation thus ends up AND-ing vm_flags with 0x0000'0000'7fff'ffff\ninstead of intended 0xffff'ffff'7fff'ffff and hence accidentally clears\nthe upper 32-bits of its value.\n\nFix it by changing `VM_MERGEABLE` constant to unsigned long, using the\nBIT() macro.\n\nNote: other VM_* flags are not affected: This only happens to the\nVM_MERGEABLE flag, as the other VM_* flags are all constants of type int\nand after ~ operation, they end up with leading 1 and are thus converted\nto unsigned long with leading 1s.\n\nNote 2:\nAfter commit 31defc3b01d9 (\"userfaultfd: remove (VM_)BUG_ON()s\"), this is\nno longer a

fix improper check of dentry.stream.valid_size","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nexfat: fix improper check of dentry.stream.valid_size\n\nWe found an infinite loop bug in the exFAT file system that can lead to a\nDenial-of-Service (DoS) condition. When a dentry in an exFAT filesystem is\nmalformed, the following system calls — SYS_openat, SYS_ftruncate, and\nSYS_pwrite64 — can cause the kernel to hang.\n\nRoot cause analysis shows that the size validation code in exfat_find()\ndoes not check whether dentry.stream.valid_size is negative. As a result,\nthe system calls mentioned above can succeed and eventually trigger the DoS\nissue.\n\nThis patch adds a check for negative dentry.stream.valid_size to prevent\nthis

78524b05f1a3 (\"mm, swap: avoid redundant swap device\npinning\"), the common helper for allocating and preparing a folio in the\nswap cache layer no longer tries to get a swap device reference\ninternally, because all callers of __read_swap_cache_async are already\nholding a swap entry reference.  The repeated swap device pinning isn't\nneeded on the same swap device.\n\nCaller of VMA readahead is also holding a reference to the target entry's\nswap device, but VMA readahead walks the page table, so it might encounter\nswap entries from other devices, and call __read_swap_cache_async on\nanother device without holding a reference to it.\n\nSo it is possible to cause a UAF when swapoff of device A raced with\nswapin on device B, and VMA readahead tries to read swap entries from\ndevice A.  It's not easy to trigger, but in theory, it could cause real\nissues.\n\nMake VMA readahead try to get the device reference first if the swap\ndevice is a different one from the target entry.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"78524b05f1a3e16a5d00cc9c6259c41a9d6003ce"},{"fixed":"a4145be7b56bfa87dce56415c3ad993071462b8a"},{"fixed":"1c2a936edd71e133f2806e68324ec81a4eb07588"}]}],"versions":["v6.14","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40270.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.15.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40270.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c2a936edd71e133f2806e68324ec81a4eb07588"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a4145be7b56bfa87dce56415c3ad993071462b8a"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40270.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40270"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40270.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-07T18:18:51.061072Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-22105","published":"2025-04-16T14:12:53.830Z","modified":"2025-12-07T03:09:02.313053Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2025:01707-1","SUSE-SU-2025:01919-1","SUSE-SU-2025:01951-1","SUSE-SU-2025:01964-1","SUSE-SU-2025:01967-1"],"summary":"bonding: check xdp prog when set bond mode","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbonding: check xdp prog when set bond mode\n\nFollowing operations can trigger a warning[1]:\n\n    ip netns add ns1\n    ip netns exec ns1 ip link add bond0 type bond mode balance-rr\n    ip netns exec ns1 ip link set dev bond0 xdp obj af_xdp_kern.o sec xdp\n    ip netns exec ns1 ip link set bond0 type bond mode broadcast\n    ip netns del ns1\n\nWhen delete the namespace, dev_xdp_uninstall() is called to remove xdp\nprogram on bond dev, and bond_xdp_set() will check the bond mode.

fix race between set_blocksize and read paths","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix race between set_blocksize and read paths\n\nWith the new large sector size support, it's now the case that\nset_blocksize can change i_blksize and the folio order in a manner that\nconflicts with a concurrent reader and causes a kernel crash.\n\nSpecifically, let's say that udev-worker calls libblkid to detect the\nlabels on a block device.  The read call can create an order-0 folio to\nread the first 4096 bytes from the disk.  But then udev is preempted.\n\nNext, someone tries to mount an 8k-sectorsize filesystem from the same\nblock device.  The filesystem calls set_blksize, which sets i_blksize to\n8192 and the minimum folio order to 1.\n\nNow udev resumes, still holding the order-0 folio it allocated.  It then\ntries to schedule a read bio and do_mpage_readahead tries to create\nbufferheads for the folio.  Unfortunately, blocks_per_folio == 0 because\nthe page size is 4096 but the blocksize is 8192 so no bufferheads are\nattached and the bh walk never sets bdev.  We then submit the bio with a\nNULL block device and crash.\n\nTherefore, truncate the page cache after flushing but before updating\ni_blksize.  However, that's not enough -- we also need to lock out file\nIO and page faults during the update.  Take both the i_rwsem and the\ninvalidate_lock in exclusive mode for invalidations, and in shared mode\nfor read/write operations.\n\nI don't know if this is the correct fix, but xfs/259 found

fix use-after-free race in fault handler","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/secretmem: fix use-after-free race in fault handler\n\nWhen a page fault occurs in a secret memory file created with\n`memfd_secret(2)`, the kernel will allocate a new folio for it, mark the\nunderlying page as not-present in the direct map, and add it to the file\nmapping.\n\nIf two tasks cause a fault in the same page concurrently, both could end\nup allocating a folio and removing the page from the direct map, but only\none would succeed in adding the folio to the file mapping.  The task that\nfailed undoes the effects of its attempt by (a) freeing the folio again\nand (b) putting the page back into the direct map.  However, by doing\nthese two operations in this order, the page becomes available to the\nallocator again before it is placed back in the direct mapping.\n\nIf another task attempts to allocate the

fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfuse: fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers\n\nI observed a hang when running generic/323 against a fuseblk server.\nThis test opens a file, initiates a lot of AIO writes to that file\ndescriptor, and closes the file descriptor before the writes complete.\nUnsurprisingly, the AIO exerciser threads are mostly stuck waiting for\nresponses from the fuseblk server:\n\n# cat /proc/372265/task/372313/stack\n[<0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]\n[<0>] __fuse_simple_request+0xd3/0x2b0 [fuse]\n[<0>] fuse_do_getattr+0xfc/0x1f0 [fuse]\n[<0>] fuse_file_read_iter+0xbe/0x1c0 [fuse]\n[<0>] aio_read+0x130/0x1e0\n[<0>] io_submit_one+0x542/0x860\n[<0>] __x64_sys_io_submit+0x98/0x1a0\n[<0>] do_syscall_64+0x37/0xf0\n[<0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nBut the /weird/ part is that the fuseblk server threads are waiting for\nresponses from itself:\n\n# cat /proc/372210/task/372232/stack\n[<0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]\n[<0>] __fuse_simple_request+0xd3/0x2b0 [fuse]\n[<0>] fuse_file_put+0x9a/0xd0 [fuse]\n[<0>] fuse_release+0x36/0x50 [fuse]\n[<0>] __fput+0xec/0x2b0\n[<0>] task_work_run+0x55/0x90\n[<0>] syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0xe9/0x100\n[<0>] do_syscall_64+0x43/0xf0\n[<0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nThe fuseblk server is fuse2fs so there's nothing all that exciting in\nthe server itself.  So why is the fuse server calling fuse_file_put?\nThe commit message for the fstest sheds some light on that:\n\n\"By closing the file descriptor before calling io_destroy, you pretty\nmuch guarantee that the last put on the ioctx will be done in interrupt\ncontext (during I/O completion).\n\nAha.  AIO fgets a new struct file from the fd when it queues the ioctx.\nThe completion of the FUSE_WRITE command from userspace causes the fuse\nserver to call the AIO completion function.  The completion puts the\nstruct file, queuing a delayed fput to the fuse server task.  When the\nfuse server task returns to userspace, it has to run the delayed fput,\nwhich in the case of a fuseblk server, it does synchronously.\n\nSending the FUSE_RELEASE command sychronously from fuse server threads\nis a bad idea because a client program can initiate enough simultaneous\nAIOs such that all the fuse server threads end up in delayed_fput, and\nnow there aren't any threads left to handle the queued fuse commands.\n\nFix this by only using asynchronous fputs when closing files, and leave\na comment explaining

HFS_SB(sb)->bitmap buffer is allocated in hfs_mdb_get():\n\nHFS_SB(sb)->bitmap = kmalloc(8192, GFP_KERNEL);\n\nFinally, it can trigger the reported issue because kmalloc()\ndoesn't clear the allocated memory. If allocated memory contains\nonly zeros, then everything will work pretty fine.\nBut if the allocated memory contains the \"garbage\", then\nit can affect the bitmap operations and it triggers\nthe reported issue.\n\nThis patch simply exchanges the kmalloc() on kzalloc()\nwith the goal to guarantee the correctness of bitmap operations.\nBecause, newly created allocation bitmap should have all\navailable blocks free.

ensure that memblock.current_limit is set when setting pfn limits","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnios2: ensure that memblock.current_limit is set when setting pfn limits\n\nOn nios2, with CONFIG_FLATMEM set, the kernel relies on\nmemblock_get_current_limit() to determine the limits of mem_map, in\nparticular for max_low_pfn.\nUnfortunately, memblock.current_limit is only default initialized to\nMEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ANYWHERE at this point of the bootup, potentially leading\nto situations where max_low_pfn can erroneously exceed the value of\nmax_pfn and, thus, the valid range of available DRAM.\n\nThis can in turn cause kernel-level paging failures, e.g.:\n\n[   76.900000] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 20303000\n[   76.900000] ea = c0080890, ra = c000462c, cause = 14\n[   76.900000] Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops\n[   76.900000] ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops ]---\n\nThis patch fixes

fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()\n\nSyzbot reported a potential lock inversion deadlock between\nvsock_register_mutex and sk_lock-AF_VSOCK when vsock_linger() is called.\n\nThe issue was introduced by commit 687aa0c5581b (\"vsock: Fix\ntransport_* TOCTOU\") which added vsock_register_mutex locking in\nvsock_assign_transport() around the transport->release() call, that can\ncall vsock_linger(). vsock_assign_transport() can be called with sk_lock\nheld. vsock_linger() calls sk_wait_event() that temporarily releases and\nre-acquires sk_lock. During this window, if another thread hold\nvsock_register_mutex while trying to acquire sk_lock, a circular\ndependency is created.\n\nFix this by releasing vsock_register_mutex before calling\ntransport->release() and vsock_deassign_transport(). This is safe\nbecause we don't need to hold vsock_register_mutex while releasing the\nold transport, and we ensure the new transport won't disappear by\nobtaining a module reference first via

usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmost: usb: Fix use-after-free in hdm_disconnect\n\nhdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which eventually\nunregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface->dev).\nIf that drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev()\nimmediately while hdm_disconnect() is still executing.\n\nThe old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in\nhdm_disconnect() and then performed additional put_device() calls.\nDepending on refcount order, this could lead to use-after-free or\ndouble-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also\nperformed puts).\n\nFix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(),\nso they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by\ndropping the extra put_device() calls in hdm_disconnect() that are\nredundant after

guard against EA inode refcount underflow in xattr update","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: guard against EA inode refcount underflow in xattr update\n\nsyzkaller found a path where ext4_xattr_inode_update_ref() reads an EA\ninode refcount that is already <= 0 and then applies ref_change (often\n-1). That lets the refcount underflow and we proceed with a bogus value,\ntriggering errors like:\n\n  EXT4-fs error: EA inode <n> ref underflow: ref_count=-1 ref_change=-1\n  EXT4-fs warning: ea_inode dec ref err=-117\n\nMake the invariant explicit: if the current refcount is non-positive,\ntreat this as on-disk corruption, emit ext4_error_inode(), and fail the\noperation with -EFSCORRUPTED instead of updating the refcount. Delete the\nWARN_ONCE() as negative refcounts are now impossible; keep error reporting\nin ext4_error_inode().\n\nThis prevents the underflow and the follow-on orphan/cleanup

(since\nv2.6.22-527-g7307de80510a) and calls fiemap_fill_next_extent() to read the\nextent list of this running mmap executable.  The user supplied buffer to\nhold the fiemap information page faults calling ocfs2_page_mkwrite() which\nwill take a write lock (since v2.6.27-38-g00dc417fa3e7) of the same\nsemaphore.  This recursive semaphore will hold filesystem locks and causes\na hang of the fileystem.\n\nThe ip_alloc_sem protects the inode extent list and size.  Release the\nread semphore before calling fiemap_fill_next_extent() in ocfs2_fiemap()\nand ocfs2_fiemap_inline().

rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndevlink: rate: Unset parent pointer in devl_rate_nodes_destroy\n\nThe function devl_rate_nodes_destroy is documented to \"Unset parent for\nall rate objects\". However, it was only calling the driver-specific\n`rate_leaf_parent_set` or `rate_node_parent_set` ops and decrementing\nthe parent's refcount, without actually setting the\n`devlink_rate->parent` pointer to NULL.\n\nThis leaves a dangling pointer in the `devlink_rate` struct, which cause\nrefcount error in netdevsim[1] and mlx5[2]. In addition, this is\ninconsistent with the behavior of `devlink_nl_rate_parent_node_set`,\nwhere the parent pointer is correctly cleared.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by explicitly setting `devlink_rate->parent`\nto NULL after notifying the driver, thus fulfilling the function's\ndocumented behavior for all rate objects.\n\n[1]\nrepro steps:\necho 1 >

This\nis for reading and writing page table accessed bits.

mlx5: Clean up only new IRQ glue on request_irq() failure","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Clean up only new IRQ glue on request_irq() failure\n\nThe mlx5_irq_alloc() function can inadvertently free the entire rmap\nand end up in a crash[1] when the other threads tries to access this,\nwhen request_irq() fails due to exhausted IRQ vectors. This commit\nmodifies the cleanup to remove only the specific IRQ mapping that was\njust added.\n\nThis prevents removal of other valid mappings and ensures precise\ncleanup of the failed IRQ allocation's associated glue object.\n\nNote: This error is observed when both fwctl and rds configs are enabled.\n\n[1]\nmlx5_core 0000:05:00.0: Successfully registered panic handler for port

Fix kernel panic on partial unmap of a GPU VA region","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panthor: Fix kernel panic on partial unmap of a GPU VA region\n\nThis commit address a kernel panic issue that can happen if Userspace\ntries to partially unmap a GPU virtual region (aka drm_gpuva).\nThe VM_BIND interface allows partial unmapping of a BO.\n\nPanthor driver pre-allocates memory for the new drm_gpuva structures\nthat would be needed for the map/unmap operation, done using drm_gpuvm\nlayer. It expected that only one new drm_gpuva would be needed on umap\nbut a partial unmap can require 2 new drm_gpuva and that's why it\nended up doing a NULL pointer dereference causing a kernel panic.\n\nFollowing dump was seen when partial unmap was exercised.\n Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000078\n Mem abort info:\n   ESR =

correct.  xfs_ifork::if_bytes is the size of the xfs_ifork::if_data\nbuffer.  if_bytes can be smaller than the data fork size because:\n\n(a) the forkoff code tries to keep the data area as large as possible\n(b) for symbolic links, if_bytes is the ondisk file size + 1\n(c) forkoff is always a multiple of 8.\n\nCase in point: for a single-byte symlink target, forkoff will be\n8 but the buffer will only be 2 bytes long.\n\nIn other words, the logic here is wrong and we walk off the end of the\nincore buffer.  Fix that.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"2651923d8d8db00a57665822f017fa7c76758044"},{"fixed":"7c2d68e091584149fe89bcbaf9b99b3162d46ee7"},{"fixed":"81a8685cac4bf081c93a7df591644f4f80240bb9"},{"fixed":"678e1cc2f482e0985a0613ab4a5bf89c497e5acc"}]}],"versions":["v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.59","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.9","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40246.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.10.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.60"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40246.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/678e1cc2f482e0985a0613ab4a5bf89c497e5acc"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7c2d68e091584149fe89bcbaf9b99b3162d46ee7"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81a8685cac4bf081c93a7df591644f4f80240bb9"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40246.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40246"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40246.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-07T18:18:51.057275Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-38715","published":"2025-09-04T15:33:09.954Z","modified":"2025-12-05T12:32:42.446135Z","related":["MGASA-2025-0234","MGASA-2025-0235","SUSE-SU-2025:3751-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4057-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4132-1"],"summary":"hfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds in hfs_bnode_read()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds in hfs_bnode_read()\n\nThis patch introduces is_bnode_offset_valid() method that checks\nthe requested offset value.

memory error injection on a THP (Transparent Huge Page)\nmapped to userspace on an x86 server, the kernel panics with the following\ntrace.  The expected behavior is to terminate the affected process instead\nof panicking the kernel, as the x86 Machine Check code can recover from an\nin-userspace #MC.\n\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 3: bd80000000070134\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffff8372f8bc> {memchr_inv+0x4c/0xf0}\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: TSC afff7bbff88a ADDR 1d301b000 MISC 80 PPIN 1e741e77539027db\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: PROCESSOR 0:d06d0 TIME 1758093249 SOCKET 0 APIC 0 microcode 80000320\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'\n  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel\n  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine check\n\nThe root cause of this panic is that handling a memory failure triggered\nby an in-userspace #MC necessitates splitting the THP.  The splitting\nprocess employs a mechanism, implemented in\ntry_to_map_unused_to_zeropage(), which reads the pages in the THP to\nidentify zero-filled pages.  However, reading the pages in the THP results\nin a second in-kernel #MC, occurring before the initial memory_failure()\ncompletes, ultimately leading to a kernel panic.

serial: sh-sci: fix RSCI FIFO overrun handling","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: serial: sh-sci: fix RSCI FIFO overrun handling\n\nThe receive error handling code is shared between RSCI and all other\nSCIF port types, but the RSCI overrun_reg is specified as a memory\noffset, while for other SCIF types it is an enum value used to index\ninto the sci_port_params->regs array, as mentioned above the\nsci_serial_in() function.\n\nFor RSCI, the overrun_reg is CSR (0x48), causing the sci_getreg() call\ninside the sci_handle_fifo_overrun() function to index outside the\nbounds of the regs array, which currently has a size of 20, as specified\nby SCI_NR_REGS.\n\nBecause of this, we end up accessing memory outside of RSCI's\nrsci_port_params structure, which, when interpreted as a plat_sci_reg,\nhappens to have a non-zero size, causing the following WARN when\nsci_serial_in() is called, as the accidental size does not match the\nsupported register sizes.\n\nThe existence of the overrun_reg needs to be checked because\nSCIx_SH3_SCIF_REGTYPE has overrun_reg set to SCLSR, but SCLSR is not\npresent in the regs array.\n\nAvoid calling sci_getreg() for port types which don't use standard\nregister handling.\n\nUse the ops->read_reg() and ops->write_reg() functions to properly read\nand write registers for RSCI, and change the type of the status variable\nto accommodate the 32-bit CSR register.\n\nsci_getreg() and sci_serial_in() are also called with overrun_reg in the\nsci_mpxed_interrupt() interrupt handler, but that code path is not used\nfor RSCI, as it does not have a muxed interrupt.\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nInvalid register access\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at

xfrm_state_delete_tunnel at destroy time for states that were never added\n\nIn commit b441cf3f8c4b (\"xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x\"), I\nmissed the case where state creation fails between full\ninitialization (->init_state has been called) and being inserted on\nthe lists.\n\nIn this situation, ->init_state has been called, so for IPcomp\ntunnels, the fallback tunnel has been created and added onto the\nlists, but the user state never gets added, because we fail before\nthat. The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we\ndon't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up\nleaking the FB tunnel.\n\nThere are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in\nboth net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,\nxfrm_state_migrate). A \"proper\" rollback of the init_state work would\nprobably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets\nmore complicated as multiple states may be involved.\n\nAt some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call\nxfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states\nwill have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,\nwhich solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)\naimed at. All states (including FB tunnels) will be removed from the\nlists once xfrm_state_fini has called flush_work(&xfrm_state_gc_work).","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b441cf3f8c4b8576639d20c8eb4aa32917602ecd"},{"fixed":"d6fe5c740c573af10943b8353992e1325cdb2715"},{"fixed":"10deb69864840ccf96b00ac2ab3a2055c0c04721"}]}],"versions":["v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40256.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40256.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10deb69864840ccf96b00ac2ab3a2055c0c04721"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6fe5c740c573af10943b8353992e1325cdb2715"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40256.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40256"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40256.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-07T18:18:51.058805Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40224","published":"2025-12-04T15:31:16.193Z","modified":"2025-12-05T12:29:44.113548Z","summary":"hwmon: (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing NULL check after devm_kzalloc()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing NULL check after devm_kzalloc()\n\nThe driver allocates memory for sensor data using devm_kzalloc(), but\ndid not check if the allocation succeeded.

It's possible\nthat a GPIO change, we want to notify the user-space about, happens\nAFTER the reference count on the file descriptor associated with the\ncharacter device went down to zero but BEFORE the .release() callback\nwas called from the workqueue and so BEFORE we unregistered from the\nnotifier.\n\nUsing the regular get_file() routine in this situation triggers the\nfollowing warning:\n\n  struct file::f_count incremented from zero; use-after-free condition present!\n\nSo use the get_file_active() variant that will return NULL on file\ndescriptors that have been or are being released.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"40b7c49950bd56c984b1f6722f865b922879260e"},{"fixed":"dccc6daa8afa0f64c432e4c867f275747e3415e1"},{"fixed":"d4cd0902c156b2ca60fdda8cd8b5bcb4b0e9ed64"}]}],"versions":["v6.12","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.17.9","v6.18-rc1","v6.18-rc2","v6.18-rc3","v6.18-rc4","v6.18-rc5","v6.18-rc6"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40249.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.10"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40249.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d4cd0902c156b2ca60fdda8cd8b5bcb4b0e9ed64"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dccc6daa8afa0f64c432e4c867f275747e3415e1"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40249.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40249"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40249.json"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-07T18:18:51.057709Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2025-40227","published":"2025-12-04T15:31:18.839Z","modified":"2025-12-05T12:28:37.948845Z","summary":"mm/damon/sysfs: dealloc commit test ctx always","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/sysfs: dealloc commit test ctx always\n\nThe damon_ctx for testing online DAMON parameters commit inputs is\ndeallocated only when the test fails.
