The\npacket sizes are limited by some factors such as wMaxPacketSize USB\ndescriptor.  OTOH, in the current code, the actually used packet sizes\nare determined only by the rate and the PPS, which may be bigger than\nthe size limit above.  This results in a buffer overflow, as reported\nby syzbot.\n\nBasically when the limit is smaller than the calculated packet size,\nit implies that something is wrong, most likely a weird USB\ndescriptor.  So the best option would be just to return an error at\nthe parameter setup time before doing any further operations.\n\nThis patch introduces such a sanity check, and returns -EINVAL when\nthe packet size is greater than maxpacksize.  The comparison with\nep->packsize[1] alone should suffice since it's always equal or\ngreater than

vmalloc-out-of-bounds\n\nAdd bounds checking to prevent writes past framebuffer boundaries when\nrendering text near screen edges. Return early if the Y position is off-screen\nand clip image height to screen boundary. Break from the rendering loop if the\nX position is off-screen. When clipping image width to fit the screen, update\nthe character count to match the clipped width to prevent buffer size\nmismatches.\n\nWithout the character count update, bit_putcs_aligned and bit_putcs_unaligned\nreceive mismatched parameters where the buffer is allocated for the clipped\nwidth but cnt reflects the original larger count, causing out-of-bounds

with the offset and length from hfs_brec_lenoff\n\n```\nlen = hfs_brec_lenoff(node, 2, &off16);\noff = off16;\n\noff += node->page_offset;\npagep = node->page + (off >> PAGE_SHIFT);\ndata = kmap_local_page(*pagep);\n```\n\nHowever, if the retrieved offset or length is invalid(i.e. exceeds\nnode_size), the code may end up accessing pages outside the allocated\nrange for this node.\n\nThis patch adds proper validation of both offset and length before use,\npreventing out-of-bounds page access.

the above issue, s_usr_quota_inum is set to 5, but inode<5> contains\nincorrect imode and disordered extents. Because 5 is EXT4_BOOT_LOADER_INO,\nthe ext4_ext_check_inode check in the ext4_iget function can be bypassed,\nfinally, the extents that are not checked trigger the BUG_ON in the\n__es_tree_search function. To solve this issue, check whether the inode is\nbad_inode in

refresh inline data size before write operations","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: refresh inline data size before write operations\n\nThe cached ei->i_inline_size can become stale between the initial size\ncheck and when ext4_update_inline_data()/ext4_create_inline_data() use\nit. Although ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads the correct value at the\ntime of the check, concurrent xattr operations can modify i_inline_size\nbefore ext4_write_lock_xattr() is acquired.\n\nThis causes ext4_update_inline_data() and ext4_create_inline_data() to\nwork with stale capacity values, leading to a BUG_ON() crash in\next4_write_inline_data():\n\n  kernel BUG at fs/ext4/inline.c:1331!\n  BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);\n\nThe race window:\n1. ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads i_inline_size = 60 (correct)\n2. Size check passes for 50-byte write\n3. [Another thread adds xattr, i_inline_size changes to 40]\n4. ext4_write_lock_xattr() acquires lock\n5. ext4_update_inline_data() uses stale i_inline_size = 60\n6. Attempts to write 50 bytes but only 40 bytes actually available\n7. BUG_ON() triggers\n\nFix this by recalculating i_inline_size via ext4_find_inline_data_nolock()\nimmediately after acquiring xattr_sem. This ensures ext4_update_inline_data()\nand ext4_create_inline_data() work with current values that are protected\nfrom concurrent modifications.\n\nThis is similar to commit a54c4613dac1 (\"ext4: fix race writing to an\ninline_data file while its xattrs are changing\") which fixed i_inline_off\nstaleness. This patch addresses the related i_inline_size staleness issue.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"67cf5b09a46f72e048501b84996f2f77bc42e947"},{"fixed":"210ac60a86a3ad2c76ae60e0dc71c34af6e7ea0b"},{"fixed":"ca43ea29b4c4d2764aec8a26cffcfb677a871e6e"},{"fixed":"58df743faf21ceb1880f930aa5dd428e2a5e415d"},{"fixed":"892e1cf17555735e9d021ab036c36bc7b58b0e3b"}]}],"versions":["v3.10","v3.10-rc1","v3.10-rc2","v3.10-rc3","v3.10-rc4","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.13-rc4","v3.13-rc5","v3.13-rc6","v3.13-rc7","v3.13-rc8","v3.14","v3.14-rc1","v3.14-rc2","v3.14-rc3","v3.14-rc4","v3.14-rc5","v3.14-rc6","v3.14-rc7","v3.14-rc8","v3.15","v3.15-rc1","v3.15-rc2","v3.15-rc3","v3.15-rc4","v3.15-rc5","v3.15-rc6","v3.15-rc7","v3.15-rc8","v3.16","v3.16-rc1","v3.16-rc2","v3.16-rc3","v3.16-rc4","v3.16-rc5","v3.16-rc6","v3.16-rc7","v3.17","v3.17-rc1","v3.17-rc2","v3.17-rc3","v3.17-rc4","v3.17-rc5","v3.17-rc6","v3.17-rc7","v3.18","v3.18-rc1","v3.18-rc2","v3.18-rc3","v3.18-rc4","v3.18-rc5","v3.18-rc6","v3.18-rc7","v3.19","v3.19-rc1","v3.19-rc2","v3.19-rc3","v3.19-rc4","v3.19-rc5","v3.19-rc6","v3.19-rc7","v3.7","v3.7-rc4","v3.7-rc5","v3.7-rc6","v3.7-rc7","v3.7-rc8","v3.8","v3.8-rc1","v3.8-rc2","v3.8-rc3","v3.8-rc4","v3.8-rc5","v3.8-rc6","v3.8-rc7","v3.9","v3.9-rc1","v3.9-rc2","v3.9-rc3","v3.9-rc4","v3.9-rc5","v3.9-rc6","v3.9-rc7","v3.9-rc8","v4.0","v4.0-rc1","v4.0-rc2","v4.0-rc3","v4.0-rc4","v4.0-rc5","v4.0-rc6","v4.0-rc7","v4.1","v4.1-rc1","v4.1-rc2","v4.1-rc3","v4.1-rc4","v4.1-rc5","v4.1-rc6","v4.1-rc7","v4.1-rc8","v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.2","v4.2-rc1","v4.2-rc2","v4.2-rc3","v4.2-rc4","v4.2-rc5","v4.2-rc6","v4.2-rc7","v4.2-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.3","v4.3-rc1","v4.3-rc2","v4.3-rc3","v4.3-rc4","v4.3-rc5","v4.3-rc6","v4.3-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc1","v4.4-rc2","v4.4-rc3","v4.4-rc4","v4.4-rc5","v4.4-rc6","v4.4-rc7","v4.4-rc8","v4.5","v4.5-rc1","v4.5-rc2","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6-rc6","v4.6-rc7","v4.7","v4.7-rc1","v4.7-rc2","v4.7-rc3","v4.7-rc4","v4.7-rc5","v4.7-rc6","v4.7-rc7","v4.8","v4.8-rc1","v4.8-rc2","v4.8-rc3","v4.8-rc4","v4.8-rc5","v4.8-rc6","v4.8-rc7","v4.8-rc8","v4.9","v4.9-rc1","v4.9-rc2","v4.9-rc3","v4.9-rc4","v4.9-rc5","v4.9-rc6","v4.9-rc7","v4.9-rc8","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","

ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix UFS OCP issue during UFS power down (PC=3)","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: ufs: ufs-qcom: Fix UFS OCP issue during UFS power down (PC=3)\n\nAccording to UFS specifications, the power-off sequence for a UFS device\nincludes:\n\n - Sending an SSU command with Power_Condition=3 and await a response.\n\n - Asserting RST_N low.\n\n - Turning off REF_CLK.\n\n - Turning off VCC.\n\n - Turning off VCCQ/VCCQ2.\n\nAs part of ufs shutdown, after the SSU command completion, asserting\nhardware reset (HWRST) triggers the device firmware to wake up and\nexecute its reset routine. This routine initializes hardware blocks and\ntakes a few milliseconds to complete. During this time, the ICCQ draws a\nlarge current.\n\nThis large ICCQ current may cause issues for the regulator which is\nsupplying power to UFS, because the turn off request from UFS driver to\nthe regulator framework will be immediately followed by low power\nmode(LPM) request by regulator framework. This is done by framework\nbecause UFS which is the only client is requesting for disable. So if\nthe rail is still in the process of shutting down while ICCQ exceeds LPM\ncurrent thresholds, and LPM mode is activated in hardware during this\nstate, it may trigger an overcurrent protection (OCP) fault in the\nregulator.\n\nTo prevent this, a 10ms delay is added after asserting HWRST. This\nallows the reset operation to complete while power rails remain active\nand in high-power mode.\n\nCurrently there is no way for Host to query whether the reset is\ncompleted or not and hence this the delay is based on experiments with\nQualcomm UFS controllers across multiple UFS

target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: target_core_configfs: Add length check to avoid buffer overflow\n\nA buffer overflow arises from the usage of snprintf to write into the\nbuffer \"buf\" in target_lu_gp_members_show function located in\n/drivers/target/target_core_configfs.c. This buffer is allocated with\nsize LU_GROUP_NAME_BUF (256 bytes).\n\nsnprintf(...) formats multiple strings into buf with the HBA name\n(hba->hba_group.cg_item), a slash character, a devicename (dev->\ndev_group.cg_item) and a newline character, the total formatted string\nlength may exceed the buffer size of 256 bytes.\n\nSince snprintf() returns the total number of bytes that would have

sch_qfq: Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_qfq: Fix null-deref in agg_dequeue\n\nTo prevent a potential crash in agg_dequeue (net/sched/sch_qfq.c)\nwhen cl->qdisc->ops->peek(cl->qdisc) returns NULL, we check the return\nvalue before using it, similar to the existing approach in sch_hfsc.c.\n\nTo avoid code duplication, the following changes are made:\n\n1. Changed qdisc_warn_nonwc(include/net/pkt_sched.h) into a static\ninline function.\n\n2. Moved qdisc_peek_len from net/sched/sch_hfsc.c to\ninclude/net/pkt_sched.h so that sch_qfq can reuse it.\n\n3. Applied qdisc_peek_len in agg_dequeue to avoid

ESR IE parsing\n\nThe Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling in OnBeacon accessed\n*(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these\noffsets lie within the received frame buffer.

parser\n\nThe Information Element (IE) parser rtw_get_ie() trusted the length\nbyte of each IE without validating that the IE body (len bytes after\nthe 2-byte header) fits inside the remaining frame buffer. A malformed\nframe can advertise an IE length larger than the available data, causing\nthe parser to increment its pointer beyond the buffer end. This results\nin out-of-bounds reads or, depending on the pattern, an infinite loop.\n\nFix by validating that (offset + 2 + len) does not exceed the limit\nbefore accepting the IE or advancing to the next element.\n\nThis prevents OOB reads and ensures the parser terminates safely on\nmalformed

brelse() is called on both ofibh.sbh\nand ofibh.ebh by udf_find_entry() when it returns NULL.  However,\nbrelse() is called by udf_rename(), too.  So, b_count on buffer_head\nbecomes unbalanced.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by not calling brelse() by udf_rename()\nwhen udf_find_entry() returns

gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: gadget: f_fs: Fix epfile null pointer access after ep enable.\n\nA race condition occurs when ffs_func_eps_enable() runs concurrently\nwith ffs_data_reset(). The ffs_data_clear() called in ffs_data_reset()\nsets ffs->epfiles to NULL before resetting ffs->eps_count to 0, leading\nto a NULL pointer dereference when accessing epfile->ep in\nffs_func_eps_enable() after successful usb_ep_enable().\n\nThe ffs->epfiles pointer is set to NULL in both ffs_data_clear() and\nffs_data_close() functions, and its modification is protected by the\nspinlock ffs->eps_lock. And the whole ffs_func_eps_enable() function\nis also protected by ffs->eps_lock.\n\nThus, add NULL pointer handling for ffs->epfiles in the\nffs_func_eps_enable() function to fix

Currently the header include/linux/soc/ti/knav_dma.h\nreturns NULL when the driver is disabled, but the driver\nimplementation does not even return NULL or ERR_PTR on failure,\ncausing inconsistency in the users. This results in a crash in\nnetcp_free_navigator_resources as followed (trimmed):\n\nUnhandled fault: alignment exception (0x221) at 0xfffffff2\n[fffffff2] *pgd=80000800207003, *pmd=82ffda003, *pte=00000000\nInternal error: : 221 [#1] SMP ARM\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 6.17.0-rc7 #1 NONE\nHardware name: Keystone\nPC is at knav_dma_close_channel+0x30/0x19c\nLR is at netcp_free_navigator_resources+0x2c/0x28c\n\n[...

fix uninitialized waitqueue in transaction manager","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: fix uninitialized waitqueue in transaction manager\n\nThe transaction manager initialization in txInit() was not properly\ninitializing TxBlock[0].waitor waitqueue, causing a crash when\ntxEnd(0) is called on read-only filesystems.\n\nWhen a filesystem is mounted read-only, txBegin() returns tid=0 to\nindicate no transaction. However, txEnd(0) still gets called and\ntries to access TxBlock[0].waitor via tid_to_tblock(0), but this\nwaitqueue was never initialized because the initialization loop\nstarted at index 1 instead

pidff_find_fields\n\nThis function triggered a null pointer dereference if used to search for\na report that isn't implemented on the device. This happened both for\noptional and required reports alike.\n\nThe same logic was applied to pidff_find_special_field and although\npidff_init_fields should return an error earlier if one of the required\nreports is missing, future modifications could change this logic and\nresurface this possible null pointer dereference again.\n\nLKML bug

On some systems, this could lead to a\nNULL dereference and a kernel warning or panic.\n\nThis patch adds a check using unlikely() and returns early if the\npolicy is NULL.\n\nBugzilla:

that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when\nthe S_IFMT bits of the 32bits \"mode\" field loaded from disk are corrupted\nor when the 32bits \"attributes\" field loaded from disk are corrupted.\n\nA documentation says that BFS uses only lower 9 bits of the \"mode\" field.\nBut I can't find an explicit explanation that the unused upper 23 bits\n(especially, the S_IFMT bits) are

imon: make send_packet() more robust","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: imon: make send_packet() more robust\n\nsyzbot is reporting that imon has three problems which result in\nhung tasks due to forever holding device lock [1].\n\nFirst problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\nafter ictx->dev_present_intf0 became true, usb_rx_callback_intf0()\nresubmits urb after printk(), and resubmitted urb causes\nusb_rx_callback_intf0() to again get -EPROTO error. This results in\nprintk() flooding (RCU stalls).\n\nAlan Stern commented [2] that\n\n  In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust\n  error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the\n  number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed, perhaps with a\n  time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to\n  do this; they simply give up right away.  This makes them more\n  vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers, but in\n  reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong\n  with giving up right away.\n\nbut imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever;\nthis behavior should be fixed.\n\nSince I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any\nerror code, this patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from\nmodules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.\nir_toy, mceusb and igorplugusb).\n\nSecond problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\nbefore ictx->dev_present_intf0 becomes true, usb_rx_callback_intf0() always\nresubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf (\"[media] imon: don't wedge\nhardware after early callbacks\"). Move the ictx->dev_present_intf0 test\nintroduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a (\"[media] imon: don't parse scancodes\nuntil intf configured\") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet(), or\nthe first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.\nhung task).\n\nThird problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some\nreason (e.g. flaky hardware; the reproducer for this problem sometimes\nprevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called),\nwait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.\nhung task). As a workaround for such situation, change send_packet() to\nwait for completion with timeout of 10

delete radeon_fence_process in is_signaled, no deadlock","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/radeon: delete radeon_fence_process in is_signaled, no deadlock\n\nDelete the attempt to progress the queue when checking if fence is\nsignaled. This avoids deadlock.\n\ndma-fence_ops::signaled can be called with the fence lock in unknown\nstate. For radeon, the fence lock is also the wait queue lock. This can\ncause a self deadlock when signaled() tries to make forward progress on\nthe wait queue. But advancing the queue is unneeded because incorrectly\nreturning false from signaled() is perfectly acceptable.\n\n(cherry picked from commit

Fix double SIGFPE crash","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: Fix double SIGFPE crash\n\nCamm noticed that on parisc a SIGFPE exception will crash an application with\na second SIGFPE in the signal handler.  Dave analyzed it, and it happens\nbecause glibc uses a double-word floating-point store to atomically update\nfunction descriptors. As a result of lazy binding, we hit a floating-point\nstore in fpe_func almost immediately.\n\nWhen the T bit is set, an assist exception trap occurs when when the\nco-processor encounters *any* floating-point instruction except for a double\nstore of register %fr0.  The latter cancels all pending traps.  Let's fix this\nby clearing the Trap (T) bit in the FP status register before returning to the\nsignal handler in userspace.\n\nThe issue can be reproduced with this test program:\n\nroot@parisc:~#

HFS_SB(sb)->bitmap buffer is allocated in hfs_mdb_get():\n\nHFS_SB(sb)->bitmap = kmalloc(8192, GFP_KERNEL);\n\nFinally, it can trigger the reported issue because kmalloc()\ndoesn't clear the allocated memory. If allocated memory contains\nonly zeros, then everything will work pretty fine.\nBut if the allocated memory contains the \"garbage\", then\nit can affect the bitmap operations and it triggers\nthe reported issue.\n\nThis patch simply exchanges the kmalloc() on kzalloc()\nwith the goal to guarantee the correctness of bitmap operations.\nBecause, newly created allocation bitmap should have all\navailable blocks free.

avoid device tree lookups in rtas_os_term()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/rtas: avoid device tree lookups in rtas_os_term()\n\nrtas_os_term() is called during panic. Its behavior depends on a couple\nof conditions in the /rtas node of the device tree, the traversal of\nwhich entails locking and local IRQ state changes. If the kernel panics\nwhile devtree_lock is held, rtas_os_term() as currently written could\nhang.\n\nInstead of discovering the relevant characteristics at panic time,\ncache them in file-static variables at boot. Note the lookup for\n\"ibm,extended-os-term\" is converted to of_property_read_bool() since it\nis a boolean property, not an RTAS function token.\n\n[mpe: Incorporate suggested change from

ibft_attr_show_nic()\n\nWhen performing an iSCSI boot using IPv6, iscsistart still reads the\n/sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry.

exists of:\n  &q->sysfs_lock --> &q->rq_qos_mutex --> &q->q_usage_counter(queue)#3\n\n Possible unsafe locking scenario:\n\n       CPU0                    CPU1\n       ----                    ----\n

is that queue_usage_counter is grabbed with rq_qos_mutex\nheld in blkg_conf_prep(), while queue should be freezed before\nrq_qos_mutex from other context.\n\nThe blk_queue_enter() from blkg_conf_prep() is used to protect against\npolicy deactivation, which is already protected with blkcg_mutex, hence\nconvert blk_queue_enter() to blkcg_mutex to fix this problem.

null-ptr-deref in dib7090p_rw_on_apb()\n\nIn dib7090p_rw_on_apb, msg is controlled by user. When msg[0].buf is null and\nmsg[0].len is zero, former checks on msg[0].buf would be passed. If accessing\nmsg[0].buf[2] without sanity check, null pointer deref would happen.

Set fb_display[i]->mode to NULL when the mode is released","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbcon: Set fb_display[i]->mode to NULL when the mode is released\n\nRecently, we discovered the following issue through syzkaller:\n\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in fb_mode_is_equal+0x285/0x2f0\nRead of size 4 at addr ff11000001b3c69c by task

entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nBased on experimentation and analysis, during framebuffer unregistration,\nonly the memory of fb_info->modelist is freed, without setting the\ncorresponding fb_display[i]->mode to NULL for the freed modes. This leads\nto UAF issues during subsequent accesses. Here's an example of reproduction\nsteps:\n1. With /dev/fb0 already registered in the system, load a kernel module\n   to register a new device /dev/fb1;\n2. Set fb1's mode to the global fb_display[] array (via FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP);\n3. Switch console from fb to VGA (to allow normal rmmod of the ko);\n4. Unload the kernel module, at this point fb1's modelist is freed, leaving\n   a wild pointer in fb_display[];\n5.

when loading amdgpu module.\nIf a module has a lot of tracable functions, multiple calls\nto kallsyms_lookup can spend too much time in RCU critical\nsection and with disabled preemption, causing kernel panic.\nThis is the same issue that was fixed in\ncommit d0b24b4e91fc (\"ftrace: Prevent RCU stall on PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY\nkernels\") and commit 42ea22e754ba (\"ftrace: Add cond_resched() to\nftrace_graph_set_hash()\").\n\nFix it the same way by adding cond_resched() in

VT6415/VT6330\n\nThe controller has a hardware bug that can hard hang the system when\ndoing ATAPI DMAs without any trace of what happened. Depending on the\ndevice attached, it can also prevent the system from booting.\n\nIn this case, the system hangs when reading the ATIP from optical media\nwith cdrecord -vvv -atip on an _NEC DVD_RW ND-4571A 1-01 and an\nOptiarc DVD RW AD-7200A 1.06 attached to an ASRock 990FX Extreme 4,\nrunning at UDMA/33.\n\nThe issue can be reproduced by running the same command with a cygwin\nbuild of cdrecord on WinXP, although it requires more attempts to cause\nit. The hang in that case is also resolved by forcing PIO. It doesn't\nappear that VIA has produced any drivers for that OS, thus no known\nworkaround exists.\n\nHDDs attached to the controller do not suffer from any DMA

While kernel terminates\nACPI function, kmem_cache_destroy() reports Acpi-Operand cache leak.\n\nBoot log of ACPI operand cache leak is as follows:\n>[    0.585957] ACPI: Added _OSI(Module Device)\n>[    0.587218] ACPI: Added _OSI(Processor Device)\n>[    0.588530] ACPI: Added _OSI(3.0 _SCP Extensions)\n>[    0.589790] ACPI: Added _OSI(Processor Aggregator Device)\n>[    0.591534] ACPI Error: Illegal I/O port address/length above 64K: C806E00000004002/0x2 (20170303/hwvalid-155)\n>[    0.594351] ACPI Exception: AE_LIMIT, Unable to initialize fixed events (20170303/evevent-88)\n>[    0.597858] ACPI: Unable to start the ACPI Interpreter\n>[    0.599162] ACPI Error: Could not remove SCI handler (20170303/evmisc-281)\n>[    0.601836] kmem_cache_destroy Acpi-Operand: Slab cache still has objects\n>[    0.603556] CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.12.0-rc5 #26\n>[    0.605159] Hardware name: innotek gmb_h virtual_box/virtual_box, BIOS virtual_box 12/01/2006\n>[    0.609177] Call Trace:\n>[    0.610063]  ? dump_stack+0x5c/0x81\n>[    0.611118]  ? kmem_cache_destroy+0x1aa/0x1c0\n>[    0.612632]  ? acpi_sleep_proc_init+0x27/0x27\n>[    0.613906]  ? acpi_os_delete_cache+0xa/0x10\n>[    0.617986]  ? acpi_ut_delete_caches+0x3f/0x7b\n>[    0.619293]  ? acpi_terminate+0xa/0x14\n>[    0.620394]  ? acpi_init+0x2af/0x34f\n>[    0.621616]  ? __class_create+0x4c/0x80\n>[    0.623412]  ? video_setup+0x7f/0x7f\n>[    0.624585]  ? acpi_sleep_proc_init+0x27/0x27\n>[    0.625861]  ? do_one_initcall+0x4e/0x1a0\n>[    0.627513]  ? kernel_init_freeable+0x19e/0x21f\n>[    0.628972]  ? rest_init+0x80/0x80\n>[    0.630043]  ? kernel_init+0xa/0x100\n>[    0.631084]  ? ret_from_fork+0x25/0x30\n>[    0.633343] vgaarb: loaded\n>[    0.635036] EDAC MC: Ver: 3.0.0\n>[    0.638601] PCI: Probing PCI hardware\n>[    0.639833] PCI host bridge to bus 0000:00\n>[    0.641031] pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0xffff]\n> ...

Don't leak robust_list pointer on exec race","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfutex: Don't leak robust_list pointer on exec race\n\nsys_get_robust_list() and compat_get_robust_list() use ptrace_may_access()\nto check if the calling task is allowed to access another task's\nrobust_list pointer. This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the\ntarget process.\n\nDuring exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a\nprivileged one (e.g., setuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings\nmay change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access() before\nthis transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information\nafter the target becomes privileged.\n\nA racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which\nptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a\nprivileged state via exec().\n\nFor example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a\nsetuid-root binary. An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T\nis still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions\nbased on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec\nimmediately afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory\nmappings. Because get_robust_list() proceeds to access T->robust_list\nwithout synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space pointers from a\nnow-privileged process.\n\nThis violates the intended post-exec access restrictions and could\nexpose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger\nexploit chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized\ndisclosure of information across privilege boundaries and poses a\npotential security risk.\n\nTake a read lock on signal->exec_update_lock prior to

Add conditional IBPB mitigation","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/vmscape: Add conditional IBPB mitigation\n\nVMSCAPE is a vulnerability that exploits insufficient branch predictor\nisolation between a guest and a userspace hypervisor (like QEMU). Existing\nmitigations already protect kernel/KVM from a malicious guest. Userspace\ncan additionally be protected by flushing the branch predictors after a\nVMexit.\n\nSince it is the userspace that consumes the poisoned branch predictors,\nconditionally issue an IBPB after a VMexit and before returning to\nuserspace. Workloads that frequently switch between hypervisor and\nuserspace will incur the most overhead from the new IBPB.\n\nThis new IBPB is not integrated with the existing IBPB sites. For\ninstance, a task can use the existing speculation control prctl() to\nget an IBPB at context switch time. With this implementation, the\nIBPB is doubled up: one at context switch and another before running\nuserspace.\n\nThe intent is to integrate and optimize these cases post-embargo.\n\n[ dhansen:

don't clear IMA_DIGSIG flag when setting or removing non-IMA xattr","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nima: don't clear IMA_DIGSIG flag when setting or removing non-IMA xattr\n\nCurrently when both IMA and EVM are in fix mode, the IMA signature will\nbe reset to IMA hash if a program first stores IMA signature in\nsecurity.ima and then writes/removes some other security xattr for the\nfile.\n\nFor example, on Fedora, after booting the kernel with \"ima_appraise=fix\nevm=fix ima_policy=appraise_tcb\" and installing rpm-plugin-ima,\ninstalling/reinstalling a package will not make good reference IMA\nsignature generated. Instead IMA hash is generated,\n\n    # getfattr -m - -d -e hex /usr/bin/bash\n    # file: usr/bin/bash\n    security.ima=0x0404...\n\nThis happens because when setting security.selinux, the IMA_DIGSIG flag\nthat had been set early was cleared. As a result, IMA hash is generated\nwhen the file is closed.\n\nSimilarly, IMA signature can be cleared on file close after removing\nsecurity xattr like security.evm or setting/removing ACL.\n\nPrevent replacing the IMA file signature with a file hash, by preventing\nthe IMA_DIGSIG flag from being reset.\n\nHere's a minimal C reproducer which sets security.selinux as the last\nstep

prevent softlockup in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njbd2: prevent softlockup in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()\n\nBoth jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() and jbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list()\nperiodically release j_list_lock after processing a batch of buffers to\navoid long hold times on the j_list_lock. However, since both functions\ncontend for j_list_lock, the combined time spent waiting and processing\ncan be significant.\n\njbd2_journal_shrink_checkpoint_list() explicitly calls cond_resched() when\nneed_resched() is true to avoid softlockups during prolonged operations.\nBut jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() only exits its loop when need_resched() is\ntrue, relying on potentially sleeping functions like __flush_batch() or\nwait_on_buffer() to trigger rescheduling. If those functions do not sleep,\nthe kernel may hit a softlockup.\n\nwatchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#3 stuck for 156s!

Don't disable x2APIC if locked","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/apic: Don't disable x2APIC if locked\n\nThe APIC supports two modes, legacy APIC (or xAPIC), and Extended APIC\n(or x2APIC).  X2APIC mode is mostly compatible with legacy APIC, but\nit disables the memory-mapped APIC interface in favor of one that uses\nMSRs.  The APIC mode is controlled by the EXT bit in the APIC MSR.\n\nThe MMIO/xAPIC interface has some problems, most notably the APIC LEAK\n[1].  This bug allows an attacker to use the APIC MMIO interface to\nextract data from the SGX enclave.\n\nIntroduce support for a new feature that will allow the BIOS to lock\nthe APIC in x2APIC mode.  If the APIC is locked in x2APIC mode and the\nkernel tries to disable the APIC or revert to legacy APIC mode a GP\nfault will occur.\n\nIntroduce support for a new MSR (IA32_XAPIC_DISABLE_STATUS) and handle\nthe new locked mode when the LEGACY_XAPIC_DISABLED bit is set by\npreventing the kernel from trying to disable the x2APIC.\n\nOn platforms with the IA32_XAPIC_DISABLE_STATUS MSR, if SGX or TDX are\nenabled the LEGACY_XAPIC_DISABLED will be set by the BIOS.  If\nlegacy APIC is required, then it SGX and TDX need to be disabled in the\nBIOS.\n\n[1]:

pcm: Fix race of buffer access at PCM OSS layer","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: pcm: Fix race of buffer access at PCM OSS layer\n\nThe PCM OSS layer tries to clear the buffer with the silence data at\ninitialization (or reconfiguration) of a stream with the explicit call\nof snd_pcm_format_set_silence() with runtime->dma_area.  But this may\nlead to a UAF because the accessed runtime->dma_area might be freed\nconcurrently, as it's performed outside the PCM ops.\n\nFor avoiding it, move the code into the PCM core and perform it inside\nthe buffer access lock, so that it won't be changed during

write\n\nWhen writing an empty string to either 'qw_sign' or 'landingPage'\nsysfs attributes, the store functions attempt to access page[l - 1]\nbefore validating that the length 'l' is greater than zero.\n\nThis patch fixes the vulnerability by adding a check at the beginning\nof os_desc_qw_sign_store() and webusb_landingPage_store() to handle\nthe zero-length input case gracefully by returning

add missing kref_get in handle_write_conflicts","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrbd: add missing kref_get in handle_write_conflicts\n\nWith `two-primaries` enabled, DRBD tries to detect \"concurrent\" writes\nand handle write conflicts, so that even if you write to the same sector\nsimultaneously on both nodes, they end up with the identical data once\nthe writes are completed.\n\nIn handling \"superseeded\" writes, we forgot a kref_get,\nresulting in a premature drbd_destroy_device and use after free,\nand further to kernel crashes with symptoms.\n\nRelevance: No one should use DRBD as a random data generator, and apparently\nall users of \"two-primaries\" handle concurrent writes correctly on layer up.\nThat is cluster file systems use some distributed lock manager,\nand live migration in virtualization environments stops writes on one node\nbefore starting writes on the other node.\n\nWhich means that other than for \"test cases\",\nthis code path is never taken in real life.\n\nFYI, in DRBD 9, things are handled differently nowadays.  We still detect\n\"write conflicts\", but no longer try to be smart about them.\nWe decided to disconnect hard instead: upper layers must not submit concurrent\nwrites. If they do, that's their

potential integer overflow in usbg_make_tpg()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: potential integer overflow in usbg_make_tpg()\n\nThe variable tpgt in usbg_make_tpg() is defined as unsigned long and is\nassigned to tpgt->tport_tpgt, which is defined as u16. This may cause an\ninteger overflow when tpgt is greater than USHRT_MAX (65535). I\nhaven't tried to trigger it myself, but it is possible to trigger it\nby calling usbg_make_tpg() with a large value for tpgt.\n\nI modified the type of tpgt to match tpgt->tport_tpgt and adjusted the\nrelevant code accordingly.\n\nThis patch is similar to commit 59c816c1f24d (\"vhost/scsi: potential\nmemory

Revise __get_user() to probe user read access","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: Revise __get_user() to probe user read access\n\nBecause of the way read access support is implemented, read access\ninterruptions are only triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3. The\nkernel executes at privilege level 0, so __get_user() never triggers\na read access interruption (code 26). Thus, it is currently possible\nfor user code to access a read protected address via a system call.\n\nFix this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER)\nand setting __gu_err to -EFAULT (-14) if access isn't allowed.\n\nNote the cmpiclr instruction does a 32-bit compare because COND macro\ndoesn't work inside

Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation\n\nThe JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 <<\nl2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with >2TB\naggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined\nbehavior and improper AG sizing.\n\nOn 32-bit architectures:\n- Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow\n- This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in\nsbi->bmap->db_agsize\n- Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures\n- Could lead to:\n  - Filesystem corruption during extend operations\n  - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses\n  - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures\n\nFix by casting to s64 before shifting:\nbmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize;\n\nThis ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast\nmatches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in\nJFS block calculation code.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with

brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()\n\nOn removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL\npointer dereference occurs.\n\nThe following sequence deletes the interface:\n\n  brcmf_detach()\n    brcmf_remove_interface()\n      brcmf_del_if()\n\nInside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to\nBRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.\n\nAfter brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is\ncalled providing the following sequence:\n\n  brcmf_detach()\n    brcmf_proto_detach()\n      brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()\n        brcmf_flowring_detach()\n          brcmf_msgbuf_delete_flowring()\n            brcmf_msgbuf_remove_flowring()\n              brcmf_flowring_delete()\n                brcmf_get_ifp()\n                brcmf_txfinalize()\n\nSince brcmf_get_ip() can and actually will return NULL in this case the\ncall to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside\nbrcmf_txfinalize() when
