This patch fixes the issue by explicitly calling\nksmbd_user_session_put to release the reference to the

make free_choose_arg_map() resilient to partial allocation","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibceph: make free_choose_arg_map() resilient to partial allocation\n\nfree_choose_arg_map() may dereference a NULL pointer if its caller fails\nafter a partial allocation.\n\nFor example, in decode_choose_args(), if allocation of arg_map->args\nfails, execution jumps to the fail label and free_choose_arg_map() is\ncalled. Since arg_map->size is updated to a non-zero value before memory\nallocation, free_choose_arg_map() will iterate over arg_map->args and\ndereference a NULL pointer.\n\nTo prevent this potential NULL pointer dereference and make\nfree_choose_arg_map() more resilient, add checks for pointers

mscc: ocelot: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mscc: ocelot: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag\n\nCommit 15faa1f67ab4 (\"lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag\")\nfixed a similar issue in the lan966x driver caused by a NULL pointer dereference.\nThe ocelot_set_aggr_pgids() function in the ocelot driver has similar logic\nand is susceptible to the same crash.\n\nThis issue specifically affects the ocelot_vsc7514.c frontend, which leaves\nunused ports as NULL pointers. The felix_vsc9959.c frontend is unaffected as\nit uses the DSA framework which registers all ports.\n\nFix this by checking if the port pointer is valid before accessing it.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"528d3f190c98c8f7d9581f68db4af021696727b2"},{"fixed":"8767f238b0e6c3d0b295ac6dce9fbe6a99bd1b9d"},{"fixed":"b17818307446c5a8d925a39a792261dbfa930041"},{"fixed":"2985712dc76dfa670eb7fd607c09d4d48e5f5c6e"},{"fixed":"03fb1708b7d1e76aecebf767ad059c319845039f"},{"fixed":"f490af47bbee02441e356a1e0b86e3b3dd5120ff"},{"fixed":"34f3ff52cb9fa7dbf04f5c734fcc4cb6ed5d1a95"}]}],"versions":["v5.11","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.127","v5.15.128","v5.15.129","v5.15.13","v5.15.130","v5.15.131","v5.15.132","v5.15.133","v5.15.134","v5.15.135","v5.15.136","v5.15.137","v5.15.138","v5.15.139","v5.15.14","v5.15.140","v5.15.141","v5.15.142","v5.15.143","v5.15.144","v5.15.145","v5.15.146","v5.15.147","v5.15.148","v5.15.149","v5.15.15","v5.15.150","v5.15.151","v5.15.152","v5.15.153","v5.15.154","v5.15.155","v5.15.156","v5.15.157","v5.15.158","v5.15.159","v5.15.16","v5.15.160","v5.15.161","v5.15.162","v5.15.163","v5.15.164","v5.15.165","v5.15.166","v5.15.167","v5.15.168","v5.15.169","v5.15.17","v5.15.170","v5.15.171","v5.15.172","v5.15.173","v5.15.174","v5.15.175","v5.15.176","v5.15.177","v5.15.178","v5.15.179","v5.15.18","v5.15.180","v5.15.181","v5.15.182","v5.15.183","v5.15.184","v5.15.185","v5.15.186","v5.15.187","v5.15.188","v5.15.189","v5.15.19","v5.15.190","v5.15.191","v5.15.192","v5.15.193","v5.15.194","v5.15.195","v5.15.196","v5.15.197","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.160","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6"

But there are cases where we could avoid revalidation.\n\nConsider:\n1  input -> j2 -> j3\n2  input -> j2 -> j3\n3  input -> j1 -> j2 -> j3\n\nThen the second rule does not need to revalidate j2, and, by extension j3,\nbecause this was already checked during validation of the first rule.\nWe need to validate it only for rule 3.\n\nThis is needed because chain loop detection also ensures we do not exceed\nthe jump stack: Just because we know that j2 is cycle free, its last jump\nmight now exceed the allowed stack size.  We also need to update all\nreachable chains with the new largest observed call depth.\n\nCare has to be taken to revalidate even if the chain depth won't be an\nissue: chain validation also ensures that expressions are not called from\ninvalid base chains.  For example, the masquerade expression can only be\ncalled from NAT postrouting base chains.\n\nTherefore we also need to keep record of the base chain context (type,\nhooknum) and revalidate if the

usb: rtl8150: fix memory leak on usb_submit_urb() failure","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: rtl8150: fix memory leak on usb_submit_urb() failure\n\nIn async_set_registers(), when usb_submit_urb() fails, the allocated\n  async_req structure and URB are not freed, causing a memory leak.\n\n  The completion callback async_set_reg_cb() is responsible for freeing\n  these allocations, but it is only called after the URB is successfully\n  submitted and completes (successfully or with error). If submission\n  fails, the callback never runs and the memory is leaked.\n\n  Fix this by freeing both the URB and the request structure in the error\n  path when usb_submit_urb()

provide locking for v4_end_grace","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: provide locking for v4_end_grace\n\nWriting to v4_end_grace can race with server shutdown and result in\nmemory being accessed after it was freed - reclaim_str_hashtbl in\nparticularly.\n\nWe cannot hold nfsd_mutex across the nfsd4_end_grace() call as that is\nheld while client_tracking_op->init() is called and that can wait for\nan upcall to nfsdcltrack which can write to v4_end_grace, resulting in a\ndeadlock.\n\nnfsd4_end_grace() is also called by the landromat work queue and this\ndoesn't require locking as server shutdown will stop the work and wait\nfor it before freeing anything that nfsd4_end_grace() might access.\n\nHowever, we must be sure that writing to v4_end_grace doesn't restart\nthe work item after shutdown has already waited for it.  For this we\nadd a new flag protected with nn->client_lock.  It is set only while it\nis safe to make client tracking calls, and v4_end_grace only schedules\nwork while the flag is set with the spinlock held.\n\nSo this patch adds a nfsd_net field \"client_tracking_active\" which is\nset as described.  Another field \"grace_end_forced\", is set when\nv4_end_grace is written.

A debug printk() patch found that a refcount is obtained at\nxdp_convert_md_to_buff() from bpf_prog_test_run_xdp().\n\nAccording to commit ec94670fcb3b (\"bpf: Support specifying ingress via\nxdp_md

Reject narrower access to pointer ctx fields","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Reject narrower access to pointer ctx fields\n\nThe following BPF program, simplified from a syzkaller repro, causes a\nkernel warning:\n\n    r0 = *(u8 *)(r1 + 169);\n    exit;\n\nWith pointer field sk being at offset 168 in __sk_buff. This access is\ndetected as a narrower read in bpf_skb_is_valid_access because it\ndoesn't match offsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk). It is therefore allowed\nand later proceeds to bpf_convert_ctx_access. Note that for the\n\"is_narrower_load\" case in the convert_ctx_accesses(), the insn->off\nis aligned, so the cnt may not be 0 because it matches the\noffsetof(struct __sk_buff, sk) in the bpf_convert_ctx_access. However,\nthe target_size stays 0 and the verifier errors with a kernel warning:\n\n    verifier bug: error during ctx access conversion(1)\n\nThis patch fixes that to return a proper \"invalid bpf_context access\noff=X size=Y\" error on the load instruction.\n\nThe same issue affects multiple other fields in context structures that\nallow narrow access.

fix.\n\nmsg_get_inq is an input field from caller to callee. Don't set it in\nthe callee, as the caller may not clear it on struct reuse.\n\nThis is a kernel-internal variant of msghdr only, and the only user\ndoes reinitialize the field. So this is not critical for that reason.\nBut it is more robust to avoid the write, and slightly simpler code.\nAnd it fixes a bug, see below.\n\nCallers set msg_get_inq to request the input queue length to be\nreturned in msg_inq. This is equivalent to but independent from the\nSO_INQ request to return that same info as a cmsg (tp->recvmsg_inq).\nTo reduce branching in the hot path the second also sets the msg_inq.\nThat is WAI.\n\nThis is a fix to commit 4d1442979e4a (\"af_unix: don't post cmsg for\nSO_INQ unless explicitly asked for\"), which fixed the inverse.\n\nAlso avoid NULL pointer dereference in unix_stream_read_generic if\nstate->msg is NULL and msg->msg_get_inq is written.

Fix RSS LUT NULL pointer crash on early ethtool operations","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nidpf: Fix RSS LUT NULL pointer crash on early ethtool operations\n\nThe RSS LUT is not initialized until the interface comes up, causing\nthe following NULL pointer crash when ethtool operations like rxhash on/off\nare performed before the interface is brought up for the first time.\n\nMove RSS LUT initialization from ndo_open to vport creation to ensure LUT\nis always available. This enables RSS configuration via ethtool before\nbringing the interface up. Simplify LUT management by maintaining all\nchanges in the driver's soft copy and programming zeros to the indirection\ntable when rxhash is disabled.

The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in

The OF path, which uses of_find_net_device_by_node(), never releases\n   the elevated refcount on the conduit's kobject. Nominally, the OF and\n   non-OF paths should result in objects having identical reference\n   counts taken, and it is already suspicious that\n   dsa_dev_to_net_device() has a put_device() call which is missing in\n   dsa_port_parse_of(), but we can actually even verify that an issue\n   exists. With CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE=y, if we run this command\n   \"before\" and \"after\" applying this patch:\n\n(unbind the conduit driver for net device eno2)\necho 0000:00:00.2 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/fsl_enetc/unbind\n\nwe see these lines in the output diff which appear only with the patch\napplied:\n\nkobject: 'eno2' (ffff002009a3a6b8): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)\nkobject: '109' (ffff0020099d59a0): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)\n\n2. After we find the conduit interface one way (OF) or another (non-OF),\n   it can get unregistered at any time, and DSA remains with a long-lived,\n   but in this case stale, cpu_dp->conduit pointer. Holding the net\n   device's underlying kobject isn't actually of much help, it just\n   prevents it from being freed (but we never need that kobject\n   directly). What helps us to prevent the net device from being\n   unregistered is the parallel netdev reference mechanism (dev_hold()\n   and dev_put()).\n\nActually we actually use that netdev tracker mechanism implicitly on\nuser ports since commit 2f1e8ea726e9 (\"net: dsa: link interfaces with\nthe DSA master to get rid of lockdep warnings\"), via netdev_upper_dev_link().\nBut time still passes at DSA switch probe time between the initial\nof_find_net_device_by_node() code and the user port creation time, time\nduring which the conduit could unregister itself and DSA wouldn't know\nabout it.\n\nSo we have to run of_find_net_device_by_node() under rtnl_lock() to\nprevent that from happening, and release the lock only with the netdev\ntracker having acquired the reference.\n\nDo we need to keep the reference until dsa_unregister_switch() /\ndsa_switch_shutdown()?\n1: Maybe yes. A switch device will still be registered even if all user\n   ports failed to probe, see commit 86f8b1c01a0a (\"net: dsa: Do not\n   make user port errors fatal\"), and the cpu_dp->conduit pointers\n   remain valid.  I haven't audited all call paths to see whether they\n   will actually use the conduit in lack of any user port, but if they\n   do, it seems safer to not rely on user ports for that reference.\n2. Definitely yes. We support changing the conduit which a user port is\n   associated to, and we can get into a situation where we've moved all\n   user ports away from a conduit, thus no longer hold any reference to\n   it via the net device tracker. But we shouldn't let it go nonetheless\n   - see the next change in relation to dsa_tree_find_first_conduit()\n   and LAG conduits which disappear.\n   We have to be prepared to return to the physical conduit, so the CPU\n   port must explicitly keep another reference to it. This is also to\n   say: the user ports and their CPU ports may not always keep a\n   reference to the same conduit net device, and both are needed.\n\nAs for the conduit's kobject for the /sys/class/net/ entry, we don't\ncare about it, we can release it as soon as we hold the net device\nobject itself.\n\nHistory and blame attribution\n-----------------------------\n\nThe code has been refactored so many times, it is very difficult to\nfollow and properly attribute a blame, but I'll try to make a short\nhistory which I hope to be correct.\n\nWe have two distinct probing paths:\n- one for OF, introduced in 2016

fix memory leak in skb_segment_list for GRO packets","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix memory leak in skb_segment_list for GRO packets\n\nWhen skb_segment_list() is called during packet forwarding, it handles\npackets that were aggregated by the GRO engine.\n\nHistorically, the segmentation logic in skb_segment_list assumes that\nindividual segments are split from a parent SKB and may need to carry\ntheir own socket memory accounting. Accordingly, the code transfers\ntruesize from the parent to the newly created segments.\n\nPrior to commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\"), this\ntruesize subtraction in skb_segment_list() was valid because fragments\nstill carry a reference to the original socket.\n\nHowever, commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\") changed\nthis behavior by ensuring that fraglist entries are explicitly\norphaned (skb->sk = NULL) to prevent illegal orphaning later in the\nstack. This change meant that the entire socket memory charge remained\nwith the head SKB, but the corresponding accounting logic in\nskb_segment_list() was never updated.\n\nAs a result, the current code unconditionally adds each fragment's\ntruesize to delta_truesize and subtracts it from the parent SKB. Since\nthe fragments are no longer charged to the socket, this subtraction\nresults in an effective under-count of memory when the head is freed.\nThis causes sk_wmem_alloc to remain non-zero, preventing socket\ndestruction and leading to a persistent memory leak.\n\nThe leak can be observed via KMEMLEAK when tearing down the networking\nenvironment:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881e6eb9100 (size 2048):\n  comm \"ping\", pid 6720, jiffies 4295492526\n  backtrace:\n    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof+0x5c6/0x800\n    sk_prot_alloc+0x5b/0x220\n    sk_alloc+0x35/0xa00\n    inet6_create.part.0+0x303/0x10d0\n    __sock_create+0x248/0x640\n    __sys_socket+0x11b/0x1d0\n\nSince skb_segment_list() is exclusively used for SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST\npackets constructed by GRO, the truesize adjustment is removed.\n\nThe call to skb_release_head_state() must be preserved. As documented in\ncommit cf673ed0e057 (\"net: fix fraglist segmentation reference count\nleak\"), it is still required to correctly drop references to SKB\nextensions that may be overwritten during

sch_qfq: Fix NULL deref when deactivating inactive aggregate in qfq_reset","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_qfq: Fix NULL deref when deactivating inactive aggregate in qfq_reset\n\n`qfq_class->leaf_qdisc->q.qlen > 0` does not imply that the class\nitself is active.\n\nTwo qfq_class objects may point to the same leaf_qdisc. This happens\nwhen:\n\n1. one QFQ qdisc is attached to the dev as the root qdisc, and\n\n2. another QFQ qdisc is temporarily referenced (e.g., via qdisc_get()\n/ qdisc_put()) and is pending to be destroyed, as in function\ntc_new_tfilter.\n\nWhen packets are enqueued through the root QFQ qdisc, the shared\nleaf_qdisc->q.qlen increases. At the same time, the second QFQ\nqdisc triggers qdisc_put and qdisc_destroy: the qdisc enters\nqfq_reset() with its own q->q.qlen == 0, but its class's leaf\nqdisc->q.qlen > 0. Therefore, the qfq_reset would wrongly deactivate\nan inactive aggregate and trigger a null-deref in qfq_deactivate_agg:\n\n[    0.903172] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:

sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sock: fix hardened usercopy panic in sock_recv_errqueue\n\nskbuff_fclone_cache was created without defining a usercopy region,\n[1] unlike skbuff_head_cache which properly whitelists the cb[] field.\n[2] This causes a usercopy BUG() when CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is\nenabled and the kernel attempts to copy sk_buff.cb data to userspace\nvia sock_recv_errqueue() -> put_cmsg().\n\nThe crash occurs when: 1. TCP allocates an skb using alloc_skb_fclone()\n   (from skbuff_fclone_cache) [1]\n2. The skb is cloned via skb_clone() using the pre-allocated fclone\n[3] 3. The cloned skb is queued to sk_error_queue for timestamp\nreporting 4. Userspace reads the error queue via recvmsg(MSG_ERRQUEUE)\n5. sock_recv_errqueue() calls put_cmsg() to copy serr->ee from skb->cb\n[4] 6. __check_heap_object() fails because skbuff_fclone_cache has no\n   usercopy whitelist [5]\n\nWhen cloned skbs allocated from skbuff_fclone_cache are used in the\nsocket error queue, accessing the sock_exterr_skb structure in skb->cb\nvia put_cmsg() triggers a usercopy hardening violation:\n\n[    5.379589] usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object 'skbuff_fclone_cache' (offset 296, size 16)!\n[    5.382796] kernel BUG at

function extracts a length field from the packet\nheader and, when FCS is disabled, subtracts 2 from this length without\nvalidating that len >= 2.\n\nIf an attacker sends a malicious packet with a length field of 0 or 1\nto an interface with FCS disabled, the subtraction causes an integer\nunderflow.\n\nThis can lead to memory exhaustion and kernel instability, potential\ninformation disclosure

Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nima: Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()\n\nIn ima_match_rules(), if ima_filter_rule_match() returns -ENOENT due to\nthe rule being NULL, the function incorrectly skips the 'if (!rc)' check\nand sets 'result = true'. The LSM rule is considered a match, causing\nextra files to be measured by IMA.\n\nThis issue can be reproduced in the following scenario:\nAfter unloading the SELinux policy module via 'semodule -d', if an IMA\nmeasurement is triggered before ima_lsm_rules is updated,\nin ima_match_rules(), the first call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns\n-ESTALE. This causes the code to enter the 'if (rc == -ESTALE &&\n!rule_reinitialized)' block, perform ima_lsm_copy_rule() and retry. In\nima_lsm_copy_rule(), since the SELinux module has been removed, the rule\nbecomes NULL, and the second call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns\n-ENOENT. This bypasses the 'if (!rc)' check and results in a false match.\n\nCall trace:\n  selinux_audit_rule_match+0x310/0x3b8\n  security_audit_rule_match+0x60/0xa0\n  ima_match_rules+0x2e4/0x4a0\n

Remove the free of\nrx_ring in rtl8180_init_rx_ring() error path, and set the freed\npriv->rx_buf entry to null, to avoid double

bit mode\n\nCommit fc96ec826bce (\"spi: fsl-cpm: Use 16 bit mode for large transfers\nwith even size\") failed to make sure that the size is really even\nbefore switching to 16 bit mode. Until recently the problem went\nunnoticed because kernfs uses a pre-allocated bounce buffer of size\nPAGE_SIZE for reading EEPROM.\n\nBut commit 8ad6249c51d0 (\"eeprom: at25: convert to spi-mem

Verify inode mode when loading from disk","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: Verify inode mode when loading from disk\n\nsyzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when\nthe S_IFMT bits of the 16bits \"mode\" field loaded from disk are corrupted.\n\nAccording to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS\n8 and 9. According to [2], the reserved field was explicitly initialized\nwith 0, and that field must remain 0 as long as reserved. Therefore, when\nthe \"mode\" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file must be\nS_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/\nS_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK if dir ==

fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain\n\nsyzbot reported a kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() because the\n`cl_next_free_rec` field of the allocation chain list (next free slot in\nthe chain list) is 0, triggring the BUG_ON(!cl->cl_next_free_rec)\ncondition in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() and panicking the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, an if condition is introduced in ocfs2_claim_suballoc_bits(),\njust before calling ocfs2_find_victim_chain(), the code block in it being\nexecuted when either of the following conditions is true:\n\n1. `cl_next_free_rec` is equal to 0, indicating that there are no free\nchains in the allocation chain list\n2. `cl_next_free_rec` is greater than `cl_count` (the total number of\nchains in the allocation chain list)\n\nEither of them being true is indicative of the fact that there are no\nchains left for usage.\n\nThis is addressed using ocfs2_error(), which prints\nthe error log for debugging purposes, rather than panicking the

Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query\n\nThe ethtool -S command operates across three ioctl calls:\nETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO for the size, ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS for the names, and\nETHTOOL_GSTATS for the values.\n\nIf the number of stats changes between these calls (e.g., due to device\nreconfiguration), userspace's buffer allocation will be incorrect,\npotentially leading to buffer overflow.\n\nDrivers are generally expected to maintain stable stat counts, but some\ndrivers (e.g., mlx5, bnx2x, bna, ksz884x) use dynamic counters, making\nthis scenario possible.\n\nSome drivers try to handle this internally:\n- bnad_get_ethtool_stats() returns early in case stats.n_stats is not\n  equal to the driver's stats count.\n- micrel/ksz884x also makes sure not to write anything beyond\n  stats.n_stats and overflow the buffer.\n\nHowever, both use stats.n_stats which is already assigned with the value\nreturned from get_sset_count(), hence won't solve the issue described\nhere.\n\nChange ethtool_get_strings(), ethtool_get_stats(),\nethtool_get_phy_stats() to not return anything in case of a mismatch\nbetween userspace's size and get_sset_size(), to prevent buffer\noverflow.\nThe returned n_stats value will be equal to zero, to reflect that\nnothing has been returned.\n\nThis could result in one of two cases when using upstream ethtool,\ndepending on when the size change is detected:\n1. When detected in ethtool_get_strings():\n    # ethtool -S eth2\n    no stats available\n\n2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.\n\nBoth cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call\nshould succeed.\n\nOther than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no\noutput/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting\nincorrect/shifted stats.\nI also considered returning an error instead of a \"silent\" response, but\nthat seems more destructive towards userspace apps.\n\nNotes:\n- This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure\n  that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more\n  predictable behavior.\n\n- RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between\n  the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.\n\n- Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that\n  these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications\n  which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,\n  to prevent any

multiq3: sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: multiq3: sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()\n\nSyzbot identified an issue [1] in multiq3_attach() that induces a\ntask timeout due to open() or COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl operations,\nspecifically, in the case of multiq3 driver.\n\nThis problem arose when syzkaller managed to craft weird configuration\noptions used to specify the number of channels in encoder subdevice.\nIf a particularly great number is passed to s->n_chan in\nmultiq3_attach() via it->options[2], then multiple calls to\nmultiq3_encoder_reset() at the end of driver-specific attach() method\nwill be running for minutes, thus blocking tasks and affected devices\nas well.\n\nWhile this issue is most likely not too dangerous for real-life\ndevices, it still makes sense to sanitize configuration inputs. Enable\na sensible limit on the number of encoder chips (4 chips max, each\nwith 2 channels) to stop this behaviour from manifesting.\n\n[1] Syzbot crash:\nINFO: task syz.2.19:6067 blocked for more than 143 seconds.\n...\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:5254 [inline]\n __schedule+0x17c4/0x4d60 kernel/sched/core.c:6862\n __schedule_loop kernel/sched/core.c:6944

delete x->tunnel as we delete x","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x\n\nThe ipcomp fallback tunnels currently get deleted (from the various\nlists and hashtables) as the last user state that needed that fallback\nis destroyed (not deleted). If a reference to that user state still\nexists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,\ntriggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining\nreferences, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 (\"xfrm: destroy xfrm_state\nsynchronously on net exit path\") is not complete.\n\nWe recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of\nskbs (commit 9b6412e6979f (\"tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we\ncurrently drop dst\")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs\nwith a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns\ndestruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the\ntime xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)\nxfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding\nfallback state.\n\nInstead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,\nthis patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the\nfallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been\ndeleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is\ndropped.\n\nA separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since\nwe're going to lock x->tunnel while x is

vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership\n\nvidtv_channel_si_init() creates a temporary list (program, service, event)\nand ownership of the memory itself is transferred to the PAT/SDT/EIT\ntables through vidtv_psi_pat_program_assign(),\nvidtv_psi_sdt_service_assign(), vidtv_psi_eit_event_assign().\n\nThe problem here is that the local pointer where the memory ownership\ntransfer was completed is not initialized to NULL. This causes the\nvidtv_psi_pmt_create_sec_for_each_pat_entry() function to fail, and\nin the flow that jumps to free_eit, the memory that was freed by\nvidtv_psi_*_table_destroy() can be accessed

fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhfsplus: fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create\n\nWhen sync() and link() are called concurrently, both threads may\nenter hfs_bnode_find() without finding the node in the hash table\nand proceed to create it.\n\nThread A:\n  hfsplus_write_inode()\n    -> hfsplus_write_system_inode()\n      -> hfs_btree_write()\n        -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)\n          -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)\n\nThread B:\n  hfsplus_create_cat()\n    -> hfs_brec_insert()\n      -> hfs_bnode_split()\n        -> hfs_bmap_alloc()\n          -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)\n            -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)\n\nIn this case, thread A creates the bnode, sets refcnt=1, and hashes it.\nThread B also tries to create the same bnode, notices it has already\nbeen inserted, drops its own instance, and uses the hashed one without\ngetting the node.\n\n```\n\n\tnode2 = hfs_bnode_findhash(tree, cnid);\n\tif (!node2) {                                 <- Thread A\n\t\thash = hfs_bnode_hash(cnid);\n\t\tnode->next_hash = tree->node_hash[hash];\n\t\ttree->node_hash[hash] = node;\n\t\ttree->node_hash_cnt++;\n\t} else {                                      <- Thread B\n\t\tspin_unlock(&tree->hash_lock);\n\t\tkfree(node);\n\t\twait_event(node2->lock_wq,\n\t\t\t!test_bit(HFS_BNODE_NEW, &node2->flags));\n\t\treturn node2;\n\t}\n```\n\nHowever, hfs_bnode_find() requires each call to take a reference.\nHere both threads end up setting refcnt=1. When they later put the node,\nthis triggers:\n\nBUG_ON(!atomic_read(&node->refcnt))\n\nIn this scenario, Thread B in fact finds the node in the hash table\nrather than creating a new one, and thus must take a reference.\n\nFix this by calling hfs_bnode_get() when reusing a bnode newly created by\nanother thread to ensure the refcount is updated correctly.\n\nA similar bug was fixed in HFS long ago in commit\na9dc087fd3c4 (\"fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create\")\nbut the same issue remained in HFS+ until

(w83791d) Convert macros to functions to avoid TOCTOU","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (w83791d) Convert macros to functions to avoid TOCTOU\n\nThe macro FAN_FROM_REG evaluates its arguments multiple times. When used\nin lockless contexts involving shared driver data, this leads to\nTime-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions, potentially\ncausing divide-by-zero errors.\n\nConvert the macro to a static function. This guarantees that arguments\nare evaluated only once (pass-by-value), preventing the race\nconditions.\n\nAdditionally, in store_fan_div, move the calculation of the minimum\nlimit inside the update lock.

packet\n(skb->len from urb->actual_length) is large enough to contain this\nheader.\n\nIf a truncated packet is received, this will lead to a buffer\nunderflow, reading memory before the start of the skb data area,\nand causing a kernel panic.\n\nAdd length checks for both rtl8187 and rtl8187b descriptor headers\nbefore attempting to access them, dropping the packet cleanly if the\ncheck

Avoid walking the Namespace if start_node is NULL","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPICA: Avoid walking the Namespace if start_node is NULL\n\nAlthough commit 0c9992315e73 (\"ACPICA: Avoid walking the ACPI Namespace\nif it is not there\") fixed the situation when both start_node and\nacpi_gbl_root_node are NULL, the Linux kernel mainline now still crashed\non Honor Magicbook 14 Pro [1].\n\nThat happens due to the access to the member of parent_node in\nacpi_ns_get_next_node().  The NULL pointer dereference will always\nhappen, no matter whether or not the start_node is equal to\nACPI_ROOT_OBJECT, so move the check of start_node being NULL\nout of the if

c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration\n\nThe Comedi low-level driver \"c6xdigio\" seems to be for a parallel port\nconnected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi\n\"attach\" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this\ndriver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by\nregistering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the\nreturn value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and\n`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi \"detach\" handler\n`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with\n`pnp_unregister_driver()`.\n\nIt is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it\ncalls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to\n`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both\ncases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it\ndoes in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be\ncalled by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if\nthe Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for\nsome other reason.)\n\nThe unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous\nsuccessful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause\n`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning \"Unexpected driver\nunregister!\".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].\n\nAlso, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at\nmodule init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching\nComedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi\ndevice being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)\n\nChange the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,\nand the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`\nnow only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change\nthe Comedi driver \"detach\" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n[1] Syzbot sample crash report:\nUnexpected driver unregister!\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5970 at drivers/base/driver.c:273

do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfsnotify: do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files\n\ninotify/fanotify do not allow users with no read access to a file to\nsubscribe to events (e.g. IN_ACCESS/IN_MODIFY), but they do allow the\nsame user to subscribe for watching events on children when the user\nhas access to the parent directory (e.g. /dev).\n\nUsers with no read access to a file but with read access to its parent\ndirectory can still stat the file and see if it was accessed/modified\nvia atime/mtime change.\n\nThe same is not true for special files (e.g. /dev/null). Users will not\ngenerally observe atime/mtime changes when other users read/write to\nspecial files, only when someone sets atime/mtime via utimensat().\n\nAlign fsnotify events with this stat behavior and do not generate\nACCESS/MODIFY events to parent watchers on read/write of special files.\nThe events are still generated to parent watchers on utimensat(). This\ncloses some side-channels that could be possibly used for information\nexfiltration [1].\n\n[1]

core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: core: Harden s32ton() against conversion to 0 bits\n\nTesting by the syzbot fuzzer showed that the HID core gets a\nshift-out-of-bounds exception when it tries to convert a 32-bit\nquantity to a 0-bit quantity.  Ideally this should never occur, but\nthere are buggy devices and some might have a report field with size\nset to zero; we shouldn't reject the report or the device just because\nof that.\n\nInstead, harden the s32ton() routine so that it returns a reasonable\nresult instead of crashing when it is called with the number of bits\nset to 0 -- the same as what snto32()

updating multicast route stats\n\nCited commit added a dedicated mutex (instead of RTNL) to protect the\nmulticast route list, so that it will not change while the driver\nperiodically traverses it in order to update the kernel about multicast\nroute stats that were queried from the device.\n\nOne instance of list entry deletion (during route replace) was missed\nand it can result in a use-after-free [1].\n\nFix by acquiring the mutex before deleting the entry from the list and\nreleasing it afterwards.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mlxsw_sp_mr_stats_update+0x4a5/0x540

ibmpex_high_low_store() function retrieves driver data using\ndev_get_drvdata() and uses it without validation.

format strings from the device firmware and\nuses them to format trace messages. Without proper validation, bad\nfirmware could provide format strings with invalid format specifiers\n(e.g., %s, %p, %n) that could lead to crashes, or other undefined\nbehavior.\n\nAdd mlx5_tracer_validate_params() to validate that all format specifiers\nin trace strings are limited to safe integer/hex formats (%x, %d, %i,\n%u, %llx, %lx, etc.).

led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbacklight: led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs\n\nLED Backlight is a consumer of one or multiple LED class devices, but\ndevlink is currently unable to create correct supplier-producer links when\nthe supplier is a class device. It creates instead a link where the\nsupplier is the parent of the expected device.\n\nOne consequence is that removal order is not correctly enforced.\n\nIssues happen for example with the following sections in a device tree\noverlay:\n\n    // An LED driver chip\n    pca9632@62 {\n        compatible = \"nxp,pca9632\";\n        reg = <0x62>;\n\n\t// ...\n\n        addon_led_pwm: led-pwm@3 {\n            reg = <3>;\n            label = \"addon:led:pwm\";\n        };\n    };\n\n    backlight-addon {\n        compatible = \"led-backlight\";\n        leds = <&addon_led_pwm>;\n        brightness-levels = <255>;\n        default-brightness-level = <255>;\n    };\n\nIn this example, the devlink should be created between the backlight-addon\n(consumer) and the pca9632@62 (supplier). Instead it is created between the\nbacklight-addon (consumer) and the parent of the pca9632@62, which is\ntypically the I2C bus adapter.\n\nOn removal of the above overlay, the LED driver can be removed before the\nbacklight device, resulting in:\n\n    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010\n    ...\n    Call trace:\n     led_put+0xe0/0x140\n     devm_led_release+0x6c/0x98\n\nAnother way to reproduce the bug without any device tree overlays is\nunbinding the LED class device (pca9632@62) before unbinding the consumer\n(backlight-addon):\n\n

Was it\ncaused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk\nwas working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to\nstarve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs.

Other ancient HCs are\nknown which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if\nit's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.\n\nThe bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports\ntens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds.

btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb\n\nThis reverts commit 98921dbd00c4e (\"Bluetooth: Use devm_kzalloc in\nbtusb.c file\").\n\nIn btusb_probe(), we use devm_kzalloc() to allocate the btusb data. This\nties the lifetime of all the btusb data to the binding of a driver to\none interface, INTF. In a driver that binds to other interfaces, ISOC\nand DIAG, this is an accident waiting to happen.\n\nThe issue is revealed in btusb_disconnect(), where

make decode_pool() more resilient against corrupted osdmaps","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibceph: make decode_pool() more resilient against corrupted osdmaps\n\nIf the osdmap is (maliciously) corrupted such that the encoded length\nof ceph_pg_pool envelope is less than what is expected for a particular\nencoding version, out-of-bounds reads may ensue because the only bounds\ncheck that is there is based on that length value.\n\nThis patch adds explicit bounds checks for each field that is decoded\nor

fix filename leak in __io_openat_prep()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: fix filename leak in __io_openat_prep()\n\n __io_openat_prep() allocates a struct filename using getname(). However,\nfor the condition of the file being installed in the fixed file table as\nwell as having O_CLOEXEC flag set, the function returns early. At that\npoint, the request doesn't have REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP flag set. Due to this,\nthe memory for the newly allocated struct filename is not cleaned up,\ncausing a memory leak.\n\nFix this by setting the REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP for the request just after the\nsuccessful getname() call, so that when the request is torn down, the\nfilename will be cleaned up, along with other resources needing cleanup.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"b9445598d8c60a1379887b957024b71343965f74"},{"fixed":"2420ef01b2e836fbc05a0a8c73a1016504eb0458"},{"fixed":"8f44c4a550570cd5903625133f938c6b51310c9b"},{"fixed":"18b99fa603d0df5e1c898699c17d3b92ddc80746"},{"fixed":"e232269d511566b1f80872256a48593acc1becf4"},{"fixed":"7fbfb85b05bc960cc50e09d03e5e562131e48d45"},{"fixed":"b14fad555302a2104948feaff70503b64c80ac01"}]}],"versions":["v5.14","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.114","v5.15.115","v5.15.116","v5.15.117","v5.15.118","v5.15.119","v5.15.12","v5.15.120","v5.15.121","v5.15.122","v5.15.123","v5.15.124","v5.15.125","v5.15.126","v5.15.127","v5.15.128","v5.15.129","v5.15.13","v5.15.130","v5.15.131","v5.15.132","v5.15.133","v5.15.134","v5.15.135","v5.15.136","v5.15.137","v5.15.138","v5.15.139","v5.15.14","v5.15.140","v5.15.141","v5.15.142","v5.15.143","v5.15.144","v5.15.145","v5.15.146","v5.15.147","v5.15.148","v5.15.149","v5.15.15","v5.15.150","v5.15.151","v5.15.152","v5.15.153","v5.15.154","v5.15.155","v5.15.156","v5.15.157","v5.15.158","v5.15.159","v5.15.16","v5.15.160","v5.15.161","v5.15.162","v5.15.163","v5.15.164","v5.15.165","v5.15.166","v5.15.167","v5.15.168","v5.15.169","v5.15.17","v5.15.170","v5.15.171","v5.15.172","v5.15.173","v5.15.174","v5.15.175","v5.15.176","v5.15.177","v5.15.178","v5.15.179","v5.15.18","v5.15.180","v5.15.181","v5.15.182","v5.15.183","v5.15.184","v5.15.185","v5.15.186","v5.15.187","v5.15.188","v5.15.189","v5.15.19","v5.15.190","v5.15.191","v5.15.192","v5.15.193","v5.15.194","v5.15.195","v5.15.196","v5.15.197","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.100","v6.1.101","v6.1.102","v6.1.103","v6.1.104","v6.1.105","v6.1.106","v6.1.107","v6.1.108","v6.1.109","v6.1.11","v6.1.110","v6.1.111","v6.1.112","v6.1.113","v6.1.114","v6.1.115","v6.1.116","v6.1.117","v6.1.118","v6.1.119","v6.1.12","v6.1.120","v6.1.121","v6.1.122","v6.1.123","v6.1.124","v6.1.125","v6.1.126","v6.1.127","v6.1.128","v6.1.129","v6.1.13","v6.1.130","v6.1.131","v6.1.132","v6.1.133","v6.1.134","v6.1.135","v6.1.136","v6.1.137","v6.1.138","v6.1.139","v6.1.14","v6.1.140","v6.1.141","v6.1.142","v6.1.143","v6.1.144","v6.1.145","v6.1.146","v6.1.147","v6.1.148","v6.1.149","v6.1.15","v6.1.150","v6.1.151","v6.1.152","v6.1.153","v6.1.154","v6.1.155","v6.1.156","v6.1.157","v6.1.158","v6.1.159","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.31","v6.1.32","v6.1.33","v6.1.34","v6.1.35","v6.1.36","v6.1.37","v6.1.38","v6.1.39","v6.1.4","v6.1.40","v6.1.41","v6.1.42","v6.1.43","v6.1.44","v6.1.45","v6.1.46","v6.1.47","v6.1.48","v6.1.49","v6.1.5","v6.1.50","v6.1.51","v6.1.52","v6.1.53","v6.1.54","v6.1.55","v6.1.56","v6.1.57","v6.1.58","v6.1.59","v6.1.6","v6.1.60","v6.1.61","v6.1.62","v6.1.63","v6.1.64","v6.1.65","v6.1.66","v6.1.67","v6.1.68","v6.1.69","v6.1.7","v6.1.70","v6.1.71","v6.1.72","v6.1.73","v6.1.74","v6.1.75","v6.1.76","v6.1.77","v6.1.78","v6.1.79","v6.1.8","v6.1.80","v6.1.81","v6.1.82","v6.1.83","v6.1.84","v6.1.85","v6.1.86","v6.1.87","v6.1.88","v6.1.89","v6.1.9

spectrum_router: Fix neighbour use-after-free","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix neighbour use-after-free\n\nWe sometimes observe use-after-free when dereferencing a neighbour [1].\nThe problem seems to be that the driver stores a pointer to the\nneighbour, but without holding a reference on it. A reference is only\ntaken when the neighbour is used by a nexthop.\n\nFix by simplifying the reference counting scheme. Always take a\nreference when storing a neighbour pointer in a neighbour entry. Avoid\ntaking a referencing when the neighbour is used by a nexthop as the\nneighbour entry associated with the nexthop already holds a reference.\n\nTested by running the test that uncovered the problem over 300 times.\nWithout this patch the problem was reproduced after a handful of\niterations.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mlxsw_sp_neigh_entry_update+0x2d4/0x310\nRead of size

tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling\n\nWhen the CPU that the QSPI interrupt handler runs on (typically CPU 0)\nis excessively busy, it can lead to rare cases of the IRQ thread not\nrunning before the transfer timeout is reached.\n\nWhile handling the timeouts, any pending transfers are cleaned up and\nthe message that they correspond to is marked as failed, which leaves\nthe curr_xfer field pointing at stale memory.\n\nTo avoid this, clear curr_xfer to NULL upon timeout and check for this\ncondition when the IRQ thread is finally run.\n\nWhile at it, also make sure to clear interrupts on failure so that new\ninterrupts can be run.\n\nA better, more involved, fix would move the interrupt clearing into a\nhard IRQ handler. Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ\nthread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the\nextra check for a valid

enabled, queue_id != 0, in qom_list\n2) Port gets disabled\n        -> team_port_disable()\n        -> team_queue_override_port_del()\n        -> del (removed from list)\n3) Port is disabled, queue_id != 0, not in any list\n4) Priority changes\n        -> team_queue_override_port_prio_changed()\n        -> checks: port disabled && queue_id != 0\n        -> calls del - hits the BUG as it is removed

x86: Fix VM hard lockup after prolonged inactivity with periodic HV timer","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: Fix VM hard lockup after prolonged inactivity with periodic HV timer\n\nWhen advancing the target expiration for the guest's APIC timer in periodic\nmode, set the expiration to \"now\" if the target expiration is in the past\n(similar to what is done in update_target_expiration()).  Blindly adding\nthe period to the previous target expiration can result in KVM generating\na practically unbounded number of hrtimer IRQs due to programming an\nexpired timer over and over.  In extreme scenarios, e.g. if userspace\npauses/suspends a VM for an extended duration, this can even cause hard\nlockups in the host.\n\nCurrently, the bug only affects Intel CPUs when using the hypervisor timer\n(HV timer), a.k.a. the VMX preemption timer.  Unlike the software timer,\na.k.a. hrtimer, which KVM keeps running even on exits to userspace, the\nHV timer only runs while the guest is active.  As a result, if the vCPU\ndoes not run for an extended duration, there will be a huge gap between\nthe target expiration and the current time the vCPU resumes running.\nBecause the target expiration is incremented by only one period on each\ntimer expiration, this leads to a series of timer expirations occurring\nrapidly after the vCPU/VM resumes.\n\nMore critically, when the vCPU first triggers a periodic HV timer\nexpiration after resuming, advancing the expiration by only one period\nwill result in a target expiration in the past.  As a result, the delta\nmay be calculated as a negative value.  When the delta is converted into\nan absolute value (tscdeadline is an unsigned u64), the resulting value\ncan overflow what the HV timer is capable of programming.  I.e. the large\nvalue will exceed the VMX Preemption Timer's maximum bit width of\ncpu_preemption_timer_multi + 32, and thus cause KVM to switch from the\nHV timer to the software timer (hrtimers).\n\nAfter switching to the software timer, periodic timer expiration callbacks\nmay be executed consecutively within a single clock interrupt handler,\nbecause hrtimers honors KVM's request for an expiration in the past and\nimmediately re-invokes KVM's callback after reprogramming.  And because\nthe interrupt handler runs with IRQs disabled, restarting KVM's hrtimer\nover and over until the target expiration is advanced to \"now\" can result\nin a hard lockup.\n\nE.g. the following hard lockup was triggered in the host when running a\nWindows VM (only relevant because it used the APIC timer in periodic mode)\nafter resuming the VM from a long suspend (in the host).\n\n  NMI watchdog: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on cpu 45\n  ...\n  RIP: 0010:advance_periodic_target_expiration+0x4d/0x80 [kvm]\n  ...\n  RSP: 0018:ff4f88f5d98d8ef0 EFLAGS: 00000046\n  RAX: fff0103f91be678e RBX: fff0103f91be678e RCX: 00843a7d9e127bcc\n  RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0052ca4003697505 RDI: ff440d5bfbdbd500\n  RBP: ff440d5956f99200 R08: ff2ff2a42deb6a84 R09: 000000000002a6c0\n  R10: 0122d794016332b3 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ff440db1af39cfc0\n  R13: ff440db1af39cfc0 R14: ffffffffc0d4a560 R15: ff440db1af39d0f8\n  FS:  00007f04a6ffd700(0000) GS:ff440db1af380000(0000) knlGS:000000e38a3b8000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 000000d5651feff8 CR3: 000000684e038002 CR4: 0000000000773ee0\n  PKRU: 55555554\n  Call Trace:\n   <IRQ>\n   apic_timer_fn+0x31/0x50 [kvm]\n   __hrtimer_run_queues+0x100/0x280\n   hrtimer_interrupt+0x100/0x210\n   ? ttwu_do_wakeup+0x19/0x160\n   smp_apic_timer_interrupt+0x6a/0x130\n   apic_timer_interrupt+0xf/0x20\n   </IRQ>\n\nMoreover, if the suspend duration of the virtual machine is not long enough\nto trigger a hard lockup in this scenario, since commit 98c25ead5eda\n(\"KVM: VMX: Move preemption timer <=> hrtimer dance to common x86\"), KVM\nwill continue using the software timer until the guest reprograms the APIC\ntimer in some way.

fix off-by-one issues in iavf_config_rss_reg()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niavf: fix off-by-one issues in iavf_config_rss_reg()\n\nThere are off-by-one bugs when configuring RSS hash key and lookup\ntable, causing out-of-bounds reads to memory [1] and out-of-bounds\nwrites to device registers.\n\nBefore commit 43a3d9ba34c9 (\"i40evf: Allow PF driver to configure RSS\"),\nthe loop upper bounds were:\n    i <= I40E_VFQF_{HKEY,HLUT}_MAX_INDEX\nwhich is safe since the value is the last valid index.\n\nThat commit changed the bounds to:\n    i <= adapter->rss_{key,lut}_size / 4\nwhere `rss_{key,lut}_size / 4` is the number of dwords, so the last\nvalid index is `(rss_{key,lut}_size / 4) - 1`. Therefore, using `<=`\naccesses one element past the end.\n\nFix the issues by using `<` instead of `<=`, ensuring we do not exceed\nthe bounds.\n\n[1] KASAN splat about rss_key_size off-by-one\n

BUG() in pskb_expand_head() as part of calipso_skbuff_setattr()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: BUG() in pskb_expand_head() as part of calipso_skbuff_setattr()\n\nThere exists a kernel oops caused by a BUG_ON(nhead < 0) at\nnet/core/skbuff.c:2232 in pskb_expand_head().\nThis bug is triggered as part of the calipso_skbuff_setattr()\nroutine when skb_cow() is passed headroom > INT_MAX\n(i.e. (int)(skb_headroom(skb) + len_delta) < 0).\n\nThe root cause of the bug is due to an implicit integer cast in\n__skb_cow(). The check (headroom > skb_headroom(skb)) is meant to ensure\nthat delta = headroom - skb_headroom(skb) is never negative, otherwise\nwe will trigger a BUG_ON in pskb_expand_head(). However, if\nheadroom > INT_MAX and delta <= -NET_SKB_PAD, the check passes, delta\nbecomes negative, and pskb_expand_head() is passed a negative value for\nnhead.\n\nFix the trigger condition in calipso_skbuff_setattr(). Avoid passing\n\"negative\" headroom sizes to skb_cow() within calipso_skbuff_setattr()\nby only using skb_cow() to grow headroom.\n\nPoC:\n\tUsing `netlabelctl` tool:\n\n        netlabelctl map del

defer config put in recv_work","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnbd: defer config put in recv_work\n\nThere is one uaf issue in recv_work when running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK and\nNBD_CMD_RECONFIGURE:\n  nbd_genl_connect     // conf_ref=2 (connect and recv_work A)\n  nbd_open\t       // conf_ref=3\n  recv_work A done     // conf_ref=2\n  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK

atomic_dec(&config->recv_threads); -> UAF\n\nOr only running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK:\n  nbd_genl_connect   // conf_ref=2\n  nbd_open \t     // conf_ref=3\n  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK     // conf_ref=2\n  close nbd\n

before notifying the\nwaiter\") moved nbd_config_put() to run before waking up the waiter in\nrecv_work, in order to ensure that nbd_start_device_ioctl() would not\nbe woken up while nbd->task_recv was still uncleared.\n\nHowever, in nbd_start_device_ioctl(), after being woken up it explicitly\ncalls flush_workqueue() to make sure all current works are finished.\nTherefore, there is no need to move the config put ahead of the wakeup.\n\nMove nbd_config_put() to the end of recv_work, so that the reference is\nheld for the whole lifetime of the worker thread. This makes sure the\nconfig cannot be freed while recv_work is still running, even if clear\n+ reconfigure interleave.\n\nIn addition, we don't need to worry about recv_work dropping the last\nnbd_put (which causes deadlock):\n\npath A (netlink with NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):\n  connect  // nbd_refs=1 (trigger recv_work)\n  open nbd // nbd_refs=2\n  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK\n  close nbd\n    nbd_release\n      nbd_disconnect_and_put\n        flush_workqueue // recv_work done\n      nbd_config_put\n        nbd_put // nbd_refs=1\n      nbd_put // nbd_refs=0\n        queue_work\n\npath B

16b269436b72 (\"sched/deadline: Modify cpudl::free_cpus\nto reflect rd->online\") introduced the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu\nfunctions to allow the cpu_dl::free_cpus mask to be manipulated\nby the deadline scheduler class rq_on/offline callbacks so the\nmask would also reflect this state.\n\nCommit 9659e1eeee28 (\"sched/deadline: Remove cpu_active_mask\nfrom cpudl_find()\") removed the check of the cpu_active_mask to\nsave some processing on the premise that the cpudl::free_cpus\nmask already reflected the runqueue online state.\n\nUnfortunately, there are cases where it is possible for the\ncpudl_clear function to set the free_cpus bit for a CPU when the\ndeadline runqueue is offline. When this occurs while a CPU is\nconnected to the default root domain the flag may retain the bad\nstate after the CPU has been unplugged. Later, a different CPU\nthat is transitioning through the default root domain may push a\ndeadline task to the powered down CPU when cpudl_find sees its\nfree_cpus bit is set. If this happens the task will not have the\nopportunity to run.\n\nOne example is outlined here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250110233010.2339521-1-opendmb@gmail.com\n\nAnother occurs when the last deadline task is migrated from a\nCPU that has an offlined runqueue. The dequeue_task member of\nthe deadline scheduler class will eventually call cpudl_clear\nand set the free_cpus bit for the CPU.\n\nThis commit modifies the cpudl_clear function to be aware of the\nonline state of the deadline runqueue so that the free_cpus mask\ncan be updated appropriately.\n\nIt is no longer necessary to manage the mask outside of the\ncpudl_set/clear functions so the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu\nfunctions are removed.

openvswitch: fix middle attribute validation in push_nsh() action","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: openvswitch: fix middle attribute validation in push_nsh() action\n\nThe push_nsh() action structure looks like this:\n\n OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PUSH_NSH(OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH(OVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE,...))\n\nThe outermost OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PUSH_NSH attribute is OK'ed by the\nnla_for_each_nested() inside __ovs_nla_copy_actions().  The innermost\nOVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE/MD1/MD2 are OK'ed by the nla_for_each_nested()\ninside nsh_key_put_from_nlattr().  But nothing checks if the attribute\nin the middle is OK.  We don't even check that this attribute is the\nOVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH.  We just do a double unwrap with a pair of nla_data()\ncalls - first time directly while calling validate_push_nsh() and the\nsecond time as part of the nla_for_each_nested() macro, which isn't\nsafe, potentially causing invalid memory access if the size of this\nattribute is incorrect.  The failure may not be noticed during\nvalidation due to larger netlink buffer, but cause trouble later during\naction execution where the buffer is allocated exactly to the size:\n\n BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in nsh_hdr_from_nlattr+0x1dd/0x6a0 [openvswitch]\n Read of size 184 at addr ffff88816459a634 by task a.out/22624\n\n CPU: 8 UID: 0 PID: 22624 6.18.0-rc7+ #115 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  dump_stack_lvl+0x51/0x70\n  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x2c/0x390\n  kasan_report+0xdd/0x110\n  kasan_check_range+0x35/0x1b0\n  __asan_memcpy+0x20/0x60\n  nsh_hdr_from_nlattr+0x1dd/0x6a0 [openvswitch]\n  push_nsh+0x82/0x120 [openvswitch]\n  do_execute_actions+0x1405/0x2840 [openvswitch]\n  ovs_execute_actions+0xd5/0x3b0 [openvswitch]\n  ovs_packet_cmd_execute+0x949/0xdb0 [openvswitch]\n  genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0x1d6/0x2b0\n  genl_family_rcv_msg+0x336/0x580\n  genl_rcv_msg+0x9f/0x130\n  netlink_rcv_skb+0x11f/0x370\n  genl_rcv+0x24/0x40\n  netlink_unicast+0x73e/0xaa0\n  netlink_sendmsg+0x744/0xbf0\n  __sys_sendto+0x3d6/0x450\n  do_syscall_64+0x79/0x2c0\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n  </TASK>\n\nLet's add some checks that the attribute is properly sized and it's\nthe only one attribute inside the action.  Technically, there is no\nreal reason for OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH to be there, as we know that we're\npushing an NSH header already, it just creates extra nesting, but\nthat's how uAPI works today.  So, keeping as it

mac80211: Discard Beacon frames to non-broadcast address","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: Discard Beacon frames to non-broadcast address\n\nBeacon frames are required to be sent to the broadcast address, see IEEE\nStd 802.11-2020, 11.1.3.1 (\"The Address 1 field of the Beacon .. frame\nshall be set to the broadcast address\"). A unicast Beacon frame might be\nused as a targeted attack to get one of the associated STAs to do\nsomething (e.g., using CSA to move it to another channel). As such, it\nis better have strict filtering for this on the received side and\ndiscard all Beacon frames that are sent to an unexpected address.\n\nThis is even more important for cases where beacon protection is used.\nThe current implementation in mac80211 is correctly discarding unicast\nBeacon frames if the Protected Frame bit in the Frame Control field is\nset to 0. However, if that bit is set to 1, the logic used for checking\nfor configured BIGTK(s) does not actually work. If the driver does not\nhave logic for dropping unicast Beacon frames with Protected Frame bit\n1, these frames would be accepted in mac80211 processing as valid Beacon\nframes even though they are not protected. This would allow beacon\nprotection to be bypassed. While the logic for checking beacon\nprotection could be extended to cover this corner case, a more generic\ncheck for discard all Beacon frames based on A1=unicast address covers\nthis without needing additional changes.\n\nAddress all these issues by dropping received Beacon frames if they are\nsent to a non-broadcast

invalidate dentry cache on failed whiteout creation","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: invalidate dentry cache on failed whiteout creation\n\nF2FS can mount filesystems with corrupted directory depth values that\nget runtime-clamped to MAX_DIR_HASH_DEPTH. When RENAME_WHITEOUT\noperations are performed on such directories, f2fs_rename performs\ndirectory modifications (updating target entry and deleting source\nentry) before attempting to add the whiteout entry via f2fs_add_link.\n\nIf f2fs_add_link fails due to the corrupted directory structure, the\nfunction returns an error to VFS, but the partial directory\nmodifications have already been committed to disk. VFS assumes the\nentire rename operation failed and does not update the dentry cache,\nleaving stale mappings.\n\nIn the error path, VFS does not call d_move() to update the dentry\ncache. This results in new_dentry still pointing to the old inode\n(new_inode) which has already had its i_nlink decremented to zero.\nThe stale cache causes subsequent operations to incorrectly reference\nthe freed inode.\n\nThis causes subsequent operations to use cached dentry information that\nno longer matches the on-disk state. When a second rename targets the\nsame entry, VFS attempts to decrement i_nlink on the stale inode, which\nmay already have i_nlink=0, triggering a WARNING in drop_nlink().\n\nExample sequence:\n1. First rename (RENAME_WHITEOUT): file2 → file1\n   - f2fs updates file1 entry on disk (points to inode 8)\n   - f2fs deletes file2 entry on disk\n   - f2fs_add_link(whiteout) fails (corrupted directory)\n   - Returns error to VFS\n   - VFS does not call d_move() due to error\n   - VFS cache still has: file1 → inode 7 (stale!)\n   - inode 7 has i_nlink=0 (already decremented)\n\n2. Second rename: file3 → file1\n   - VFS uses stale cache: file1 → inode 7\n   - Tries to drop_nlink on inode 7 (i_nlink already 0)\n   - WARNING in drop_nlink()\n\nFix this by explicitly invalidating old_dentry and new_dentry when\nf2fs_add_link fails during whiteout creation. This forces VFS to\nrefresh from disk on subsequent operations, ensuring cache consistency\neven when the rename partially succeeds.\n\nReproducer:\n1.
