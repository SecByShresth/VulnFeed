The peculiar thing about this is that TUR\n   is not reading from the device.\n2) In sg_start_req() the invocation of blk_rq_map_user() effectively\n   bounces the user-space buffer. As if the device was to transfer into\n   it. Since commit a45b599ad808 (\"scsi: sg: allocate with __GFP_ZERO in\n   sg_build_indirect()\") we make sure this first bounce buffer is\n   allocated with GFP_ZERO.\n3) For the rest of the story we keep ignoring that we have a TUR, so the\n   device won't touch the buffer we prepare as if the we had a\n   DMA_FROM_DEVICE type of situation. My setup uses a virtio-scsi device\n   and the  buffer allocated by SG is mapped by the function\n   virtqueue_add_split() which uses DMA_FROM_DEVICE for the \"in\" sgs (here\n   scatter-gather and not scsi generics). This mapping involves bouncing\n   via the swiotlb (we need swiotlb to do virtio in protected guest like\n   s390 Secure Execution, or AMD SEV).\n4) When the SCSI TUR is done, we first copy back the content of the second\n   (that is swiotlb) bounce buffer (which most likely contains some\n   previous IO data), to the first bounce buffer, which contains all\n   zeros.  Then we copy back the content of the first bounce buffer to\n   the user-space buffer.\n5) The test case detects that the buffer, which it zero-initialized,\n  ain't all zeros and fails.\n\nOne can argue that this is an swiotlb problem, because without swiotlb\nwe leak all zeros, and the swiotlb should be transparent in a sense that\nit does not affect the outcome (if all other participants are well\nbehaved).\n\nCopying the content of the original buffer into the swiotlb buffer is\nthe only way I can think of to make swiotlb transparent in such\nscenarios. So let's do just that if in doubt, but allow the driver\nto tell us that the whole mapped buffer is going to be overwritten,\nin which case we can preserve the old behavior and avoid the

fix xattr related buffer overflow...","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\norangefs: fix xattr related buffer overflow...\n\nWilly Tarreau <w@1wt.eu> forwarded me a message from\nDisclosure <disclosure@aisle.com> with the following\nwarning:\n\n> The helper `xattr_key()` uses the pointer variable in the loop condition\n> rather than dereferencing it. As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL\n> (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on\n> valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging\n> the thread.\n\nI easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel\noops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure\nsent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based\nthis patch on.\n\nAfter xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an\nxattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns\na hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs\nused hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using\nhash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong\nhash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a\ngetattr for the xattr \"security.capability\" every time. Orangefs\nnegative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the\nxattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for\n\"security.capability\" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were\never freed.\n\nI changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead\nand the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing

Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer\n\nPrior to LLVM 15.0.0, LLVM's integrated assembler would incorrectly\nbyte-swap NOP when compiling for big-endian, and the resulting series of\nbytes happened to match the encoding of FNMADD S21, S30, S0, S0.\n\nThis went unnoticed until commit:\n\n  34f66c4c4d5518c1 (\"arm64: Use a positive cpucap for FP/SIMD\")\n\nPrior to that commit, the kernel would always enable the use of FPSIMD\nearly in boot when __cpu_setup() initialized CPACR_EL1, and so usage of\nFNMADD within the kernel was not detected, but could result in the\ncorruption of user or kernel FPSIMD state.\n\nAfter that commit, the instructions happen to trap during boot prior to\nFPSIMD being detected and enabled, e.g.\n\n| Unhandled 64-bit el1h sync exception on CPU0, ESR 0x000000001fe00000 -- ASIMD\n| CPU: 0

missing CPU entry\n\nIn a review discussion of the changes to support vCPU hotplug where\na check was added on the GICC being enabled if was online, it was\nnoted that there is need to map back to the cpu and use that to index\ninto a cpumask. As such, a valid ID is needed.\n\nIf an MPIDR check fails in acpi_map_gic_cpu_interface() it is possible\nfor the entry in cpu_madt_gicc[cpu] == NULL.

vGICv3\n\nOn a system with a GICv3, if a guest hasn't been configured with\nGICv3 and that the host is not capable of GICv2 emulation,\na write to any of the ICC_*SGI*_EL1 registers is trapped to

translation cache\n\nThere is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation\ncache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such\nas a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that\nvgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq\nbefore dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.\n\nHave vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq\nand add the corresponding decrement after queueing the

Note only does this leak the corresponding\nmemory when the vCPU is destroyed but it can also lead to use-after-free\nif the redistributor device handling tries to walk into the vCPU.\n\nAdd the

unprivileged load workaround\n\nImplement the workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298. On an\naffected Cortex-A520 core, a speculatively executed unprivileged load\nmight leak data from a privileged load via a cache side channel. The\nissue only exists for loads within a translation regime with the same\ntranslation (e.g. same ASID and VMID). Therefore, the issue only affects\nthe return to EL0.\n\nThe workaround is to execute a TLBI before returning to EL0 after all\nloads of privileged data. A non-shareable TLBI to any address is\nsufficient.\n\nThe workaround isn't necessary if page table isolation (KPTI) is\nenabled, but for simplicity it will be. Page table isolation should\nnormally be disabled for Cortex-A520 as it supports the CSV3 feature\nand the E0PD feature (used when KASLR is

mt7921: don't assume adequate headroom for SDIO headers","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmt76: mt7921: don't assume adequate headroom for SDIO headers\n\nmt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() calls mt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() and\nmt7921_skb_add_usb_sdio_hdr(), both of which blindly assume that\nadequate headroom will be available in the passed skb. This assumption\ntypically is satisfied when the skb was allocated in the net core for\ntransmission via the mt7921 netdev (although even that is only an\noptimization and is not strictly guaranteed), but the assumption is\nsometimes not satisfied when the skb originated in the receive path of\nanother netdev and was passed through to the mt7921, such as by the\nbridge layer. Blindly prepending bytes to an skb is always wrong.\n\nThis commit introduces a call to skb_cow_head() before the call to\nmt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() in mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() to\nensure that at least MT_SDIO_TXD_SIZE + MT_SDIO_HDR_SIZE bytes can be\npushed onto the skb.\n\nWithout this fix, I can trivially cause kernel panics by bridging an\nMT7921AU-based USB 802.11ax interface with an Ethernet interface on an\nIntel Atom-based x86 system using its onboard RTL8169 PCI Ethernet\nadapter and also on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi 1 using its onboard\nSMSC9512 USB Ethernet adapter. Note that the panics do not occur in\nevery system configuration, as they occur only if the receiving netdev\nleaves less headroom in its received skbs than the mt7921 needs for its\nSDIO headers.\n\nHere is an example stack trace of this panic on Raspberry Pi OS Lite\n2023-02-21 running kernel 6.1.24+ [1]:\n\n skb_panic from skb_push+0x44/0x48\n skb_push from

root cause is, inodeA references inodeB via inodeB's ino, once inodeA\nis truncated, it calls truncate_dnode() to truncate data blocks in inodeB's\nnode page, it traverse mapping data from node->i.i_addr[0] to\nnode->i.i_addr[ADDRS_PER_BLOCK() - 1], result in out-of-boundary access.\n\nThis patch fixes to add sanity check on dnode page in truncate_dnode(),\nso that, it can help to avoid

data.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"6211753fdfd05af9e08f54c8d0ba3ee516034878"},{"fixed":"3d16cebf01127f459dcfeb79ed77bd68b124c228"},{"fixed":"3ab1c40a1e915e350d9181a4603af393141970cc"},{"fixed":"10c02aad111df02088d1a81792a709f6a7eca6cc"}]}],"versions":["v3.10","v3.10-rc5","v3.10-rc6","v3.10-rc7","v3.11","v3.11-rc1","v3.11-rc2","v3.11-rc3","v3.11-rc4","v3.11-rc5","v3.11-rc6","v3.11-rc7","v3.12","v3.12-rc1","v3.12-rc2","v3.12-rc3","v3.12-rc4","v3.12-rc5","v3.12-rc6","v3.12-rc7","v3.13","v3.13-rc1","v3.13-rc2","v3.13-rc3","v3.13-rc4","v3.13-rc5","v3.13-rc6","v3.13-rc7","v3.13-rc8","v3.14","v3.14-rc1","v3.14-rc2","v3.14-rc3","v3.14-rc4","v3.14-rc5","v3.14-rc6","v3.14-rc7","v3.14-rc8","v3.15","v3.15-rc1","v3.15-rc2","v3.15-rc3","v3.15-rc4","v3.15-rc5","v3.15-rc6","v3.15-rc7","v3.15-rc8","v3.16","v3.16-rc1","v3.16-rc2","v3.16-rc3","v3.16-rc4","v3.16-rc5","v3.16-rc6","v3.16-rc7","v3.17","v3.17-rc1","v3.17-rc2","v3.17-rc3","v3.17-rc4","v3.17-rc5","v3.17-rc6","v3.17-rc7","v3.18","v3.18-rc1","v3.18-rc2","v3.18-rc3","v3.18-rc4","v3.18-rc5","v3.18-rc6","v3.18-rc7","v3.19","v3.19-rc1","v3.19-rc2","v3.19-rc3","v3.19-rc4","v3.19-rc5","v3.19-rc6","v3.19-rc7","v4.0","v4.0-rc1","v4.0-rc2","v4.0-rc3","v4.0-rc4","v4.0-rc5","v4.0-rc6","v4.0-rc7","v4.1","v4.1-rc1","v4.1-rc2","v4.1-rc3","v4.1-rc4","v4.1-rc5","v4.1-rc6","v4.1-rc7","v4.1-rc8","v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.2","v4.2-rc1","v4.2-rc2","v4.2-rc3","v4.2-rc4","v4.2-rc5","v4.2-rc6","v4.2-rc7","v4.2-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.3","v4.3-rc1","v4.3-rc2","v4.3-rc3","v4.3-rc4","v4.3-rc5","v4.3-rc6","v4.3-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc1","v4.4-rc2","v4.4-rc3","v4.4-rc4","v4.4-rc5","v4.4-rc6","v4.4-rc7","v4.4-rc8","v4.5","v4.5-rc1","v4.5-rc2","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6-rc6","v4.6-rc7","v4.7","v4.7-rc1","v4.7-rc2","v4.7-rc3","v4.7-rc4","v4.7-rc5","v4.7-rc6","v4.7-rc7","v4.8","v4.8-rc1","v4.8-rc2","v4.8-rc3","v4.8-rc4","v4.8-rc5","v4.8-rc6","v4.8-rc7","v4.8-rc8","v4.9","v4.9-rc1","v4.9-rc2","v4.9-rc3","v4.9-rc4","v4.9-rc5","v4.9-rc6","v4.9-rc7","v4.9-rc8","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc

the scenario:\n - Userspace creates a VM and a vCPU.\n - The vCPU is initialized with KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 during\n   KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT.\n - Without any other setup, such as vGIC or vPMU, userspace issues\n   KVM_RUN on the vCPU. Since the vPMU is requested, but not setup,\n   kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable() fails in kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change().\n   As a result, KVM_RUN returns after enabling the timer, but before\n   incrementing 'userspace_irqchip_in_use':\n   kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change()\n       ret = kvm_arm_pmu_v3_enable()\n           if (!vcpu->arch.pmu.created)\n               return -EINVAL;\n       if (ret)\n           return ret;\n       [...]\n       if (!irqchip_in_kernel(kvm))\n           static_branch_inc(&userspace_irqchip_in_use);\n - Userspace ignores the error and issues KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT again.\n   Since the timer is already enabled, control moves through the\n   following flow, ultimately hitting the WARN_ON():\n   kvm_timer_vcpu_reset()\n       if (timer->enabled)\n          kvm_timer_update_irq()\n              if (!userspace_irqchip())\n                  ret = kvm_vgic_inject_irq()\n                      ret = vgic_lazy_init()\n                          if (unlikely(!vgic_initialized(kvm)))\n                              if (kvm->arch.vgic.vgic_model !=\n                                  KVM_DEV_TYPE_ARM_VGIC_V2)\n                                      return -EBUSY;\n

Fix NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in VRAM logic for APU devices\n\nPreviously, APU platforms (and other scenarios with uninitialized VRAM managers)\ntriggered a NULL pointer dereference in `ttm_resource_manager_usage()`. The root\ncause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,\nbut that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains\nuninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully\nset up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to\nacquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`, leading to\na kernel OOPS.\n\n1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth control check in\n   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for\n   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized\n   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific\n   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.\n\n2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info\n   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real VRAM\n   usage; otherwise, return 0. This avoids accessing `man->bdev` when it is\n   NULL.\n\n3. **amdgpu_virt.c**: Modify the vf2pf (virtual function to physical function)\n   data write path. Use `ttm_resource_manager_used()` to check validity: if the\n   manager is usable, calculate `fb_usage` from VRAM usage; otherwise, set\n   `fb_usage` to 0 (APUs have no discrete framebuffer to report).\n\nThis approach is more robust than APU-specific checks because it:\n- Works for all scenarios where the VRAM manager is uninitialized (not just APUs),\n- Aligns with TTM's design by using its native helper function,\n- Preserves correct behavior for discrete GPUs (which have fully initialized\n  `man->bdev` and pass the `ttm_resource_manager_used()` check).\n\nv4: use

cdns3: gadget: Use-after-free during failed initialization and exit of cdnsp gadget","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: cdns3: gadget: Use-after-free during failed initialization and exit of cdnsp gadget\n\nIn the __cdnsp_gadget_init() and cdnsp_gadget_exit() functions, the gadget\nstructure (pdev->gadget) was freed before its endpoints.\nThe endpoints are linked via the ep_list in the gadget structure.\nFreeing the gadget first leaves dangling pointers in the endpoint list.\nWhen the endpoints are subsequently freed, this

this\nbug.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"4a488a7ad71401169cecee75dc94bcce642e2c53"},{"fixed":"e2105ba1c262dcaa9573f11844b6e1e1ca762c3f"},{"fixed":"f7569ef1cf978aa87aa81b5e9bf40a77497f3685"},{"fixed":"7574f30337e19045f03126b4c51f525b84e5049e"}]}],"versions":["v3.18","v3.18-rc5","v3.18-rc6","v3.18-rc7","v3.19","v3.19-rc1","v3.19-rc2","v3.19-rc3","v3.19-rc4","v3.19-rc5","v3.19-rc6","v3.19-rc7","v4.0","v4.0-rc1","v4.0-rc2","v4.0-rc3","v4.0-rc4","v4.0-rc5","v4.0-rc6","v4.0-rc7","v4.1","v4.1-rc1","v4.1-rc2","v4.1-rc3","v4.1-rc4","v4.1-rc5","v4.1-rc6","v4.1-rc7","v4.1-rc8","v4.10","v4.10-rc1","v4.10-rc2","v4.10-rc3","v4.10-rc4","v4.10-rc5","v4.10-rc6","v4.10-rc7","v4.10-rc8","v4.11","v4.11-rc1","v4.11-rc2","v4.11-rc3","v4.11-rc4","v4.11-rc5","v4.11-rc6","v4.11-rc7","v4.11-rc8","v4.12","v4.12-rc1","v4.12-rc2","v4.12-rc3","v4.12-rc4","v4.12-rc5","v4.12-rc6","v4.12-rc7","v4.13","v4.13-rc1","v4.13-rc2","v4.13-rc3","v4.13-rc4","v4.13-rc5","v4.13-rc6","v4.13-rc7","v4.14","v4.14-rc1","v4.14-rc2","v4.14-rc3","v4.14-rc4","v4.14-rc5","v4.14-rc6","v4.14-rc7","v4.14-rc8","v4.15","v4.15-rc1","v4.15-rc2","v4.15-rc3","v4.15-rc4","v4.15-rc5","v4.15-rc6","v4.15-rc7","v4.15-rc8","v4.15-rc9","v4.16","v4.16-rc1","v4.16-rc2","v4.16-rc3","v4.16-rc4","v4.16-rc5","v4.16-rc6","v4.16-rc7","v4.17","v4.17-rc1","v4.17-rc2","v4.17-rc3","v4.17-rc4","v4.17-rc5","v4.17-rc6","v4.17-rc7","v4.18","v4.18-rc1","v4.18-rc2","v4.18-rc3","v4.18-rc4","v4.18-rc5","v4.18-rc6","v4.18-rc7","v4.18-rc8","v4.19","v4.19-rc1","v4.19-rc2","v4.19-rc3","v4.19-rc4","v4.19-rc5","v4.19-rc6","v4.19-rc7","v4.19-rc8","v4.2","v4.2-rc1","v4.2-rc2","v4.2-rc3","v4.2-rc4","v4.2-rc5","v4.2-rc6","v4.2-rc7","v4.2-rc8","v4.20","v4.20-rc1","v4.20-rc2","v4.20-rc3","v4.20-rc4","v4.20-rc5","v4.20-rc6","v4.20-rc7","v4.3","v4.3-rc1","v4.3-rc2","v4.3-rc3","v4.3-rc4","v4.3-rc5","v4.3-rc6","v4.3-rc7","v4.4","v4.4-rc1","v4.4-rc2","v4.4-rc3","v4.4-rc4","v4.4-rc5","v4.4-rc6","v4.4-rc7","v4.4-rc8","v4.5","v4.5-rc1","v4.5-rc2","v4.5-rc3","v4.5-rc4","v4.5-rc5","v4.5-rc6","v4.5-rc7","v4.6","v4.6-rc1","v4.6-rc2","v4.6-rc3","v4.6-rc4","v4.6-rc5","v4.6-rc6","v4.6-rc7","v4.7","v4.7-rc1","v4.7-rc2","v4.7-rc3","v4.7-rc4","v4.7-rc5","v4.7-rc6","v4.7-rc7","v4.8","v4.8-rc1","v4.8-rc2","v4.8-rc3","v4.8-rc4","v4.8-rc5","v4.8-rc6","v4.8-rc7","v4.8-rc8","v4.9","v4.9-rc1","v4.9-rc2","v4.9-rc3","v4.9-rc4","v4.9-rc5","v4.9-rc6","v4.9-rc7","v4.9-rc8","v5.0","v5.0-rc1","v5.0-rc2","v5.0-rc3","v5.0-rc4","v5.0-rc5","v5.0-rc6","v5.0-rc7","v5.0-rc8","v5.1","v5.1-rc1","v5.1-rc2","v5.1-rc3","v5.1-rc4","v5.1-rc5","v5.1-rc6","v5.1-rc7","v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.2","v5.2-rc1","v5.2-rc2","v5.2-rc3","v5.2-rc4","v5.2-rc5","v5.2-rc6","v5.2-rc7","v5.3","v5.3-rc1","v5.3-rc2","v5.3-rc3","v5.3-rc4","v5.3-rc5","v5.3-rc6","v5.3-rc7","v5.3-rc8","v5.4","v5.4-rc1","v5.4-rc2","v5.4-rc3","v5.4-rc4","v5.4-rc5","v5.4-rc6","v5.4-rc7","v5.4-rc8","v5.5","v5.5-rc1","v5.5-rc2","v5.5-rc3","v5.5-rc4","v5.5-rc5","v5.5-rc6","v5.5-rc7","v5.6","v5.6-rc1","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.

support mapping cb with vmalloc-backed coherent memory","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naccel/habanalabs: support mapping cb with vmalloc-backed coherent memory\n\nWhen IOMMU is enabled, dma_alloc_coherent() with GFP_USER may return\naddresses from the vmalloc range. If such an address is mapped without\nVM_MIXEDMAP, vm_insert_page() will trigger a BUG_ON due to the\nVM_PFNMAP restriction.\n\nFix this by checking for vmalloc addresses and setting VM_MIXEDMAP\nin the VMA before mapping.

infinite loop bug in the exFAT file system that can lead to a\nDenial-of-Service (DoS) condition. When a dentry in an exFAT filesystem is\nmalformed, the following system calls — SYS_openat, SYS_ftruncate, and\nSYS_pwrite64 — can cause the kernel to hang.\n\nRoot cause analysis shows that the size validation code in exfat_find()\ndoes not check whether dentry.stream.valid_size is negative. As a result,\nthe system calls mentioned above can succeed and eventually trigger the DoS\nissue.\n\nThis patch adds a check for negative dentry.stream.valid_size to prevent\nthis vulnerability.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"1acf1a564b6034b5af1e7fb23cb98cb3bb4f6003"},{"fixed":"6c627bcc1896ba62ec793d0c00da74f3c93ce3ad"},{"fixed":"204b1b02ee018ba52ad2ece21fe3a8643d66a1b2"},{"fixed":"82ebecdc74ff555daf70b811d854b1f32a296bea"}]}],"versions":["v5.10","v5.10-rc1","v5.10-rc2","v5.10-rc3","v5.10-rc4","v5.10-rc5","v5.10-rc6","v5.10-rc7","v5.11","v5.11-rc1","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.6","v5.6-rc2","v5.6-rc3","v5.6-rc4","v5.6-rc5","v5.6-rc6","v5.6-rc7","v5.7","v5.7-rc1","v5.7-rc2","v5.7-rc3","v5.7-rc4","v5.7-rc5","v5.7-rc6","v5.7-rc7","v5.8","v5.8-rc1","v5.8-rc2","v5.8-rc3","v5.8-rc4","v5.8-rc5","v5.8-rc6","v5.8-rc7","v5.9","v5.9-rc1","v5.9-rc2","v5.9-rc3","v5.9-rc4","v5.9-rc5","v5.9-rc6","v5.9-rc7","v5.9-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.10","v6.10-rc1","v6.10-rc2","v6.10-rc3","v6.10-rc4","v6.10-rc5","v6.10-rc6","v6.10-rc7","v6.11","v6.11-rc1","v6.11-rc2","v6.11-rc3","v6.11-rc4","v6.11-rc5","v6.11-rc6","v6.11-rc7","v6.12","v6.12-rc1","v6.12-rc2","v6.12-rc3","v6.12-rc4","v6.12-rc5","v6.12-rc6","v6.12-rc7","v6.12.1","v6.12.10","v6.12.11","v6.12.12","v6.12.13","v6.12.14","v6.12.15","v6.12.16","v6.12.17","v6.12.18","v6.12.19","v6.12.2","v6.12.20","v6.12.21","v6.12.22","v6.12.23","v6.12.24","v6.12.25","v6.12.26","v6.12.27","v6.12.28","v6.12.29","v6.12.3","v6.12.30","v6.12.31","v6.12.32","v6.12.33","v6.12.34","v6.12.35","v6.12.36","v6.12.37","v6.12.38","v6.12.39","v6.12.4","v6.12.40","v6.12.41","v6.12.42","v6.12.43","v6.12.44","v6.12.45","v6.12.46","v6.12.47","v6.12.48","v6.12.49","v6.12.5","v6.12.50","v6.12.51","v6.12.52","v6.12.53","v6.12.54","v6.12.55","v6.12.56","v6.12.57","v6.12.58","v6.12.6","v6.12.7","v6.12.8","v6.12.9","v6.13","v6.13-rc1","v6.13-rc2","v6.13-rc3","v6.13-rc4","v6.13-rc5","v6.13-rc6","v6.13-rc7","v6.14","v6.14-rc1","v6.14-rc2","v6.14-rc3","v6.14-rc4","v6.14-rc5","v6.14-rc6","v6.14-rc7","v6.15","v6.15-rc1","v6.15-rc2","v6.15-rc3","v6.15-rc4","v6.15-rc5","v6.15-rc6","v6.15-rc7","v6.16","v6.16-rc1","v6.16-rc2","v6.16-rc3","v6.16-rc4","v6.16-rc5","v6.16-rc6","v6.16-rc7","v6.17","v6.17-rc1","v6.17-rc2","v6.17-rc3","v6.17-rc4","v6.17-rc5","v6.17-rc6","v6.17-rc7","v6.17.1","v6.17.2","v6.17.3","v6.17.4","v6.17.5","v6.17.6","v6.17.7","v6.17.8","v6.18-rc1","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.4","v6.4-rc1","v6.4-rc2","v6.4-rc3","v6.4-rc4","v6.4-rc5","v6.4-rc6","v6.4-rc7","v6.5","v6.5-rc1","v6.5-rc2","v6.5-rc3","v6.5-rc4","v6.5-rc5","v6.5-rc6","v6.5-rc7","v6.6","v6.6-rc1","v6.6-rc2","v6.6-rc3","v6.6-rc4","v6.6-rc5","v6.6-rc6","v6.6-rc7","v6.7","v6.7-rc1","v6.7-rc2","v6.7-rc3","v6.7-rc4","v6.7-rc5","v6.7-rc6","v6.7-rc7","v6.7-rc8","v6.8","v6.8-rc1","v6.8-rc2","v6.8-rc3","v6.8-rc4","v6.8-rc5","v6.8-rc6","v6.8-rc7","v6.9","v6.9-rc1","v6.9-rc2","v6.9-rc3","v6.9-rc4","v6.9-rc5","v6.9-rc6","v6.9-rc7"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40287.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.7.0"},{"fixed":"6.12.59"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.17.9"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2025-40287.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/204b1b02ee018ba52ad2ece21fe3a8643d66a1b2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6c627bcc1896ba62ec793d0c00da74f3c93ce3ad"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/82ebecdc74ff555daf70b811d854b1f32a296bea"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2025/40xxx/CVE-2025-40287.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"h

0 || ...).\n\n\tcount = min(end_offset - dn.ofs_in_node, pg_end - pg_start);\n\nThis patch introduces a new node_type NODE_TYPE_NON_INODE, then allowing\npassing the new_type to sanity_check_node_footer in f2fs_get_node_folio()\nto detect corruption that a non-inode dnode has the same footer.ino and\nfooter.nid.\n\nScripts to reproduce:\nmkfs.f2fs -f /dev/vdb\nmount /dev/vdb

ipc: fix use-after-free in ipc_msg_send_request","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: ipc: fix use-after-free in ipc_msg_send_request\n\nipc_msg_send_request() waits for a generic netlink reply using an\nipc_msg_table_entry on the stack. The generic netlink handler\n(handle_generic_event()/handle_response()) fills entry->response under\nipc_msg_table_lock, but ipc_msg_send_request() used to validate and free\nentry->response without holding the same lock.\n\nUnder high concurrency this allows a race where handle_response() is\ncopying data into entry->response while ipc_msg_send_request() has just\nfreed it, leading to a slab-use-after-free reported by KASAN in\nhandle_generic_event():\n\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in handle_generic_event+0x3c4/0x5f0 [ksmbd]\n  Write of size 12 at addr ffff888198ee6e20 by task

ipc_msg_send_request() while validating\n  entry->response, freeing it when invalid, and removing the entry from\n  ipc_msg_table.\n- Returning the final entry->response pointer to the caller only

avoid scheduling association deletion twice","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet-fc: avoid scheduling association deletion twice\n\nWhen forcefully shutting down a port via the configfs interface,\nnvmet_port_subsys_drop_link() first calls nvmet_port_del_ctrls() and\nthen nvmet_disable_port(). Both functions will eventually schedule all\nremaining associations for deletion.\n\nThe current implementation checks whether an association is about to be\nremoved, but only after the work item has already been scheduled. As a\nresult, it is possible for the first scheduled work item to free all\nresources, and then for the same work item to be scheduled again for\ndeletion.\n\nBecause the association list is an RCU list, it is not possible to take\na lock and remove the list entry directly, so it cannot be looked up\nagain. Instead, a flag (terminating) must be used to determine whether\nthe association is already in the process of being

sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop\n\nIn cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen\nand backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes\nthat the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this\nassumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent\nqdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog\naccounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference\n(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).\n\nThis patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by\nobserving the difference before and

imm: Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: imm: Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work\n\nThe delayed work item 'imm_tq' is initialized in imm_attach() and\nscheduled via imm_queuecommand() for processing SCSI commands.  When the\nIMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),\nthe imm_struct device instance is deallocated.\n\nHowever, the delayed work might still be pending or executing\nwhen imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs\nwhen the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already\nfreed imm_struct memory.\n\nThe race condition can occur as follows:\n\nCPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1\n                       | imm_queuecommand()\n                       |   imm_queuecommand_lck()\nimm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()\n  kfree(dev) //FREE

imon: make send_packet() more robust","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: imon: make send_packet() more robust\n\nsyzbot is reporting that imon has three problems which result in\nhung tasks due to forever holding device lock [1].\n\nFirst problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\nafter ictx->dev_present_intf0 became true, usb_rx_callback_intf0()\nresubmits urb after printk(), and resubmitted urb causes\nusb_rx_callback_intf0() to again get -EPROTO error. This results in\nprintk() flooding (RCU stalls).\n\nAlan Stern commented [2] that\n\n  In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust\n  error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the\n  number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed, perhaps with a\n  time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to\n  do this; they simply give up right away.  This makes them more\n  vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers, but in\n  reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong\n  with giving up right away.\n\nbut imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever;\nthis behavior should be fixed.\n\nSince I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any\nerror code, this patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from\nmodules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.\nir_toy, mceusb and igorplugusb).\n\nSecond problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\nbefore ictx->dev_present_intf0 becomes true, usb_rx_callback_intf0() always\nresubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf (\"[media] imon: don't wedge\nhardware after early callbacks\"). Move the ictx->dev_present_intf0 test\nintroduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a (\"[media] imon: don't parse scancodes\nuntil intf configured\") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet(), or\nthe first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.\nhung task).\n\nThird problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some\nreason (e.g. flaky hardware; the reproducer for this problem sometimes\nprevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called),\nwait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.\nhung task). As a workaround for such situation, change send_packet() to\nwait for completion with timeout of 10

route: Prevent rt_bind_exception() from rebinding stale fnhe","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv4: route: Prevent rt_bind_exception() from rebinding stale fnhe\n\nThe sit driver's packet transmission path calls: sit_tunnel_xmit() ->\nupdate_or_create_fnhe(), which lead to fnhe_remove_oldest() being called\nto delete entries exceeding FNHE_RECLAIM_DEPTH+random.\n\nThe race window is between fnhe_remove_oldest() selecting fnheX for\ndeletion and the subsequent kfree_rcu(). During this time, the\nconcurrent path's __mkroute_output() -> find_exception() can fetch the\nsoon-to-be-deleted fnheX, and rt_bind_exception() then binds it with a\nnew dst using a dst_hold(). When the original fnheX is freed via RCU,\nthe dst reference remains permanently leaked.\n\nCPU 0                             CPU 1\n__mkroute_output()\n  find_exception() [fnheX]\n                                  update_or_create_fnhe()\n                                    fnhe_remove_oldest() [fnheX]\n  rt_bind_exception() [bind dst]\n                                  RCU callback [fnheX freed, dst leak]\n\nThis issue manifests as a device reference count leak and a warning in\ndmesg when unregistering the net device:\n\n  unregister_netdevice: waiting for sitX to become free. Usage count = N\n\nIdo Schimmel provided the simple test validation method [1].\n\nThe fix clears 'oldest->fnhe_daddr' before calling fnhe_flush_routes().\nSince rt_bind_exception() checks this field, setting it to zero prevents\nthe stale fnhe from being reused and bound to a new dst just before it\nis freed.\n\n[1]\nip netns add ns1\nip -n ns1 link set dev lo up\nip -n ns1 address add

netpoll: fix incorrect refcount handling causing incorrect cleanup","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: netpoll: fix incorrect refcount handling causing incorrect cleanup\n\ncommit efa95b01da18 (\"netpoll: fix use after free\") incorrectly\nignored the refcount and prematurely set dev->npinfo to NULL during\nnetpoll cleanup, leading to improper behavior and memory leaks.\n\nScenario causing lack of proper cleanup:\n\n1) A netpoll is associated with a NIC (e.g., eth0) and netdev->npinfo is\n   allocated, and refcnt = 1\n   - Keep in mind that npinfo is shared among all netpoll instances. In\n     this case, there is just one.\n\n2) Another netpoll is also associated with the same NIC and\n   npinfo->refcnt += 1.\n   - Now dev->npinfo->refcnt = 2;\n   - There is just one npinfo associated to the netdev.\n\n3) When the first netpolls goes to clean up:\n   - The first cleanup succeeds and clears np->dev->npinfo, ignoring\n     refcnt.\n     - It basically calls `RCU_INIT_POINTER(np->dev->npinfo, NULL);`\n   - Set dev->npinfo = NULL, without proper cleanup\n   - No ->ndo_netpoll_cleanup() is either called\n\n4) Now the second target tries to clean up\n   - The second cleanup fails because np->dev->npinfo is already NULL.\n     * In this case, ops->ndo_netpoll_cleanup() was never called, and\n       the skb pool is not cleaned as well (for the second netpoll\n       instance)\n  - This leaks npinfo and skbpool skbs, which is clearly reported by\n    kmemleak.\n\nRevert commit efa95b01da18 (\"netpoll: fix use after free\") and adds\nclarifying comments emphasizing that npinfo cleanup should only happen\nonce the refcount reaches zero, ensuring stable and correct

Prevents free active kevent","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: Prevents free active kevent\n\nThe root cause of this issue are:\n1. When probing the usbnet device, executing usbnet_link_change(dev, 0, 0);\nput the kevent work in global workqueue. However, the kevent has not yet\nbeen scheduled when the usbnet device is unregistered. Therefore, executing\nfree_netdev() results in the \"free active object (kevent)\" error reported\nhere.\n\n2. Another factor is that when calling usbnet_disconnect()->unregister_netdev(),\nif the usbnet device is up, ndo_stop() is executed to cancel the kevent.\nHowever, because the device is not up, ndo_stop() is not executed.\n\nThe solution to this problem is to cancel the kevent before

check whether the SCSI\nhost tag set has already been initialized. tag_set->ops is set by\nscsi_mq_setup_tags() just before blk_mq_alloc_tag_set() is called.

calling cpufreq_cpu_get(0) without checking\nfor a NULL policy pointer. On some systems, this could lead to a\nNULL dereference and a kernel warning or panic.\n\nThis patch adds a check using unlikely() and returns early if the\npolicy is NULL.\n\nBugzilla:

->d_parent->d_inode dereferencing\n\nTheoretically it's an oopsable race, but I don't believe one can manage\nto hit it on real hardware; might become doable on a KVM, but it still\nwon't be easy to attack.\n\nAnyway, it's easy to deal with - since xdr_encode_hyper() is just a call of\nput_unaligned_be64(), we can put that under ->d_lock and be done with

Fix softlockup in ftrace_module_enable","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nftrace: Fix softlockup in ftrace_module_enable\n\nA soft lockup was observed when loading amdgpu module.\nIf a module has a lot of tracable functions, multiple calls\nto kallsyms_lookup can spend too much time in RCU critical\nsection and with disabled preemption, causing kernel panic.\nThis is the same issue that was fixed in\ncommit d0b24b4e91fc (\"ftrace: Prevent RCU stall on PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY\nkernels\") and commit 42ea22e754ba (\"ftrace: Add cond_resched() to\nftrace_graph_set_hash()\").\n\nFix it the same way by adding cond_resched() in

enetc: fix the deadlock of enetc_mdio_lock","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: enetc: fix the deadlock of enetc_mdio_lock\n\nAfter applying the workaround for err050089, the LS1028A platform\nexperiences RCU stalls on RT kernel. This issue is caused by the\nrecursive acquisition of the read lock enetc_mdio_lock. Here list some\nof the call stacks identified under the enetc_poll path that may lead to\na deadlock:\n\nenetc_poll\n  -> enetc_lock_mdio\n  -> enetc_clean_rx_ring OR napi_complete_done\n     -> napi_gro_receive\n        -> enetc_start_xmit\n           -> enetc_lock_mdio\n           -> enetc_map_tx_buffs\n           -> enetc_unlock_mdio\n  -> enetc_unlock_mdio\n\nAfter enetc_poll acquires the read lock, a higher-priority writer attempts\nto acquire the lock, causing preemption. The writer detects that a\nread lock is already held and is scheduled out. However, readers under\nenetc_poll cannot acquire the read lock again because a writer is already\nwaiting, leading to a thread hang.\n\nCurrently, the deadlock is avoided by adjusting enetc_lock_mdio to prevent\nrecursive lock

ESR IE parsing\n\nThe Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling in OnBeacon accessed\n*(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these\noffsets lie within the received frame buffer. A malformed beacon with\nan ESR IE positioned at the end of the buffer could cause an\nout-of-bounds read, potentially triggering a kernel panic.\n\nAdd a boundary check to ensure that the ESR IE body and the subsequent\nbytes are within the limits of the frame before attempting to access\nthem.\n\nThis prevents OOB reads caused by malformed beacon

restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinfmt_misc: restore write access before closing files opened by open_exec()\n\nbm_register_write() opens an executable file using open_exec(), which\ninternally calls do_open_execat() and denies write access on the file to\navoid modification while it is being executed.\n\nHowever, when an error occurs, bm_register_write() closes the file using\nfilp_close() directly. This does not restore the write permission, which\nmay cause subsequent write operations on the same file to fail.\n\nFix this by calling exe_file_allow_write_access() before filp_close() to\nrestore the write permission

An attacker can use a malicious USB descriptor\nto force the allocation of a very small buffer.\n\nSubsequently, if the device sends an interrupt packet with a specific\npattern (e.g., where the first byte is 0x80 or 0x42),\nthe pegasus_parse_packet() function parses the packet without checking\nthe allocated buffer size.

Fix proto fallback detection with BPF","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: Fix proto fallback detection with BPF\n\nThe sockmap feature allows bpf syscall from userspace, or based\non bpf sockops, replacing the sk_prot of sockets during protocol stack\nprocessing with sockmap's custom read/write interfaces.\n'''\ntcp_rcv_state_process()\n

helper\n          tcp_bpf_update_proto()  <== update sk_prot\n'''\n\nWhen the server has MPTCP enabled but the client sends a TCP SYN\nwithout MPTCP, subflow_syn_recv_sock() performs a fallback on the\nsubflow, replacing the subflow sk's sk_prot with the native sk_prot.\n'''\nsubflow_syn_recv_sock()\n  subflow_ulp_fallback()\n    subflow_drop_ctx()\n      mptcp_subflow_ops_undo_override()\n'''\n\nThen, this subflow can be normally used by sockmap, which replaces the\nnative sk_prot with sockmap's custom sk_prot. The issue occurs when the\nuser executes accept::mptcp_stream_accept::mptcp_fallback_tcp_ops().\nHere, it uses sk->sk_prot to compare with the native sk_prot, but this\nis incorrect when sockmap is used, as we may incorrectly set\nsk->sk_socket->ops.\n\nThis fix uses the more generic sk_family for the comparison instead.\n\nAdditionally, this also prevents a WARNING from occurring:\n\nresult

Fix incorrect error check in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narch_topology: Fix incorrect error check in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()\n\nFix incorrect use of PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() in topology_parse_cpu_capacity()\nwhich causes the code to proceed with NULL clock pointers. The current\nlogic uses !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) which evaluates to true for both\nvalid pointers and NULL, leading to potential NULL pointer dereference\nin clk_get_rate().\n\nPer include/linux/err.h documentation, PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(ptr) returns:\n\"The error code within @ptr if it is an error pointer; 0 otherwise.\"\n\nThis means PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO() returns 0 for both valid pointers AND NULL\npointers. Therefore !PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(cpu_clk) evaluates to true (proceed)\nwhen cpu_clk is either valid or NULL, causing clk_get_rate(NULL) to be\ncalled when of_clk_get() returns NULL.\n\nReplace with !IS_ERR_OR_NULL(cpu_clk) which only proceeds for valid\npointers, preventing potential NULL pointer dereference in

fix gpu page fault after hibernation on PF passthrough","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: fix gpu page fault after hibernation on PF passthrough\n\nOn PF passthrough environment, after hibernate and then resume, coralgemm\nwill cause gpu page fault.\n\nMode1 reset happens during hibernate, but partition mode is not restored\non resume, register mmCP_HYP_XCP_CTL and mmCP_PSP_XCP_CTL is not right\nafter resume. When CP access the MQD BO, wrong stride size is used,\nthis will cause out of bound access on the MQD BO, resulting page fault.\n\nThe fix is to ensure gfx_v9_4_3_switch_compute_partition() is called\nwhen resume from a hibernation.\nKFD resume is called separately during a reset recovery or resume from\nsuspend sequence. Hence it's not required to be called as part of\npartition switch.\n\n(cherry picked from commit
