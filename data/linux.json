storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts\n\nHyper-V provides the ability to connect Fibre Channel LUNs to the host\nsystem and present them in a guest VM as a SCSI device. I/O to the vFC\ndevice is handled by the storvsc driver. The storvsc driver includes a\npartial integration with the FC transport implemented in the generic\nportion of the Linux SCSI subsystem so that FC attributes can be displayed\nin /sys.  However, the partial integration means that some aspects of vFC\ndon't work properly. Unfortunately, a full and correct integration isn't\npractical because of limitations in what Hyper-V provides to the guest.\n\nIn particular, in the context of Hyper-V storvsc, the FC transport timeout\nfunction fc_eh_timed_out() causes a kernel panic because it can't find the\nrport and dereferences a NULL pointer. The original patch that added the\ncall from storvsc_eh_timed_out() to fc_eh_timed_out() is faulty in this\nregard.\n\nIn many cases a timeout is due to a transient condition, so the situation\ncan be improved by just continuing to wait like with other I/O requests\nissued by storvsc, and avoiding the guaranteed panic. For a permanent\nfailure, continuing to wait may result in a hung thread instead of a panic,\nwhich again may be better.\n\nSo fix the panic by removing the storvsc call to fc_eh_timed_out().  This\nallows storvsc to keep waiting for a response.  The change has been tested\nby users who experienced a panic in fc_eh_timed_out() due to transient\ntimeouts, and it solves their problem.\n\nIn the future we may want to deprecate the vFC functionality in storvsc\nsince it can't be fully fixed. But it has current users for whom it is\nworking well enough, so it should probably stay for a while

Fix function prototype mismatch for ext4_feat_ktype","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: Fix function prototype mismatch for ext4_feat_ktype\n\nWith clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),\nindirect call targets are validated against the expected function\npointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate\nROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,\nwhich manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.\n\next4_feat_ktype was setting the \"release\" handler to \"kfree\", which\ndoesn't have a matching function prototype. Add a simple wrapper\nwith the correct prototype.\n\nThis was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict\nflag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,\nwhich

header to stack buffer, not just basic one\n\nEric Dumazet says:\n  nf_conntrack_dccp_packet() has an unique:\n\n  dh = skb_header_pointer(skb, dataoff, sizeof(_dh), &_dh);\n\n  And nothing more is 'pulled' from the packet, depending on the content.\n  dh->dccph_doff, and/or dh->dccph_x ...)\n  So dccp_ack_seq() is happily reading stuff past the _dh buffer.\n\nBUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in nf_conntrack_dccp_packet+0x1134/0x11c0\nRead of size 4 at addr ffff000128f66e0c by task syz-executor.2/29371\n[..]\n\nFix this by increasing the stack buffer to also include room for\nthe extra sequence numbers and all the known dccp packet type headers,\nthen pull again after the initial validation of the basic header.\n\nWhile at it, mark packets invalid that lack 48bit sequence bit

is just going to be migrated to its current running CPU.\nThis is because that on load balance if the dst_cpu is not allowed by the\ntask, we'll re-select a new_dst_cpu as a candidate. If no task can be\nbalanced to dst_cpu we'll try to balance the task to the new_dst_cpu\ninstead. In this case when the migration disabled task is not on CPU it\nonly allows to run on its current CPU, load balance will select its\ncurrent CPU as new_dst_cpu and later triggers the warning above.\n\nThe new_dst_cpu is chosen from the env->dst_grpmask. Currently it\ncontains CPUs in sched_group_span() and if we have overlapped groups it's\npossible to run into this case. This patch makes env->dst_grpmask of\ngroup_balance_mask() which exclude any CPUs from the busiest group and\nsolve the issue.

check send stream number after wait_for_sndbuf","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: check send stream number after wait_for_sndbuf\n\nThis patch fixes a corner case where the asoc out stream count may change\nafter wait_for_sndbuf.\n\nWhen the main thread in the client starts a connection, if its out stream\ncount is set to N while the in stream count in the server is set to N - 2,\nanother thread in the client keeps sending the msgs with stream number\nN - 1, and waits for sndbuf before processing INIT_ACK.\n\nHowever, after processing INIT_ACK, the out stream count in the client is\nshrunk to N - 2, the same to the in stream count in the server. The crash\noccurs when the thread waiting for sndbuf is awake and sends the msg in a\nnon-existing stream(N - 1), the call trace is as below:\n\n  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range

indicates that\nINNO_PHY_PORT_NUM is allowed value for 'i' in the same loop.\n\nThis > comparison needs to be changed to >=, otherwise it potentially leads\nto an out of bounds write on the next

fec: Better handle pm_runtime_get() failing in .remove()","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fec: Better handle pm_runtime_get() failing in .remove()\n\nIn the (unlikely) event that pm_runtime_get() (disguised as\npm_runtime_resume_and_get()) fails, the remove callback returned an\nerror early. The problem with this is that the driver core ignores the\nerror value and continues removing the device. This results in a\nresource leak. Worse the devm allocated resources are freed and so if a\ncallback of the driver is called later the register mapping is already\ngone which probably results in a

Fix null-ptr-deref of ip6_null_entry->rt6i_idev in icmp6_dev().","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nicmp6: Fix null-ptr-deref of ip6_null_entry->rt6i_idev in icmp6_dev().\n\nWith some IPv6 Ext Hdr (RPL, SRv6, etc.), we can send a packet that\nhas the link-local address as src and dst IP and will be forwarded to\nan external IP in the IPv6 Ext Hdr.\n\nFor example, the script below generates a packet whose src IP is the\nlink-local address and dst is updated to 11::.\n\n  # for f in $(find /proc/sys/net/ -name *seg6_enabled*); do echo 1 > $f; done\n  # python3\n  >>> from socket import *\n  >>> from scapy.all import *\n  >>>\n  >>> SRC_ADDR = DST_ADDR = \"fe80::5054:ff:fe12:3456\"\n  >>>\n  >>> pkt = IPv6(src=SRC_ADDR, dst=DST_ADDR)\n  >>> pkt /= IPv6ExtHdrSegmentRouting(type=4, addresses=[\"11::\", \"22::\"], segleft=1)\n  >>>\n  >>> sk = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)\n  >>> sk.sendto(bytes(pkt), (DST_ADDR, 0))\n\nFor such a packet, we call ip6_route_input() to look up a route for the\nnext destination in these three functions depending on the header type.\n\n  * ipv6_rthdr_rcv()\n  * ipv6_rpl_srh_rcv()\n  * ipv6_srh_rcv()\n\nIf no route is found, ip6_null_entry is set to skb, and the following\ndst_input(skb) calls ip6_pkt_drop().\n\nFinally, in icmp6_dev(), we dereference skb_rt6_info(skb)->rt6i_idev->dev\nas the input device is the loopback interface.  Then, we have to check if\nskb_rt6_info(skb)->rt6i_idev is NULL or not to avoid NULL pointer deref\nfor ip6_null_entry.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n PF:

target: iscsi: Fix a race condition between login_work and the login thread","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: iscsi: Fix a race condition between login_work and the login thread\n\nIn case a malicious initiator sends some random data immediately after a\nlogin PDU; the iscsi_target_sk_data_ready() callback will schedule the\nlogin_work and, at the same time, the negotiation may end without clearing\nthe LOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag (because no additional PDU exchanges are\nrequired to complete the login).\n\nThe login has been completed but the login_work function will find the\nLOGIN_FLAGS_INITIAL_PDU flag set and will never stop from rescheduling\nitself; at this point, if the initiator drops the connection, the\niscsit_conn structure will be freed, login_work will dereference a released\nsocket structure and the kernel crashes.\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000230\nPF: supervisor write access in kernel mode\nPF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page\nWorkqueue: events iscsi_target_do_login_rx [iscsi_target_mod]\nRIP: 0010:_raw_read_lock_bh+0x15/0x30\nCall trace:\n

Fix detection of atomic context","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: Fix detection of atomic context\n\nCurrent check for atomic context is not sufficient as\nz_erofs_decompressqueue_endio can be called under rcu lock\nfrom blk_mq_flush_plug_list(). See the stacktrace [1]\n\nIn such case we should hand off the decompression work for async\nprocessing rather than trying to do sync decompression in current\ncontext. Patch fixes the detection by checking for\nrcu_read_lock_any_held() and while at it use more appropriate\n!in_task() check than in_atomic().\n\nBackground: Historically erofs would always schedule a kworker for\ndecompression which would incur the scheduling cost regardless of\nthe context. But z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio() may not always\nbe in atomic context and we could actually benefit from doing the\ndecompression in z_erofs_decompressqueue_endio() if we are in\nthread context, for example when running with dm-verity.\nThis optimization was later added in patch [2] which has shown\nimprovement in performance benchmarks.\n\n==============================================\n[1]

designware: Fix handling of real but unexpected device interrupts","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: designware: Fix handling of real but unexpected device interrupts\n\nCommit c7b79a752871 (\"mfd: intel-lpss: Add Intel Alder Lake PCH-S PCI\nIDs\") caused a regression on certain Gigabyte motherboards for Intel\nAlder Lake-S where system crashes to NULL pointer dereference in\ni2c_dw_xfer_msg() when system resumes from S3 sleep state (\"deep\").\n\nI was able to debug the issue on Gigabyte Z690 AORUS ELITE and made\nfollowing notes:\n\n- Issue happens when resuming from S3 but not when resuming from\n  \"s2idle\"\n- PCI device 00:15.0 == i2c_designware.0 is already in D0 state when\n  system enters into pci_pm_resume_noirq() while all other i2c_designware\n  PCI devices are in D3. Devices were runtime suspended and in D3 prior\n  entering into suspend\n- Interrupt comes after pci_pm_resume_noirq() when device interrupts are\n  re-enabled\n- According to register dump the interrupt really comes from the\n  i2c_designware.0. Controller is enabled, I2C target address register\n  points to a one detectable I2C device address 0x60 and the\n  DW_IC_RAW_INTR_STAT register START_DET, STOP_DET, ACTIVITY and\n  TX_EMPTY bits are set indicating completed I2C transaction.\n\nMy guess is that the firmware uses this controller to communicate with\nan on-board I2C device during resume but does not disable the controller\nbefore giving control to an operating system.\n\nI was told the UEFI update fixes this but never the less it revealed the\ndriver is not ready to handle TX_EMPTY (or RX_FULL) interrupt when device\nis supposed to be idle and state variables are not set (especially the\ndev->msgs pointer which may point to NULL or stale old data).\n\nIntroduce a new software status flag STATUS_ACTIVE indicating when the\ncontroller is active in driver point of view. Now treat all interrupts\nthat occur when is not set as unexpected and mask all interrupts from\nthe controller.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"c7b79a75287141cef5bbaeaf1c942269c08cd52e"},{"fixed":"7fa5304c4b5b425d4a0b3acf10139a7f6108a85f"},{"fixed":"a206f7fbe9589c60fafad12884628c909ecb042f"},{"fixed":"aa59ac81e859006d3a1df035a19b3f2089110f93"},{"fixed":"301c8f5c32c8fb79c67539bc23972dc3ef48024c"}]}],"versions":["v5.11","v5.11-rc2","v5.11-rc3","v5.11-rc4","v5.11-rc5","v5.11-rc6","v5.11-rc7","v5.12","v5.12-rc1","v5.12-rc1-dontuse","v5.12-rc2","v5.12-rc3","v5.12-rc4","v5.12-rc5","v5.12-rc6","v5.12-rc7","v5.12-rc8","v5.13","v5.13-rc1","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.11","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.8","v5.15.9","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v5.19.1","v5.19.10","v5.19.11","v5.19.12","v5.19.13","v5.19.14","v5.19.15","v5.19.16","v5.19.2","v5.19.3","v5.19.4","v5.19.5","v5.19.6","v5.19.7","v5.19.8","v5.19.9","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.0.1","v6.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50370.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.12.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.75"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"5.19.17"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.20.0"},{"fixed":"6.0.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2022-50370.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/301c8f5c32c8fb79c67539bc23972dc3ef48024c"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7fa5304c4b5b425d4a0b3acf10139a7f6108a85f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a206f7fbe9589c60fafad12884628c909ecb042f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aa59ac81e859006d3a1df035a19b3f2089110f93"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50370.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50370"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2022/50xxx/CVE-2022-50370.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-15T01:09:53.394623Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53316","published":"2025-09-16T16:11:53.059Z","modified":"2026-01-14T23:22:02.748113Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2025:03615-1","SUSE-SU-2025:03628-1","SUSE-SU-2025:3716-1","SUSE-SU-2025:3751-1","SUSE-SU-2025:3761-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4057-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4132-1"],"summary":"drm/msm/dp: Free resources after unregistering them","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/msm/dp: Free resources after unregistering them\n\nThe DP component's unbind operation walks through the submodules to\nunregister and clean things up.

Each thread rewrite channels's descriptor as soon as\ndevice_issue_pending is called. It leads to the situation that\nthe driver thinks that it uses the right descriptor in interrupt\nhandler while channels's descriptor has been changed by other\nthread. The descriptor which in fact reported interrupt will not\nbe handled any more, as well as its tx->callback.\nThat's why timeout reports.\n\nWith current fixes channels' descriptor changes it's value only\nwhen it has been used. A new descriptor is acquired from\nvc->desc_issued queue that is already filled with descriptors\nthat are ready to be sent. Threads have no direct access to DMA\nchannel descriptor. In case of channel's descriptor is busy, try\nto submit to HW again when a descriptor is completed.

terminator size in EA length\n\nThe smb2_set_ea function, which handles Extended Attributes (EA),\nwas performing buffer validation checks that incorrectly omitted the size\nof the null terminating character (+1 byte) for EA Name.\nThis patch fixes the issue by explicitly adding '+ 1' to EaNameLength where\nthe null terminator is expected to be present in the buffer, ensuring\nthe validation accurately reflects the total required buffer

Handle pairing of E-switch via uplink un/load APIs","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: Handle pairing of E-switch via uplink un/load APIs\n\nIn case user switch a device from switchdev mode to legacy mode, mlx5\nfirst unpair the E-switch and afterwards unload the uplink vport.\nFrom the other hand, in case user remove or reload a device, mlx5\nfirst unload the uplink vport and afterwards unpair the E-switch.\n\nThe latter is causing a bug[1], hence, handle pairing of E-switch as\npart of uplink un/load APIs.\n\n[1]\nIn case VF_LAG is used, every tc fdb flow is duplicated to the peer\nesw. However, the original esw keeps a pointer to this duplicated\nflow, not the peer esw.\ne.g.: if user create tc fdb flow over esw0, the flow is duplicated\nover esw1, in FW/HW, but in SW, esw0 keeps a pointer to the duplicated\nflow.\nDuring module unload while a peer tc fdb flow is still offloaded, in\ncase the first device to be removed is the peer device (esw1 in the\nexample above), the peer net-dev is destroyed, and so the mlx5e_priv\nis memset to 0.\nAfterwards, the peer device is trying to unpair himself from the\noriginal device (esw0 in the example above). Unpair API invoke the\noriginal device to clear peer flow from its eswitch (esw0), but the\npeer flow, which is stored over the original eswitch (esw0), is\ntrying to use the peer mlx5e_priv, which is memset to 0 and result in\nbellow kernel-oops.\n\n[  157.964081 ] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 000000000002ce60\n[  157.964662 ] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[

we'll get a page, set it\nas mapped, and if it's not Uptodate we'll read it.  However between the\nread and re-locking the page we could have called release_folio() on the\npage, but left the page in the file mapping.  release_folio() can clear\nthe page private, and thus further down we blow up when we go to modify\nthe subpage bits.\n\nFix this by putting the set_page_extent_mapped() after the read.  This\nis safe because read_folio() will call set_page_extent_mapped() before\nit does the read, and then if we clear page private but leave it on the\nmapping we're completely safe re-setting set_page_extent_mapped().

set dummy blocksize to read boot_block when mounting","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nntfs: set dummy blocksize to read boot_block when mounting\n\nWhen mounting, sb->s_blocksize is used to read the boot_block without\nbeing defined or validated. Set a dummy blocksize before attempting to\nread the boot_block.\n\nThe issue can be triggered with the following syz reproducer:\n\n  mkdirat(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000080)='./file1\\x00', 0x0)\n  r4 = openat$nullb(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000040), 0x121403, 0x0)\n  ioctl$FS_IOC_SETFLAGS(r4, 0x40081271, &(0x7f0000000980)=0x4000)\n  mount(&(0x7f0000000140)=@nullb, &(0x7f0000000040)='./cgroup\\x00',\n        &(0x7f0000000000)='ntfs3\\x00', 0x2208004, 0x0)\n  syz_clone(0x88200200, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n\nHere, the ioctl sets the bdev block size to 16384. During mount,\nget_tree_bdev_flags() calls sb_set_blocksize(sb, block_size(bdev)),\nbut since block_size(bdev) > PAGE_SIZE, sb_set_blocksize() leaves\nsb->s_blocksize at zero.\n\nLater,

arm_ffa: Fix FFA device names for logical partitions","details":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirmware: arm_ffa: Fix FFA device names for logical partitions\n\nEach physical partition can provide multiple services each with UUID.\nEach such service can be presented as logical partition with a unique\ncombination of VM ID and UUID. The number of distinct UUID in a system\nwill be less than or equal to the number of logical partitions.\n\nHowever, currently it fails to register more than one logical partition\nor service within a physical partition as the device name contains only\nVM ID while both VM ID and UUID are maintained in the partition information.\nThe kernel complains with the below message:\n\n  | sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/arm-ffa-8001'\n  | CPU: 1 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 6.3.0-rc7 #8\n  | Hardware name: FVP Base RevC (DT)\n  | Call trace:\n  |  dump_backtrace+0xf8/0x118\n  |  show_stack+0x18/0x24\n  |  dump_stack_lvl+0x50/0x68\n  |  dump_stack+0x18/0x24\n  |  sysfs_create_dir_ns+0xe0/0x13c\n  |  kobject_add_internal+0x220/0x3d4\n  |  kobject_add+0x94/0x100\n  |  device_add+0x144/0x5d8\n  |  device_register+0x20/0x30\n  |  ffa_device_register+0x88/0xd8\n  |  ffa_setup_partitions+0x108/0x1b8\n  |  ffa_init+0x2ec/0x3a4\n  |  do_one_initcall+0xcc/0x240\n  |  do_initcall_level+0x8c/0xac\n  |  do_initcalls+0x54/0x94\n  |  do_basic_setup+0x1c/0x28\n  |  kernel_init_freeable+0x100/0x16c\n  |  kernel_init+0x20/0x1a0\n  |  ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\n  | kobject_add_internal failed for arm-ffa-8001 with -EEXIST, don't try to\n  | register things with the same name in the same directory.\n  | arm_ffa arm-ffa: unable to register device arm-ffa-8001 err=-17\n  | ARM FF-A: ffa_setup_partitions: failed to register partition ID 0x8001\n\nBy virtue of being random enough to avoid collisions when generated in a\ndistributed system, there is no way to compress UUID keys to the number\nof bits required to identify each. We can eliminate '-' in the name but\nit is not worth eliminating 4 bytes and add unnecessary logic for doing\nthat. Also v1.0 doesn't provide the UUID of the partitions which makes\nit hard to use the same for the device name.\n\nSo to keep it simple, let us alloc an ID using ida_alloc() and append the\nsame to \"arm-ffa\" to make up a unique device name. Also stash the id value\nin ffa_dev to help freeing the ID later when the device is destroyed.","affected":[{"ranges":[{"type":"GIT","repo":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git","events":[{"introduced":"e781858488b918e30a6ff28e9eab6058b787e3b3"},{"fixed":"c2f65991097a62efbdb2bed3c06fc86b08c9593b"},{"fixed":"dfc5aaa57f52a5800c339369d235fa30fb734feb"},{"fixed":"93d0cbe88118fcef234d3ebcbdadcb9ebe9d34f1"},{"fixed":"19b8766459c41c6f318f8a548cc1c66dffd18363"}]}],"versions":["v5.13","v5.13-rc2","v5.13-rc3","v5.13-rc4","v5.13-rc5","v5.13-rc6","v5.13-rc7","v5.14","v5.14-rc1","v5.14-rc2","v5.14-rc3","v5.14-rc4","v5.14-rc5","v5.14-rc6","v5.14-rc7","v5.15","v5.15-rc1","v5.15-rc2","v5.15-rc3","v5.15-rc4","v5.15-rc5","v5.15-rc6","v5.15-rc7","v5.15.1","v5.15.10","v5.15.100","v5.15.101","v5.15.102","v5.15.103","v5.15.104","v5.15.105","v5.15.106","v5.15.107","v5.15.108","v5.15.109","v5.15.11","v5.15.110","v5.15.111","v5.15.112","v5.15.113","v5.15.12","v5.15.13","v5.15.14","v5.15.15","v5.15.16","v5.15.17","v5.15.18","v5.15.19","v5.15.2","v5.15.20","v5.15.21","v5.15.22","v5.15.23","v5.15.24","v5.15.25","v5.15.26","v5.15.27","v5.15.28","v5.15.29","v5.15.3","v5.15.30","v5.15.31","v5.15.32","v5.15.33","v5.15.34","v5.15.35","v5.15.36","v5.15.37","v5.15.38","v5.15.39","v5.15.4","v5.15.40","v5.15.41","v5.15.42","v5.15.43","v5.15.44","v5.15.45","v5.15.46","v5.15.47","v5.15.48","v5.15.49","v5.15.5","v5.15.50","v5.15.51","v5.15.52","v5.15.53","v5.15.54","v5.15.55","v5.15.56","v5.15.57","v5.15.58","v5.15.59","v5.15.6","v5.15.60","v5.15.61","v5.15.62","v5.15.63","v5.15.64","v5.15.65","v5.15.66","v5.15.67","v5.15.68","v5.15.69","v5.15.7","v5.15.70","v5.15.71","v5.15.72","v5.15.73","v5.15.74","v5.15.75","v5.15.76","v5.15.77","v5.15.78","v5.15.79","v5.15.8","v5.15.80","v5.15.81","v5.15.82","v5.15.83","v5.15.84","v5.15.85","v5.15.86","v5.15.87","v5.15.88","v5.15.89","v5.15.9","v5.15.90","v5.15.91","v5.15.92","v5.15.93","v5.15.94","v5.15.95","v5.15.96","v5.15.97","v5.15.98","v5.15.99","v5.16","v5.16-rc1","v5.16-rc2","v5.16-rc3","v5.16-rc4","v5.16-rc5","v5.16-rc6","v5.16-rc7","v5.16-rc8","v5.17","v5.17-rc1","v5.17-rc2","v5.17-rc3","v5.17-rc4","v5.17-rc5","v5.17-rc6","v5.17-rc7","v5.17-rc8","v5.18","v5.18-rc1","v5.18-rc2","v5.18-rc3","v5.18-rc4","v5.18-rc5","v5.18-rc6","v5.18-rc7","v5.19","v5.19-rc1","v5.19-rc2","v5.19-rc3","v5.19-rc4","v5.19-rc5","v5.19-rc6","v5.19-rc7","v5.19-rc8","v6.0","v6.0-rc1","v6.0-rc2","v6.0-rc3","v6.0-rc4","v6.0-rc5","v6.0-rc6","v6.0-rc7","v6.1","v6.1-rc1","v6.1-rc2","v6.1-rc3","v6.1-rc4","v6.1-rc5","v6.1-rc6","v6.1-rc7","v6.1-rc8","v6.1.1","v6.1.10","v6.1.11","v6.1.12","v6.1.13","v6.1.14","v6.1.15","v6.1.16","v6.1.17","v6.1.18","v6.1.19","v6.1.2","v6.1.20","v6.1.21","v6.1.22","v6.1.23","v6.1.24","v6.1.25","v6.1.26","v6.1.27","v6.1.28","v6.1.29","v6.1.3","v6.1.30","v6.1.4","v6.1.5","v6.1.6","v6.1.7","v6.1.8","v6.1.9","v6.2","v6.2-rc1","v6.2-rc2","v6.2-rc3","v6.2-rc4","v6.2-rc5","v6.2-rc6","v6.2-rc7","v6.2-rc8","v6.3","v6.3-rc1","v6.3-rc2","v6.3-rc3","v6.3-rc4","v6.3-rc5","v6.3-rc6","v6.3-rc7","v6.3.1","v6.3.2","v6.3.3","v6.3.4","v6.4-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53256.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Kernel","ecosystem":"Linux"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.14.0"},{"fixed":"5.15.114"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.16.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.31"}]},{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.2.0"},{"fixed":"6.3.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/CVE-2023-53256.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/19b8766459c41c6f318f8a548cc1c66dffd18363"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/93d0cbe88118fcef234d3ebcbdadcb9ebe9d34f1"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c2f65991097a62efbdb2bed3c06fc86b08c9593b"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dfc5aaa57f52a5800c339369d235fa30fb734feb"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53256.json"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53256"}],"database_specific":{"cna_assigner":"Linux","osv_generated_from":"https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/main/cves/2023/53xxx/CVE-2023-53256.json"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-15T01:09:53.594399Z","source":"linux","ecosystem":"Linux"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"CVE-2023-53352","published":"2025-09-17T14:56:42.698Z","modified":"2026-01-14T22:47:11.855824Z","related":["SUSE-SU-2025:03615-1","SUSE-SU-2025:03628-1","SUSE-SU-2025:3716-1","SUSE-SU-2025:3751-1","SUSE-SU-2025:3761-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4057-1","SUSE-SU-2025:4132-1"],"summary":"drm/ttm:

whether to call drm_sched_fault which unwind\nthe TDR leads to GPU reset.\nHowever it looks the ready condition is overloaded with other meanings,\nfor example, for the following stack is related GPU
