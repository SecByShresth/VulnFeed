If you use the OpenMRS SDK, this will be in the distro.properties file.\n  - Notes: \n    - The newly released [**Platform 2.7**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmrs/files/releases/OpenMRS_Platform_2.7.0/) also includes the fixes. [Release Notes and more download options here](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/wiki/x/XoBzEQ).\n    - Platform 2.6.8+ has most of the fixes, but these are broken if you don't use SSL, so Platform 2.6.11 or higher is preferred.\n    - For those still on Platform 2.5+ such as the Bahmni ecosystem, the new [2.5.14](https://ci.openmrs.org/browse/TRUNK-CORE2-232) release includes the patch. _Bahmni note: The upcoming patch release for both Bahmni Lite and Bahmni Standard will incorporate these security fixes._\n- **Legacy UI** OMOD 1.21.0+ ([here](https://addons.openmrs.org/show/org.openmrs.module.legacyui))\n- **ID Gen** OMOD 4.14.0+ ([here](https://addons.openmrs.org/show/org.openmrs.module.idgen))\n- **Address Hierarchy** OMOD 2.19.0+ ([here](https://addons.openmrs.org/show/org.openmrs.module.addresshierarchy))\n- **Attachments** OMOD 3.6.0+ ([here](https://addons.openmrs.org/show/org.openmrs.module.attachments))\n- **Patient Flags** OMOD 3.0.8+ ([here](https://addons.openmrs.org/show/org.openmrs.module.patientflags))\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no practical workarounds to fix or remediate the vulnerabilities without upgrading. Technically, you could remove the affected OMODs, but this would badly degrade the system's functionality.\n\n## Thank you to our amazing Security contributors!\nThank you to security firm UnderDefense, and to the OpenMRS Security Group contributors for their patch support - specific thanks to Daniel Kayiwa, Samuel Lubwama, Ian Bacher, Rafal Korytkowski, and Michael Seaton. \n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"org.openmrs:openmrs","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.openmrs/openmrs"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.6.11"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.openmrs.module:legacyui","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.openmrs.module/legacyui"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.21.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.openmrs.module:idgen","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.openmrs.module/idgen"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.14.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.openmrs.module:addresshierarchy","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.openmrs.module/addresshierarchy"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.19.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.openmrs.module:attachments","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.openmrs.module/attachments"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.6.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9.json"}},{"package":{"name":"org.openmrs.module:patientflags","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/org.openmrs.module/patientflags"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/01/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/security/advisories/GHSA-vpxm-cr3r-pjp9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-209","CWE-284","CWE-601","CWE-614"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-01-30T17:50:52Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-20T12:34:59.642835Z","source":"maven","ecosystem":"Maven"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-h3j8-fr5q-8rfr","published":"2022-05-24T19:06:05Z","modified":"2024-12-07T05:32:15.136529Z","aliases":["CVE-2021-31649"],"summary":"JFinal Java Deserialization Vulnerability","details":"In applications using jfinal 4.9.08 and below, there is a deserialization vulnerability when using redis which can lead to remote code execution","affected":[{"package":{"name":"com.jfinal:jfinal","ecosystem":"Maven","purl":"pkg:maven/com.jfinal/jfinal"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"4.9.08"}]}],"versions":["1.4","1.4.0","1.5","1.6","1.8","1.9","2.0","2.1","2.2","3.0","3.1","3.2","3.3","3.4","3.5","3.6","3.7","3.8","4.0","4.1","4.2","4.3","4.4","4.5","4.6","4.7","4.8","4.9","4.9.01","4.9.02","4.9.03","4.9.04","4.9.05","4.9.06","4.9.07","4.9.08"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/05/GHSA-h3j8-fr5q-8rfr/GHSA-h3j8-fr5q-8rfr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31649"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/jfinal/jfinal/issues/184"},{"type":"WEB","url":"http://note.youdao.com/noteshare?id=787ccbb8345dbd4a905aebe35f1d8aa8&sub=6C5C072C901949429EFD978405212FA4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-07-11T16:45:32Z","nvd_published_at":"2021-06-24T16:15:00Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-20T12:34:59.520397Z","source":"maven","ecosystem":"Maven"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-qg44-xqwj-wc28","published":"2023-12-15T15:30:27Z","modified":"2024-12-03T06:06:51.288045Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-49898"],"summary":"Apache StreamPark: Authenticated system users could trigger remote command execution","details":"In streampark, there is a project module that integrates Maven's compilation capability.

The affected versions include 5.4.5, 5.5.0, 5.6.2 and 5.7.0. The vulnerability I have found is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195. Recap: Before the fix of CVE-2019-0195 it was possible to download arbitrary class files from the classpath by providing a crafted asset file URL. An attacker was able to download the file `AppModule.class` by requesting the URL `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class` which contains a HMAC secret key. The fix for that bug was a blacklist filter that checks if the URL ends with `.class`, `.properties` or `.xml`. Bypass: Unfortunately, the blacklist solution can simply be bypassed by appending a `/` at the end of the URL: `http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class/` The slash is stripped after the blacklist check and the file `AppModule.class` is loaded into the response. This class usually contains the HMAC secret key which is used to sign serialized Java objects.

Patches\nThis issue has been fixed in version 4.5.1.  Users should use the latest version of this library.  (The latest version is not necessarily 4.5.1.  Check the README for [this library's repository](https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR-Java) to see the latest version's version number.)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAgain, users should use the latest version of this library.\n\nIn the meantime, note that the inputs affected by this issue are all CBOR maps or contain CBOR maps.  An input that decodes to a single CBOR object is not capable of containing a CBOR map if&mdash;\n\n- it begins with a byte other than 0x80 through 0xDF, or\n- it does not contain a byte in the range 0xa0 through 0xBF.\n\nSuch an input is not affected by this vulnerability and an application can choose to perform this check before passing it to a CBOR decoding mechanism.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the CBOR

Versions earlier than 4.0 resolved those references automatically. While this by itself doesn't cause much of a security problem, a denial of service can happen if those references are deeply nested and used multiple times (so that the same reference to the same object occurs multiple times), and if the decoded CBOR object is sent to a serialization method such as EncodeToBytes, ToString, or ToJSONString, since the objects referred to are expanded in the process and take up orders of magnitude more memory than if the references weren't resolved.\n\nThe impact of this problem on any particular system varies. In general, the risk is higher if the system allows users to send arbitrary CBOR objects without authentication, or exposes a remote endpoint in which arbitrary CBOR objects can be sent without authentication.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem is addressed in version 4.0 by disabling reference resolution by default. Users should use the latest version of this library.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSince version 3.6, an encoding option (`resolvereferences=true` or `resolvereferences=false`) in CBOREncodeOptions sets whether the CBOR processor will resolve these kinds of references when decoding a CBOR object. Set `resolvereferences=false` to disable reference resolution.\n\nIn version 3.6, if the method used CBORObject.Read() or CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes() to decode a serialized CBOR object, call the overload that takes CBOREncodeOptions as follows:\n\n    CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes(bytes, new CBOREncodeOptions(\"resolvereferences=false\"));\n\nIn versions 3.5 and earlier, this issue is present only if the CBOR object is an array or a map. If the application does not expect a decoded CBOR object to be an array or a map, it should check the CBOR object's type before encoding that object, as follows:\n\n    if (cbor.Type != CBORType.Array && cbor.Type != CBORType.Map) {\n       cbor.EncodeToBytes();\n    }\n\nAlternatively, for such versions, the application can use WriteTo to decode the CBOR object to a so-called \"limited memory stream\", that is, a Stream that throws an exception if too many bytes would be written. How to write such a limited-memory stream is nontrivial and beyond the scope of this advisory.\n\n    LimitedMemoryStream stream = new LimitedMemoryStream(100000); // Limit to 100000 bytes\n    cbor.WriteTo(stream);\n    return stream.ToBytes();\n\nTo check whether a byte array representing a CBOR object might exhibit this problem, check whether the array contains the byte 0xd8 followed immediately by either 0x19 or 0x1d. This check catches all affected CBOR objects but may catch some non-affected CBOR objects (notably integers and byte strings).\n\n### References\n\nSee the Wikipedia article [Billion laughs
