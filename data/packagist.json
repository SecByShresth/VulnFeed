Insufficient Permission Verification\n\nIn Grav CMS, \"[Frontmatter](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/content/headers)\" refers to the metadata block located at the top of a Markdown file. Frontmatter serves the purpose of providing additional information about a specific page or post.\nIn this feature, only administrators are granted access, while regular users who can create pages are not. However, if a regular user adds the data[_json][header][form] parameter to the POST Body while creating a page, they can use Frontmatter. The demonstration of this vulnerability is provided in video format. [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU1QA0idoWE)\n\n2. Inadequate File Name Validation\n\nTo create a Contact Form, Frontmatter and markdown can be written as follows:\n[Contact Form Example](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/forms/forms/example-form)\n[Form Action Save Option](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/forms/forms/reference-form-actions#save)\nWhen an external user submits the Contact Form after filling it out, the data is stored in the user/data folder. The filename under which the data is stored corresponds to the value specified in the filename attribute of the process property. For instance, if the filename attribute has a value of \"feedback.txt,\" a feedback.txt file is created in the user/data/contact folder. This file contains the value entered by the user in the \"name\" field. The problem with this functionality is the lack of validation for the filename attribute, potentially allowing the creation of files such as phar files on the server. An attacker could input arbitrary PHP code into the \"name\" field to be saved on the server. However, Grav filter the < and > characters, so to disable these options, an xss_check: false attribute should be added. [Disable XSS](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/forms/forms/form-options#xss-checks)\n\n```\n---\ntitle: Contact Form\n\nform:\n    name: contact\n    xss_check: false\n\n    fields:\n        name:\n          label: Name\n          placeholder: Enter your name\n          autocomplete: on\n          type: text\n          validate:\n            required: true\n\n    buttons:\n        submit:\n          type: submit\n          value: Submit\n\n    process:\n        save:\n            filename: this_is_file_name.phar\n            operation: add\n\n---\n\n# Contact form\n\nSome sample page content\n```\n\nExploiting these two vulnerabilities allows the following scenario:\n\n- A regular user account capable of creating pages is required.\n- An attacker creates a Contact Form page containing malicious Frontmatter using the regular user's account.\n- Accessing the Contact Form page, the attacker submits PHP code.\n- The attacker attempts Remote Code Execution by accessing HOST/user/data/[form-name]/[filename].\n\n### PoC\n\n[PoC Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh3ezpORbPc)\n\n```python\n# PoC.py\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nclass

In the case of SAML authentication responses, correctly verifying the signature is critical to trust that the assertion contained inside the response was issued by a trusted third-party and the identity of the subject has been properly verified.\n\nA SAML message can be signed both at the message level and at the assertion level (if the message is an authentication response). When the whole authentication response message is unsigned, all the assertions contained inside must be signed independently in order to verify their authenticity. Failure to properly verify the authenticity of the entire message or individual assertions leads to the ability of an attacker to impersonate any user from any Identity Provider trusted by the Service Provider.\n\n### Description\nA signature validation bypass issue has been found in the `SimpleSAML_XML_Validator` class. This class performs the verification of the XML digital signature of a SAML 1 message with a given key.\n\nWhen a SAML 1 authentication response message is received, it is processed to verify its authenticity, including a check for the signature or signatures included in the message. If the message is not signed but the assertions contained in it are, the signatures of those assertions signed will be verified. Unsigned assertions will not be verified. After verifying every signed element in the response, a list of valid nodes is built, holding the DOM nodes of those XML elements that are signed and whose signatures have been successfully verified.\n\nOnce this list is built, the assertions need to be processed individually. They are not processed until the getAttributes() method of the SimpleSAML_XML_Shib13_AuthnResponse class is called. This method iterates through the list of assertions contained in the response and makes sure they were validated in the previous signature verification step, by checking if their corresponding DOM nodes are in the list of those verified.\n\nThe vulnerability is due to lax comparison of the node being checked and the nodes in the verified list. The isNodeValidated() method of the SimpleSAML_XML_Validator class checks if a given DOM node is in the validNodes array by means of the standard in_array() function. This function, however, will return unexpected results due to the default lax behaviour when checking data types in PHP. In this case, the fact that there is a DOM node in the list is enough for in_array() to return true when looking for any DOM node. This means any unsigned assertion will be considered verified if there is at least one assertion with a valid signature in the message being processed.\n\nThis issue allows an attacker to generate a SAML 1 authentication response that contains two different assertions. The first assertion is the one the attacker wants the Service Provider to use, with custom attributes, expiration and even entityID (provided that the given entityID belongs to an Identity Provider that the Service Provider knows and trusts). The second is a legitimate assertion issued and signed by an Identity Provider trusted by the Service Provider. If the second assertion is still valid when sent by the attacker, SimpleSAMLphp will merge all the attributes found in both assertions, but the entityID registered for the authenticating third-party will be the one found in the first, tampered assertion. If the second (legitimate) assertion is already expired when the attacker sends it, only the attributes found in the tampered assertion will be used.\n\nThe issue can be easily fixed by passing a third parameter to the in_array() function, telling it to perform strict comparisons when checking if an object is found inside a given array. This way, when the code evaluates if the tampered assertion is included in the list of verified assertions, it fails and only the legitimate assertion is used, if possible (e.g. it is not expired).\n\n### Affected versions\nAll SimpleSAMLphp versions before and including 1.14.16.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can leverage this vulnerability to impersonate any user from any SAML 1 Identity Provider trusted by a SimpleSAMLphp Service Provider, with the only pre-requisite of a valid assertion previously sent to the affected Service Provider. As such, only those SimpleSAMLphp installations that have metadata deployed for SAML 1 Identity Providers (by default, listed in the metadata/shib13-idp-remote.php file, but could be in other locations depending on your local configuration) are affected.\n\n### Resolution\nUpgrade to the latest version. When an upgrade is not possible immediately, the following patch must be applied:\n```\ndiff --git a/lib/SimpleSAML/XML/Validator.php b/lib/SimpleSAML/XML/Validator.php\nindex e4877f0..69236ef 100644\n--- a/lib/SimpleSAML/XML/Validator.php\n+++ b/lib/SimpleSAML/XML/Validator.php\n@@ -260,7 +260,7 @@ class SimpleSAML_XML_Validator {\n                assert('$node instanceof DOMNode');\n\n                while($node !== NULL) {\n-                       if(in_array($node, $this->validNodes)) {\n+                       if(in_array($node, $this->validNodes, true)) {\n                                return TRUE;\n                        }\n\n```","affected":[{"package":{"name":"simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"1.12.0"},{"fixed":"1.14.17"}]}],"versions":["v1.12.0","v1.13.0","v1.13.0-rc1","v1.13.0-rc2","v1.13.1","v1.13.2","v1.14.0","v1.14.0-rc1","v1.14.1","v1.14.10","v1.14.11","v1.14.12","v1.14.13","v1.14.14","v1.14.15","v1.14.16","v1.14.2","v1.14.3","v1.14.4","v1.14.5","v1.14.6","v1.14.7","v1.14.8","v1.14.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-fjr2-r2mp-484p/GHSA-fjr2-r2mp-484p.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/commit/e2d53086abbb253efb24ddcb49b116246eb0b6ca"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/201710-01.yaml"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://simplesamlphp.org/security/201710-01"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-05-28T19:29:37Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:30:15.977891Z","source":"packagist","ecosystem":"Packagist"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-9h9q-qhxg-89xr","published":"2024-09-27T20:51:01Z","modified":"2024-12-03T06:01:09.716886Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-47186"],"summary":"Filament has unvalidated ColorColumn and ColorEntry values that can be used for Cross-site Scripting","details":"### Summary\n\nIf values passed to a `ColorColumn` or `ColumnEntry` are not valid and contain a specific set of characters, applications are vulnerable to XSS attack against a user who opens a page on which a color column or entry is rendered.\n\nVersions of Filament from v3.0.0 through v3.2.114 are affected.\n\nPlease upgrade to Filament [v3.2.115](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/releases/tag/v3.2.115).\n\n### PoC\n\nFor example, using a value such as:\n\n```html\nblue;\"><script>alert('There\\'s a security problem here')</script style=\"\n```\n\nWould get passed into the `@style()` Blade directive from Laravel to render the correct background color, where `$state` contains the value:\n\n```blade\n<div @style([\n    \"background-color: {$state}\" => $state,\n])></div>\n```\n\nSince Laravel does not escape special characters within the `@style` Blade directive, the effective output HTML would be:\n\n```html\n<div style=\"background-color: blue;\"><script>alert('There\\'s a security problem here')</script style=\"\"></div>\n```\n\nCreating the opportunity for arbitrary JS to run if it was stored in the database.\n\n### Response\n\nThis vulnerability (in `ColorColumn` only) was reported by @sv-LayZ, who reported the issue and patched the issue during the evening of 25/09/2024. Thank you Mattis.\n\nThe review process concluded on 27/09/2024, which revealed the issue was also present in `ColorEntry`. This was fixed the same day and Filament [v3.2.115](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/releases/tag/v3.2.115) followed to escape any special characters while outputting inline styles like this:\n\n```blade\n<div @style([\n    'background-color: ' . e($state) => $state,\n])></div>\n```\n\nAlthough these components are no longer vulnerable to this type of XSS attack, it is good practice to validate colors, and since many Filament users may be accepting color input using the `ColorPicker` form component, [additional color validation documentation was published](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/forms/fields/color-picker#color-picker-validation).","affected":[{"package":{"name":"filament/tables","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/filament/tables"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.2.115"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.100","v3.0.101","v3.0.102","v3.0.103","v3.0.11","v3.0.12","v3.0.13","v3.0.14","v3.0.15","v3.0.16","v3.0.17","v3.0.18","v3.0.19","v3.0.2","v3.0.20","v3.0.21","v3.0.22","v3.0.23","v3.0.24","v3.0.25","v3.0.26","v3.0.27","v3.0.28","v3.0.29","v3.0.3","v3.0.30","v3.0.31","v3.0.32","v3.0.33","v3.0.34","v3.0.35","v3.0.36","v3.0.37","v3.0.38","v3.0.39","v3.0.4","v3.0.40","v3.0.41","v3.0.42","v3.0.43","v3.0.44","v3.0.45","v3.0.46","v3.0.47","v3.0.48","v3.0.49","v3.0.5","v3.0.50","v3.0.51","v3.0.52","v3.0.53","v3.0.54","v3.0.55","v3.0.56","v3.0.57","v3.0.58","v3.0.59","v3.0.6","v3.0.60","v3.0.61","v3.0.62","v3.0.63","v3.0.64","v3.0.65","v3.0.66","v3.0.67","v3.0.68","v3.0.69","v3.0.7","v3.0.70","v3.0.71","v3.0.72","v3.0.73","v3.0.74","v3.0.75","v3.0.76","v3.0.77","v3.0.78","v3.0.79","v3.0.8","v3.0.80","v3.0.81","v3.0.82","v3.0.83","v3.0.84","v3.0.85","v3.0.86","v3.0.87","v3.0.88","v3.0.89","v3.0.9","v3.0.90","v3.0.91","v3.0.92","v3.0.93","v3.0.94","v3.0.95","v3.0.96","v3.0.97","v3.0.98","v3.0.99","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-alpha1","v3.1.0-alpha2","v3.1.0-alpha3","v3.1.0-alpha4","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.11","v3.1.12","v3.1.13","v3.1.14","v3.1.15","v3.1.16","v3.1.17","v3.1.18","v3.1.19","v3.1.2","v3.1.20","v3.1.21","v3.1.22","v3.1.23","v3.1.24","v3.1.25","v3.1.26","v3.1.27","v3.1.28","v3.1.29","v3.1.3","v3.1.30","v3.1.31","v3.1.32","v3.1.33","v3.1.34","v3.1.35","v3.1.36","v3.1.37","v3.1.39","v3.1.4","v3.1.40","v3.1.41","v3.1.42","v3.1.43","v3.1.44","v3.1.45","v3.1.46","v3.1.47","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2.0","v3.2.1","v3.2.10","v3.2.100","v3.2.101","v3.2.102","v3.2.103","v3.2.104","v3.2.105","v3.2.106","v3.2.107","v3.2.108","v3.2.109","v3.2.11","v3.2.110","v3.2.111","v3.2.112","v3.2.113","v3.2.114","v3.2.12","v3.2.13","v3.2.14","v3.2.15","v3.2.16","v3.2.17","v3.2.18","v3.2.19","v3.2.2","v3.2.20","v3.2.21","v3.2.22","v3.2.23","v3.2.24","v3.2.25","v3.2.25-beta1","v3.2.26","v3.2.27","v3.2.28","v3.2.29","v3.2.3","v3.2.30","v3.2.31","v3.2.32","v3.2.33","v3.2.34","v3.2.35","v3.2.36","v3.2.37","v3.2.38","v3.2.39","v3.2.4","v3.2.40","v3.2.41","v3.2.42","v3.2.43","v3.2.44","v3.2.45","v3.2.46","v3.2.47","v3.2.48","v3.2.49","v3.2.5","v3.2.50","v3.2.51","v3.2.52","v3.2.53","v3.2.54","v3.2.55","v3.2.56","v3.2.57","v3.2.58","v3.2.59","v3.2.6","v3.2.60","v3.2.61","v3.2.62","v3.2.63","v3.2.64","v3.2.65","v3.2.66","v3.2.67","v3.2.68","v3.2.69","v3.2.7","v3.2.70","v3.2.71","v3.2.72","v3.2.73","v3.2.74","v3.2.75","v3.2.76","v3.2.77","v3.2.78","v3.2.79","v3.2.8","v3.2.80","v3.2.81","v3.2.82","v3.2.83","v3.2.84","v3.2.85","v3.2.86","v3.2.87","v3.2.87-beta1","v3.2.88","v3.2.89","v3.2.9","v3.2.90","v3.2.91","v3.2.92","v3.2.93","v3.2.94","v3.2.95","v3.2.96","v3.2.97","v3.2.98","v3.2.99"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-9h9q-qhxg-89xr/GHSA-9h9q-qhxg-89xr.json"}},{"package":{"name":"filament/infolists","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/filament/infolists"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.2.115"}]}],"versions":["v3.0.0","v3.0.1","v3.0.10","v3.0.100","v3.0.101","v3.0.102","v3.0.103","v3.0.11","v3.0.12","v3.0.13","v3.0.14","v3.0.15","v3.0.16","v3.0.17","v3.0.18","v3.0.19","v3.0.2","v3.0.20","v3.0.21","v3.0.22","v3.0.23","v3.0.24","v3.0.25","v3.0.26","v3.0.27","v3.0.28","v3.0.29","v3.0.3","v3.0.30","v3.0.31","v3.0.32","v3.0.33","v3.0.34","v3.0.35","v3.0.36","v3.0.37","v3.0.38","v3.0.39","v3.0.4","v3.0.40","v3.0.41","v3.0.42","v3.0.43","v3.0.44","v3.0.45","v3.0.46","v3.0.47","v3.0.48","v3.0.49","v3.0.5","v3.0.50","v3.0.51","v3.0.52","v3.0.53","v3.0.54","v3.0.55","v3.0.56","v3.0.57","v3.0.58","v3.0.59","v3.0.6","v3.0.60","v3.0.61","v3.0.62","v3.0.63","v3.0.64","v3.0.65","v3.0.66","v3.0.67","v3.0.68","v3.0.69","v3.0.7","v3.0.70","v3.0.71","v3.0.72","v3.0.73","v3.0.74","v3.0.75","v3.0.76","v3.0.77","v3.0.78","v3.0.79","v3.0.8","v3.0.80","v3.0.81","v3.0.82","v3.0.83","v3.0.84","v3.0.85","v3.0.86","v3.0.87","v3.0.88","v3.0.89","v3.0.9","v3.0.90","v3.0.91","v3.0.92","v3.0.93","v3.0.94","v3.0.95","v3.0.96","v3.0.97","v3.0.98","v3.0.99","v3.1.0","v3.1.0-alpha1","v3.1.0-alpha2","v3.1.0-alpha3","v3.1.0-alpha4","v3.1.1","v3.1.10","v3.1.11","v3.1.12","v3.1.13","v3.1.14","v3.1.15","v3.1.16","v3.1.17","v3.1.18","v3.1.19","v3.1.2","v3.1.20","v3.1.21","v3.1.22","v3.1.23","v3.1.24","v3.1.25","v3.1.26","v3.1.27","v3.1.28","v3.1.29","v3.1.3","v3.1.30","v3.1.31","v3.1.32","v3.1.33","v3.1.34","v3.1.35","v3.1.36","v3.1.37","v3.1.39","v3.1.4","v3.1.40","v3.1.41","v3.1.42","v3.1.43","v3.1.44","v3.1.45","v3.1.46","v3.1.47","v3.1.5","v3.1.6","v3.1.7","v3.1.8","v3.1.9","v3.2.0","v3.2.1"

Since we have not yet released a security release for the Laravel 5.5 version of the framework, we recommend that all applications running Laravel 5.5 and earlier do not use the \"cookie\" session driver in their production deployments.\n\nRegarding the vulnerability, applications using the \"cookie\" session driver that were also exposing an encryption oracle via their application were vulnerable to remote code execution. An encryption oracle is a mechanism where arbitrary user input is encrypted and the encrypted string is later displayed or exposed to the user. This combination of scenarios lets the user generate valid Laravel signed encryption strings for any plain-text string, thus allowing them to craft Laravel session payloads when an application is using the \"cookie\" driver.\n\nThis fix prefixes cookie values with an HMAC hash of the cookie's name before encryption and then verifies a matching hash on decryption, making it impossible to craft a valid cookie payload even if an encryption oracle is exposed via the application.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"illuminate/cookie","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/illuminate/cookie"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.1.0"},{"fixed":"6.18.31"}]}],"versions":["5.7.17","5.7.18","5.7.19","v4.1.0","v4.1.1","v4.1.10","v4.1.11","v4.1.12","v4.1.13","v4.1.14","v4.1.15","v4.1.16","v4.1.17","v4.1.18","v4.1.19","v4.1.2","v4.1.20","v4.1.21","v4.1.22","v4.1.23","v4.1.24","v4.1.25","v4.1.26","v4.1.27","v4.1.28","v4.1.29","v4.1.3","v4.1.30","v4.1.4","v4.1.5","v4.1.6","v4.1.7","v4.1.8","v4.1.9","v4.2.0-BETA1","v4.2.1","v4.2.12","v4.2.16","v4.2.17","v4.2.2","v4.2.3","v4.2.4","v4.2.5","v4.2.6","v4.2.7","v4.2.8","v4.2.9","v5.0.0","v5.0.22","v5.0.25","v5.0.26","v5.0.28","v5.0.33","v5.0.4","v5.1.1","v5.1.13","v5.1.16","v5.1.2","v5.1.20","v5.1.22","v5.1.25","v5.1.28","v5.1.30","v5.1.31","v5.1.41","v5.1.6","v5.1.8","v5.2.0","v5.2.19","v5.2.21","v5.2.24","v5.2.25","v5.2.26","v5.2.27","v5.2.28","v5.2.31","v5.2.32","v5.2.37","v5.2.43","v5.2.45","v5.2.6","v5.2.7","v5.3.0","v5.3.16","v5.3.23","v5.3.4","v5.4.0","v5.4.13","v5.4.17","v5.4.19","v5.4.27","v5.4.36","v5.4.9","v5.5.0","v5.5.16","v5.5.17","v5.5.2","v5.5.28","v5.5.33","v5.5.34","v5.5.35","v5.5.36","v5.5.37","v5.5.39","v5.5.40","v5.5.41","v5.5.43","v5.5.44","v5.6.0","v5.6.1","v5.6.10","v5.6.11","v5.6.12","v5.6.13","v5.6.14","v5.6.15","v5.6.16","v5.6.17","v5.6.19","v5.6.2","v5.6.20","v5.6.21","v5.6.22","v5.6.23","v5.6.24","v5.6.25","v5.6.26","v5.6.27","v5.6.28","v5.6.29","v5.6.3","v5.6.30","v5.6.31","v5.6.32","v5.6.33","v5.6.34","v5.6.35","v5.6.36","v5.6.37","v5.6.38","v5.6.39","v5.6.4","v5.6.5","v5.6.6","v5.6.7","v5.6.8","v5.6.9","v5.7.0","v5.7.1","v5.7.10","v5.7.11","v5.7.15","v5.7.2","v5.7.20","v5.7.21","v5.7.22","v5.7.23","v5.7.26","v5.7.27","v5.7.28","v5.7.3","v5.7.4","v5.7.5","v5.7.6","v5.7.7","v5.7.8","v5.7.9","v5.8.0","v5.8.11","v5.8.12","v5.8.14","v5.8.15","v5.8.17","v5.8.18","v5.8.19","v5.8.2","v5.8.20","v5.8.22","v5.8.24","v5.8.27","v5.8.28","v5.8.29","v5.8.3","v5.8.30","v5.8.31","v5.8.32","v5.8.33","v5.8.34","v5.8.35","v5.8.36","v5.8.4","v5.8.8","v5.8.9","v6.0.0","v6.0.1","v6.0.2","v6.0.3","v6.0.4","v6.1.0","v6.10.0","v6.11.0","v6.12.0","v6.13.0","v6.13.1","v6.14.0","v6.15.0","v6.15.1","v6.16.0","v6.17.0","v6.17.1","v6.18.0","v6.18.1","v6.18.10","v6.18.11","v6.18.12","v6.18.13","v6.18.14","v6.18.15","v6.18.16","v6.18.17","v6.18.18","v6.18.19","v6.18.2","v6.18.20","v6.18.21","v6.18.22","v6.18.23","v6.18.24","v6.18.25","v6.18.26","v6.18.27","v6.18.28","v6.18.29","v6.18.3","v6.18.30","v6.18.4","v6.18.5","v6.18.6","v6.18.7","v6.18.8","v6.18.9","v6.2.0","v6.3.0","v6.4.1","v6.5.0","v6.5.1","v6.5.2","v6.6.0","v6.6.1","v6.6.2","v6.7.0","v6.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-2ffv-r4r9-r8xr/GHSA-2ffv-r4r9-r8xr.json"}},{"package":{"name":"illuminate/cookie","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/illuminate/cookie"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"7.0.0"},{"fixed":"7.22.4"}]}],"versions":["v7.0.0","v7.0.1","v7.0.2","v7.0.3","v7.0.4","v7.0.5","v7.0.6","v7.0.7","v7.0.8","v7.1.0","v7.1.1","v7.1.2","v7.1.3","v7.10.0","v7.10.1","v7.10.2","v7.10.3","v7.11.0","v7.12.0","v7.13.0","v7.14.0","v7.14.1","v7.15.0","v7.16.0","v7.16.1","v7.17.0","v7.17.1","v7.17.2","v7.18.0","v7.19.0","v7.19.1","v7.2.0","v7.2.1","v7.2.2","v7.20.0","v7.21.0","v7.22.0","v7.22.1","v7.22.2","v7.22.3","v7.3.0","v7.4.0","v7.5.0","v7.5.1","v7.5.2","v7.6.0","v7.6.1","v7.6.2","v7.7.0","v7.7.1","v7.8.0","v7.8.1","v7.9.0","v7.9.1","v7.9.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-2ffv-r4r9-r8xr/GHSA-2ffv-r4r9-r8xr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://blog.laravel.com/laravel-cookie-security-releases"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/illuminate/cookie/2020-07-27-1.yaml"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/illuminate/cookie"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-05-15T21:52:29Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:30:15.836274Z","source":"packagist","ecosystem":"Packagist"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-jjx7-8462-w4m4","published":"2024-05-15T20:57:20Z","modified":"2024-11-29T05:45:01.013296Z","summary":"Drupal

The issue arises from improper sanitation of user input. Everyone who accesses this page will be affected by this attack.\n\n### Details\n\nThe function `lgsl_query_40` in `lgsl_protocol.php` has implemented an HTTP crawler. This function makes a request to the registered game server, and upon crawling the malicious `/info` endpoint with our payload, will render our javascript on the info page. This information is being displayed via `lgsl_details.php`\n\n#### Affected Code:\n```php\n      foreach ($server['e'] as $field => $value) {\n        $value = preg_replace('/((https*:\\/\\/|https*:\\/\\/www\\.|www\\.)[\\w\\d\\.\\-\\/=$?​]*)/i', \"<a href='$1' target='_blank'>$1</a>\", html_entity_decode($value));\n        $output .= \"\n        <tr><td> {$field} </td><td> {$value} </td></tr>\";\n      }\n```\n### PoC\n\n1. Create a game server with type `eco` and set the target host and port accordingly to your ttack server. I have crafted this json payload that is being parsed according to the schema and being served on `/info` \n\n2. Serve the following JSON payload at `/info` on your handler\n```json\n{\n  \"Animals\": \"1\",\n  \"EconomyDesc\": \"<img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>\"\n}\n```\n3. Access the corresponding server info page at `/s?=`.

named constructor discovery in Valinor","details":"## Design issue - automatic constructor discovery\n\nThe issue arises when upgrading from `cuyz/valinor:0.3.0` to a newer system on an existing application, which broke due to the wrong constructor being picked.\n\nStill, a bigger security concern is problematic, and it is akin to https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5228.\n\n## Example exploit\n\nTake following DTO example:\n\n```php\nfinal class UserDTO\n{\n    public function __construct(\n        public int $id,\n        public string $name\n    ) {}\n    public static function fromDb(\n        PDO $connection,\n        int $id\n    ): self { /* ... code to fetch the DTO here ... */ }\n}\n```\n\nThere is nothing inherently unsafe about the above `UserDTO`, but when mixed with `cuyz/valinor:^0.5.0` ( specifically https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/commit/718d3c1bc2ea7d28b4b1f6c062addcd1dde8660b ), it is an explosive mix:\n\n```php\n// this could be coming from user input:\n$maliciousPayload = [\n    'connection' => [\n      'dsn' => 'mysql:host=some-host;database=some-database',\n      'username' => 'root',\n      'password' => 'root',\n      'options' => [\n        // PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND === 1002\n        1002 => 'DROP DATABASE all-the-moneys'\n      ]\n    ],\n    'id' => 123,\n];\n\n$treeMapper->map(\n  UserDTO::class,\n  $maliciousPayload\n); // your DB is gone :D\n```\n\nThe above payload is represented in PHP form, but may as well be input JSON, HTML or x-form-urlencoded.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nVersion 0.7.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n\nAutomatic named constructor resolution should be disabled - only explicitly mapped named constructors should be used/discovered.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"cuyz/valinor","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/cuyz/valinor"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0.5.0"},{"fixed":"0.7.0"}]}],"versions":["0.5.0","0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/04/GHSA-xhr8-mpwq-2rr2/GHSA-xhr8-mpwq-2rr2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/security/advisories/GHSA-xhr8-mpwq-2rr2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/commit/718d3c1bc2ea7d28b4b1f6c062addcd1dde8660b"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/releases/tag/0.7.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-04-01T13:39:45Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:30:16.126379Z","source":"packagist","ecosystem":"Packagist"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-gm5q-2cx5-wr2j","published":"2022-05-01T23:57:57Z","modified":"2024-12-05T05:27:02.809836Z","aliases":["CVE-2008-3227"],"summary":"Joomla!

Some users assumed this is a planned feature but it is not. A workspace preview should be an additional feature with respective security measures in place.\n\nNote that this only allows reading of internal workspaces not writing. And for clarification, an internal workspace is a workspace that is non public and doesn't have an owner.\n\nGiven that an internal workspace exists in your installation, it is possible to view a page in context of that workspace by opening a link in this format:\n\nhttps://domain/path/to/page.html@workspace-name\n\nThe issue is quite problematic when exploited but at the same time slightly less impactful than it sounds. First of all there is no default internal workspace, so the issue affects only workspaces created by users. That also means the workspace-name, which will also always include a hash is individual to a project and an exploiter must get hold of the workspace-name including the hash. This is non trivial as there is no indication of the existence of it, but obviously brute force and educated guessed can be made.\n\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"2.3.0"},{"fixed":"2.3.99"}]}],"versions":["2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.10","2.3.11","2.3.12","2.3.13","2.3.14","2.3.15","2.3.16","2.3.17","2.3.18","2.3.19","2.3.2","2.3.20","2.3.21","2.3.22","2.3.23","2.3.24","2.3.25","2.3.26","2.3.27","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.3.8","2.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.0.0"},{"fixed":"3.0.20"}]}],"versions":["3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.10","3.0.11","3.0.12","3.0.13","3.0.14","3.0.15","3.0.16","3.0.17","3.0.18","3.0.19","3.0.2","3.0.3","3.0.4","3.0.5","3.0.6","3.0.7","3.0.8","3.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.1.0"},{"fixed":"3.1.18"}]}],"versions":["3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.10","3.1.11","3.1.12","3.1.13","3.1.14","3.1.15","3.1.16","3.1.17","3.1.2","3.1.3","3.1.4","3.1.5","3.1.6","3.1.7","3.1.8","3.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.2.0"},{"fixed":"3.2.14"}]}],"versions":["3.2.0","3.2.1","3.2.10","3.2.11","3.2.12","3.2.13","3.2.2","3.2.3","3.2.4","3.2.5","3.2.6","3.2.7","3.2.8","3.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"3.3.0"},{"fixed":"3.3.23"}]}],"versions":["3.3.0","3.3.1","3.3.10","3.3.11","3.3.12","3.3.13","3.3.14","3.3.15","3.3.16","3.3.17","3.3.18","3.3.19","3.3.2","3.3.20","3.3.21","3.3.22","3.3.3","3.3.4","3.3.5","3.3.6","3.3.7","3.3.8","3.3.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.0.17"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.0.10","4.0.11","4.0.12","4.0.13","4.0.14","4.0.15","4.0.16","4.0.2","4.0.3","4.0.4","4.0.5","4.0.6","4.0.7","4.0.8","4.0.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.1.0"},{"fixed":"4.1.16"}]}],"versions":["4.1.0","4.1.1","4.1.10","4.1.11","4.1.12","4.1.13","4.1.14","4.1.15","4.1.2","4.1.3","4.1.4","4.1.5","4.1.6","4.1.7","4.1.8","4.1.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.2.0"},{"fixed":"4.2.12"}]}],"versions":["4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.10","4.2.11","4.2.2","4.2.3","4.2.4","4.2.5","4.2.6","4.2.8","4.2.9"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}},{"package":{"name":"typo3/neos","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/typo3/neos"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.3.0"},{"fixed":"4.3.3"}]}],"versions":["4.3.0","4.3.1","4.3.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/06/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2/GHSA-g4xv-r3qw-v3q2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/neos/2019-06-17.yaml"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mneuhaus/TYPO3.Neos"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.neos.io/blog/neos-workspace-disclosure-security.html"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-06-05T18:33:01Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:30:15.986056Z","source":"packagist","ecosyste

These may contain XSS exploits which will be run when links to them are accessed by victims.\n\n### Patches\nThe fix consists simply of adding common types of scriptable file types to the configuration of the already existing filetype blacklist feature. See \"Patched versions\". As such, this can also be done manually, without installing the patched versions. This may be relevant if you are currently running a considerably older version of the kernel package and don't want to upgrade it at this time. Please see the settting \"ezsettings.default.io.file_storage.file_type_blacklist\" at:\nhttps://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-kernel/blob/master/eZ/Bundle/EzPublishCoreBundle/Resources/config/default_settings.yml#L109\n\n### Important note\nYou should adapt this setting to your needs.

For that reason, and given the old age of the software, and manpower issues during the Coronavirus crisis, we are taking the unusual step of simply removing the affected file.

An attacker would need access to uploading files to be able to exploit the vulnerability, so if you have strict controls on this and trust all who have this permission, you're not affected. On the basis of the tests we have made, we also believe the vulnerability cannot be exploited as long as our recommended vhost configuration is used. Here is the v2.5 recommendation for Nginx, as an example:\n\nhttps://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/2.5/doc/nginx/vhost.template#L31\n\nThis vhost template specifies that only the file app.php in the web root is executed, while vulnerable configurations allow execution of any php file. Apache is affected in the same way as Nginx, and is also protected by using the recommended configuration. The build-in webserver in PHP stays vulnerable, as it doesn't use this type of configuration (this webserver should only be used for development, never for production). We cannot be 100% certain our configuration is not vulnerable. We also do not know if all our users use the recommended configuration, so we send out this fix to be on the safe side.\n\nThe fix includes a blacklist feature for uploaded filenames, such as \".php\". The file types on the blacklist cannot be uploaded. The blacklist is configurable. In eZ Platform you will find it as ezsettings.default.io.file_storage.file_type_blacklist in eZ/Bundle/EzPublishCoreBundle/Resources/config/default_settings.yml in vendors/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel. In eZ Publish Legacy you will find it as FileExtensionBlackList in settings/file.ini. By default it blocks these file types: php, php3, phar, phpt, pht, phtml, pgif. The fix also inclues a new block against path traversal attacks, though this kind of attack was not reproducible in our tests.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"7.5.0"},{"fixed":"7.5.6.2"}]}],"versions":["v7.5.0","v7.5.1","v7.5.2","v7.5.3","v7.5.4","v7.5.5","v7.5.6","v7.5.6-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-3vwr-jj4f-h98x/GHSA-3vwr-jj4f-h98x.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"6.13.0"},{"fixed":"6.13.6.2"}]}],"versions":["v6.13.0","v6.13.0.1","v6.13.1","v6.13.1-rc1","v6.13.1.1","v6.13.1.2","v6.13.2","v6.13.2-beta1","v6.13.2-rc1","v6.13.3","v6.13.3-beta1","v6.13.3-rc1","v6.13.4","v6.13.4-beta1","v6.13.4-rc1","v6.13.5","v6.13.5.1","v6.13.6","v6.13.6-rc1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-3vwr-jj4f-h98x/GHSA-3vwr-jj4f-h98x.json"}},{"package":{"name":"ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"5.4.0"},{"fixed":"5.4.14.1"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/05/GHSA-3vwr-jj4f-h98x/GHSA-3vwr-jj4f-h98x.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://ezplatform.com/security-advisories/ezsa-2020-001-remote-code-execution-in-file-uploads"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/2020-03-03-1.yaml"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20210304031629/https://developers.ibexa.co/security-advisories/ezsa-2020-001-remote-code-execution-in-file-uploads"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-94"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-05-15T21:19:07Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:30:15.860037Z","source":"packagist","ecosystem":"Packagist"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-6jvx-8ch9-j2jr","published":"2024-05-15T22:15:07Z","modified":"2024-11-29T05:41:04.000865Z","summary":"Laravel Cookie serialization vulnerability","details":"Laravel 5.6.30 is a security release of Laravel and is recommended as an immediate upgrade for all users.

An attacker would need access to uploading files to be able to exploit the vulnerability, so if you have strict controls on this and trust all who have this permission, you're not affected. On the basis of the tests we have made, we also believe the vulnerability cannot be exploited as long as our recommended vhost configuration is used. Here is the v2.5 recommendation for Nginx, as an example:\n\nhttps://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform/blob/2.5/doc/nginx/vhost.template#L31\n\nThis vhost template specifies that only the file app.php in the web root is executed, while vulnerable configurations allow execution of any php file. Apache is affected in the same way as Nginx, and is also protected by using the recommended configuration. The build-in webserver in PHP stays vulnerable, as it doesn't use this type of configuration (this webserver should only be used for development, never for production). We cannot be 100% certain our configuration is not vulnerable. We also do not know if all our users use the recommended configuration, so we send out this fix to be on the safe side.\n\nThe fix includes a blacklist feature for uploaded filenames, such as \".php\". The file types on the blacklist cannot be uploaded. The blacklist is configurable. In eZ Platform you will find it as ezsettings.default.io.file_storage.file_type_blacklist in eZ/Bundle/EzPublishCoreBundle/Resources/config/default_settings.yml in vendors/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel. In eZ Publish Legacy you will find it as FileExtensionBlackList in settings/file.ini. By default it blocks these file types: php, php3, phar, phpt, pht, phtml, pgif.

Such changes can potentially lead to XSS attacks (if a fully-qualified URL is used in links) and/or URL poisoning.\n\n### Patches\n\n3.7.0, and 4.3.0 and later.\n\nThe patches present in these versions update the `SwooleServerRequestFactory` to filter out `X-Forwarded-*` headers when creating the initial request. They then by default pass that instance through a `Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFilter\\FilterUsingXForwardedHeaders` instance created from the `trustReservedSubnet()` constructor, ensuring that the request only honors the `X-Forwarded-*` headers for private reserved subnets.\n\nUsers can define the `Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFilter\\FilterServerRequestInterface` service if they wish to provide a different implementation, or configure the `FilterUsingXForwardedHeaders` instance differently. When defined, that instance will be used to filter the generated request instance.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInfrastructure or DevOps can place a trusted reverse proxy in front of the mezzio-swoole server.\n\n### References\n\n- [HTTP Host Header Attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in [mezzio/mezzio-swoole](https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-swoole/)\n- [Email us](mailto:security@getlaminas.org)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mezzio/mezzio-swoole","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/mezzio/mezzio-swoole"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.7.0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.1.1","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.4","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.5.0","2.6.0","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.6.5","2.6.6","2.7.0","2.8.0","2.8.1","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.1.2","3.2.0","3.2.1","3.3.0","3.3.1","3.4.0","3.5.0","3.5.1","3.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/07/GHSA-c8rp-cgf4-937w/GHSA-c8rp-cgf4-937w.json"}},{"package":{"name":"mezzio/mezzio-swoole","ecosystem":"Packagist","purl":"pkg:composer/mezzio/mezzio-swoole"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"4.0.0"},{"fixed":"4.3.0"}]}],"versions":["4.0.0","4.1.0","4.1.1","4.2.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/07/GHSA-c8rp-cgf4-937w/GHSA-c8rp-cgf4-937w.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-swoole/security/advisories/GHSA-c8rp-cgf4-937w"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-swoole"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-07-29T22:26:10Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-08T12:30:15.960308Z","source":"packagist","ecosystem":"Packagist"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-f6p5-76fp-m248","published":"2022-04-28T21:09:54Z","modified":"2024-11-28T05:40:52.931974Z","summary":"URL Rewrite vulnerability in multiple zendframework components","details":"zend-diactoros (and, by extension, Expressive), zend-http (and, by extension, Zend Framework MVC projects), and zend-feed (specifically, its PubSubHubbub sub-component) each contain a potential URL rewrite exploit.

Through these vulnerabilities, an attacker could tamper with page rendering, redirect victims to a fake login page, or capture user credentials (such as cookies). With the potential backdoor upload an attacker could gain access to the server itself, to an extent mainly limited by the server setup.\n\n### Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (SXSS) with authentication\nA Neos backend user with permission to modify content can insert JavaScript instructions into content elements. The browser will execute the script in \"Print\" preview mode.\nA Neos backend user who can modify his profile information (\"Title\", \"First Name\", \"Last name\", \"Middle Name\", \"Other Name\") can inject JavaScript instructions in those parameters. Once set up, an administrator who wants to edit this user account will execute the code.\nBoth attack vectors require a valid Neos backend user account.\n\n### Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS) without authentication\nA non-persistent XSS using parameters passed during plugin execution is possible.
