The slow response was due to locked ownership of some of the affected packages, which caused delays to update packages prior to disclosure.\n\nThe vulnerability is determined to be low severity.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability impacts users who rely on the for last digits of personnummer to be a _real_ personnummer.  \n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue have been patched in all repositories. The following versions should be updated to as soon as possible:\n\n[C#](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qv8q-v995-72gr) 3.0.2  \nD 3.0.1  \n[Dart](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4xh4-v2pq-jvhm) 3.0.3  \nElixir 3.0.0  \n[Go](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hv53-vf5m-8q94) 3.0.1  \n[Java](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q3vw-4jx3-rrr2) 3.3.0  \n[JavaScript](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vpgc-7h78-gx8f) 3.1.0  \nKotlin 1.1.0  \nLua 3.0.1  \n[PHP](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2p6g-gjp8-ggg9) 3.0.2  \nPerl 3.0.0  \n[Python](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxq3-5249-8hgg) 3.0.2  \n[Ruby](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vp9c-fpxx-744v) 3.0.1  \n[Rust](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-28r9-pq4c-wp3c) 3.0.0  \nScala 3.0.1  \nSwift 1.0.1  \n\nIf you are using any of the earlier packages, please update to latest.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe issue arrieses from the regular expression allowing the first three digits in the last four digits of the personnummer to be\n000, which is invalid. To mitigate this without upgrading, a check on the last four digits can be made to make sure it's not\n000x.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Personnummer Meta](https://github.com/personnummer/meta/issues)\n* Email us at [Personnummer Email](mailto:security@personnummer.dev)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"personnummer","ecosystem":"Pub","purl":"pkg:pub/personnummer"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"3.0.3"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","2.0.0","2.1.0","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/09/GHSA-4xh4-v2pq-jvhm/GHSA-4xh4-v2pq-jvhm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/personnummer/dart/security/advisories/GHSA-4xh4-v2pq-jvhm"},{"type":"ADVISORY","url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22963"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/personnummer/dart"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/personnummer"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-20"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-09-19T22:47:29Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"LOW"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-17T12:31:14.344534Z","source":"pub","ecosystem":"Pub"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-5844-q3fc-56rh","published":"2023-12-06T06:30:20Z","modified":"2025-07-22T16:04:41.150432Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-26154","GO-2023-2385"],"summary":"pubnub Insufficient Entropy vulnerability","details":"Versions of the package pubnub before 7.4.0; all versions of the package com.pubnub:pubnub; versions of the package pubnub before 6.19.0; all versions of the package github.com/pubnub/go; versions of the package github.com/pubnub/go/v7 before 7.2.0; versions of the package pubnub before 7.3.0; versions of the package pubnub/pubnub before 6.1.0; versions of the package pubnub before 5.3.0; versions of the package pubnub before 0.4.0; versions of the package pubnub/c-core before 4.5.0; versions of the package com.pubnub:pubnub-kotlin before 7.7.0; versions of the package pubnub/swift before 6.2.0; versions of the package pubnub before 5.2.0; versions of the package pubnub before 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Insufficient Entropy via the getKey function, due to inefficient implementation of the AES-256-CBC cryptographic algorithm.

No changes are required from the developer to start storing passwords using the safer algorithm.\n\n### Why did we change how passwords are stored?\nAn issue was identified with the old password hash algorithm that made it susceptible to rainbow attacks if the database was compromised.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to migrate your existing password hashes.\n\n### Migrate existing password hashes\nThe email authentication module provides a helper method to migrate all the existing legacy password hashes in the database. Simply call  `Emails.migrateLegacyPasswordHashes(...)` with a session instance as an argument to migrate the password hashes.\n\nThe method is implemented as an idempotent operation and will yield the same result regardless of how many times it is called.\n\nWe recommend either implementing a web server route that can be called remotely or by calling the method as part of starting the server.\n\nFollowing is example code for implementing a web server route.\n\n<details><summary><h4>Web server route code</h4></summary>\n\n```dart\nimport 'dart:io';\n\nimport 'package:serverpod/serverpod.dart';\nimport 'package:serverpod_auth_server/module.dart' as auth;\n\nclass MigratePasswordsRoute extends Route {\n  @override\n  Future<bool> handleCall(Session session, HttpRequest request) async {\n    request.response.writeln(\n      'Migrating legacy passwords, check the server logs for progress updates.',\n    );\n    _migratePasswords(session);\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n\nFuture<void> _migratePasswords(Session session) async {\n  session.log('Starting to migrate passwords.');\n\n  var totalMigratedPasswords = 0;\n  while (true) {\n    try {\n      var entriesMigrated = await auth.Emails.migrateLegacyPasswordHashes(\n        session,\n        // Process 100 database entries at a time\n        batchSize: 100,\n        // Stop after 500 entries have been migrated\n        maxMigratedEntries: 500,\n      );\n\n      totalMigratedPasswords += entriesMigrated;\n      session.log(\n        'Migrated $entriesMigrated password entries, total $totalMigratedPasswords.',\n      );\n\n      if (entriesMigrated == 0) break;\n\n      // Delay to avoid overloading the database\n      await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));\n    } catch (e) {\n      session.log('Error migrating passwords: $e');\n    }\n  }\n\n  session.log('Finished migrating passwords.');\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### How we migrate existing password hashes\nSince password hashes can’t be recalculated without knowledge of the plain text password, the method in the email authentication module applies the new algorithm to the already stored password hashes.\n\nWhen the affected users later authenticate, their password hash will be calculated using both algorithms in tandem. If the authentication is accepted, the stored password hash will be updated to only use the new algorithm so that further authentication only needs to run the new algorithm.\n\n### Impact\nAll versions of `serverpod_auth_server` pre `1.2.6`\n\n### Patches\nUpgrading to version `1.2.6` resolves this
