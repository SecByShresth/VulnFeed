An application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files). This vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.\n\nNote that Ibis itself makes **extremely limited** use of `pyarrow.parquet.read_table`:\n\n1. `read_table` is used in tests, where the input file is entirely controlled by the Ibis developers\n2. `read_table` is used in the `ibis/examples/__init__.py` as a fallback for backends that don't support reading Parquet directly. Parquet data used in `ibis.examples` are also managed by the Ibis developers. This Parquet data is generated from CSV files and SQLite databases.\n3. The Pandas and Dask backends both use PyArrow to read Parquet files and are therefore affected.\n\nIbis **does not** make use of APIs that directly read from either Arrow IPC files or Feather files.\n\n### Patches\n\nIbis imports the `pyarrow_hotfix` package wherever pyarrow is used, as of version 7.1.0.\n\nUpgrading to Arrow 14.0.1 is also a possible solution, starting in Ibis 7.1.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInstall [`pyarrow_hotfix`](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/) and run `import pyarrow_hotfix` ahead of any and all `import ibis` statements.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport ibis\n```\n\nbecomes\n\n```python\nimport pyarrow_hotfix\nimport ibis\n```\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-47248\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47248","affected":[{"package":{"name":"ibis-framework","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/ibis-framework"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"7.1.0"}]}],"versions":["0.10.0","0.11.1","0.11.2","0.12.0","0.13.0","0.14.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.5.1","0.5.2","0.6.1","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.9.0","1.0.0","1.1.0","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.4.0","2.0.0","2.1.0","2.1.1","3.0.0","3.0.1","3.0.2","3.1.0","3.2.0","4.0.0","4.1.0","5.0.0","5.1.0","5.1.1.dev467","5.1.1.dev516","5.1.1.dev554","5.1.1.dev596","6.0.0","6.0.1.dev128","6.0.1.dev33","6.0.1.dev58","6.1.0","6.1.1.dev135","6.1.1.dev176","6.1.1.dev22","6.1.1.dev96","6.2.0","7.0.0","7.0.0.dev230","7.0.0.dev439","7.0.0.dev501","7.0.0.dev525","7.0.0.dev627","v0.6.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/11/GHSA-x563-6hqv-26mr/GHSA-x563-6hqv-26mr.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/security/advisories/GHSA-x563-6hqv-26mr"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/commit/0fa1e5dc06783c01e912e8de4d7e10186ca0e364"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/releases/tag/7.1.0"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-502"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-11-17T21:47:11Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"CRITICAL"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-21T12:27:14.760204Z","source":"pypi","ecosystem":"PyPI"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-83fm-w79m-64r5","published":"2023-05-01T13:43:58Z","modified":"2024-11-28T05:40:42.701104Z","summary":"Remote file access vulnerability in `mlflow server` and `mlflow ui` CLIs","details":"### Impact\n\nUsers of the MLflow Open Source Project who are hosting the MLflow Model Registry using the ``mlflow server`` or ``mlflow ui`` commands using an MLflow version older than **MLflow 2.3.1** may be vulnerable to a remote file access exploit if they are not limiting who can query their server (for example, by using a cloud VPC, an IP allowlist for inbound requests, or authentication / authorization middleware).\n\nThis issue only affects users and integrations that run the ``mlflow server`` and ``mlflow ui`` commands.

additional protections on front-end servers, those that follow RFC7230 correctly would drop the request with a 400 Bad Request.\n\nWaitress will now correctly responds to the request with a 400 Bad Request, and will drop the connection to avoid any potential HTTP pipelining issues.\n\n### References\n\nThis was mentioned in https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-what-happened-next and was specifically mentioned as being an issue in HAProxy which did not properly filter it in this article: https://nathandavison.com/blog/haproxy-http-request-smuggling\n\n### Thanks\n\nThe Pylons Project would like to thank ZeddYu Lu for doing extended testing against Waitress 1.4.0 and bringing this to our attention!\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about

vulnerable to unsafe YAML deserialization","details":"### Impact\n\nA potential unsafe deserialization issue exists within the `autogluon.multimodal` module, where YAML files are loaded via `yaml.load()` instead of `yaml.safe_load()`. The deserialization of untrusted data may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, and impact to both confidentiality and integrity.\n\nImpacted versions: `>=0.4.0;<0.4.3`, `>=0.5.0;<0.5.2`.\n\n### Patches\nThe patches are included in `autogluon.multimodal==0.4.3`, `autogluon.multimodal==0.5.2` and Deep Learning Containers `0.4.3` and `0.5.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not load data which originated from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with. **Only load data you trust.**\n\n### References\n*

The version of OpenSSL included in sgx-dcap-quote-verify-python 0.0.1..0.0.2 is vulnerable to a security issue. More details about the OpenSSL vulnerabilities themselves can be found at https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt.\n\n## Analysis\nThe binding includes OpenSSL version 1.1.1s which is vulnerable to the vulnerabilities disclosed in [OpenSSL Security Advisory from the 7th February 2023](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt).\nThe binding does not directly use OpenSSL. The binding calls the SGX Quote Verification Library which uses OpenSSL.\n\n## Explanation\nThe SGX Quote Verification Library uses OpenSSL as a dependency to perform its cryptographic operations and certificate verification.\n\nThe OpenSSL security advisory mentions multiple vulnerabilities but I believe the most concerning would be CVE-2023-0286 “X.400 address type confusion in X.509 GeneralName”. Its severity is rated high and the advisory states that “this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.”\n\nRelying on CRLs obtained from an untrusted party is exactly what can happen when verifying a quote. For instance, the vulnerability could be triggered through the \"sgx_qv_verify_quote\" function which can take untrusted quote collateral as input. The quote collateral contains a CRL and certificate chains. The Quote Verification Library uses OpenSSL to verify the validity of those in order to establish the authenticity of the quote. Thus the vulnerability could be exploited with corrupted/forged collateral and quote.\n\n## Impact\n\nAccording to the advisory the \"vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service\". Transitively I expect the same to be true for the Quote Verification Library.\nThe denial of service impact is not much of a concern I believe since processing forged collateral would most likely stop the software from proceeding normally anyway (forged collateral should be rejected). The part regarding the ability to read memory contents, could result in information disclosure which is a real concern. The quote verification happens on the relying party end, which might use it to check enclave authenticity before providing sensitive data, this vulnerability could therefore result in the leakage of sensitive data.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"sgx-dcap-quote-verify-python","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/sgx-dcap-quote-verify-python"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.0.3"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/02/GHSA-344m-qcjq-xgrf/GHSA-344m-qcjq-xgrf.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/mithril-security/sgx-dcap-quote-verify-python/security/advisories/GHSA-344m-qcjq-xgrf"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/mithril-security/sgx-dcap-quote-verify-python"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-02-14T00:30:22Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-21T12:27:14.520707Z","source":"pypi","ecosystem":"PyPI"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-wvhx-q427-fgh3","published":"2024-05-06T14:33:32Z","modified":"2024-11-30T05:29:11.536447Z","aliases":["CVE-2024-34078"],"related":["CVE-2024-34078"],"summary":"Arbitrary HTML present after sanitization because of unicode normalization","details":"### Impact\n\nIf using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end.

has a Use-After-Free Vulnerability","details":"## Summary\n\npycares is vulnerable to a use-after-free condition that occurs when a Channel object is garbage collected while DNS queries are still pending. This results in a fatal Python error and interpreter crash.\n\n## Details\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper handling of callback references when the Channel object is destroyed:\n\n1. When a DNS query is initiated, pycares stores a callback reference using `ffi.new_handle()`\n2. If the Channel object is garbage collected while queries are pending, the callback references become invalid\n3. When c-ares attempts to invoke the callback, it accesses freed memory, causing a fatal error\n\nThis issue was much more likely to occur when using `event_thread=True` but could happen without it under the right circumstances.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe core issue is a race condition between Python's garbage collector and c-ares's callback execution:\n\n1. When `__del__` is called from within a c-ares callback context, we cannot immediately call `ares_destroy()` because c-ares is still executing code after the callback returns\n2. c-ares needs to execute cleanup code after our Python callback returns (specifically at lines 1422-1429 in ares_process.c)\n3. If we destroy the channel too quickly, c-ares accesses freed memory\n\n### Impact\n\nApplications using `pycares` can be crashed remotely by triggering DNS queries that result in `Channel` objects being garbage collected before query completion. This is particularly problematic in scenarios where:\n\n- Channel objects are created per-request\n- Multiple failed DNS queries are processed rapidly\n- The application doesn't properly manage Channel lifecycle\n\nThe error manifests as:\n```\nFatal Python error: b_from_handle: ffi.from_handle() detected that the address passed points to garbage\n```\n\n## Fix\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in pycares 4.9.0 by implementing a safe channel destruction mechanism\n\n## Mitigation\n\n### For Application Developers\n\n1. **Upgrade to pycares >= 4.9.0** - This version includes the fix and requires no code changes\n2. **Best practices** (optional but recommended):\n   ```python\n   # Explicit cleanup\n   channel.close()\n   \n   # Or use context manager\n   with pycares.Channel() as channel:\n       # ... use channel ...\n   # Automatically closed\n   ```\n3. **Avoid creating Channel objects per-request** - Prefer long-lived instances for better performance and safety\n\nThe fix is completely transparent - no API changes or code modifications are required.\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by @vEpiphyte through the aio-libs security program.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pycares","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/pycares"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"4.9.0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.0","0.2.0","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.6.1","0.6.2","0.6.3","0.7.0","1.0.0","2.0.0","2.0.1","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.2.0","2.3.0","2.4.0","3.0.0","3.0.0b0","3.0.0b1","3.0.0b2","3.0.0b3","3.0.0b4","3.0.0b5","3.1.0","3.1.1","3.2.0","3.2.3","4.0.0","4.1.1","4.1.2","4.2.0","4.2.1","4.2.2","4.3.0","4.4.0","4.5.0","4.6.0","4.6.1","4.7.0","4.8.0"],"database_specific":{"last_known_affected_version_range":"<= 4.8.0","source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2025/06/GHSA-5qpg-rh4j-qp35/GHSA-5qpg-rh4j-qp35.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/saghul/pycares/security/advisories/GHSA-5qpg-rh4j-qp35"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/saghul/pycares/commit/ebfd7d71eb8e74bc1057a361ea79a5906db510d4"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/saghul/pycares"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2025-06-16T16:09:47Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-21T12:27:14.556290Z","source":"pypi","ecosystem":"PyPI"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q77w-mwjj-7mqx","published":"2025-08-26T21:40:04Z","modified":"2025-08-26T21:58:35.357756Z","summary":"Picklescan is missing detection when calling built-in python library asyncio.unix_events._UnixSubprocessTransport._start","details":"### Summary\n\nUsing asyncio.unix_events._UnixSubprocessTransport._start function, which is a built-in python library function to execute remote pickle file.\n\n### Details\n\nThe attack payload executes in the following steps:\n\nFirst, the attacker craft the payload by calling to asyncio.unix_events._UnixSubprocessTransport._start function in reduce method\nThen when the victim after checking whether the pickle file is safe by using Picklescan library and this library doesn't dectect any dangerous functions, decide to pickle.load() this malicious pickle file, thus lead to remote code execution.\n\n### PoC\n\n```\nfrom asyncio.unix_events import _UnixSubprocessTransport\nfrom types import SimpleNamespace\n\nclass EvilAsyncioUnixSubprocessTransportStart:\n    def __reduce__(self):\n        fake_self = SimpleNamespace(\n            _loop=None,\n            _protocol=None,\n            _proc=None\n        )\n        args = \"whoami\"  \n        return _UnixSubprocessTransport._start, (\n            fake_self, args, True, None, None, None, 0\n        )\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nWho is impacted?

But it makes the application vulnerable to:\n\n- [Billion Laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack): It is a type of denial-of-service attack aimed at XML parsers. It uses multiple levels of nested entities. If one large entity is repeated with a couple of thousand chars repeatedly, the parser gets overwhelmed.  \n- [Quadratic blowup attack](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/xml-quadratic-blowup-denial-of-service-attack/): It is similar to a Billion Laughs attack. It abuses entity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities, it repeats one large entity with a couple of thousand chars repeatedly.\n\nThe Problem has been patched starting from version `1.0.1` by utilising the `defusedxml` package instead of `xml.etree.ElementTree`.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor this vulnerability to be exploited the user must be using a custom API URL, which has to be manually given using the `api_url` argument, or MyOwnFreeHost's API must be hacked. So, if the user did not use a custom API URL they _should_ be fine, however, upgrading is still advised.\n\nAnother workaround could be to call `defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()` before making any requests using the client.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"mofh","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/mofh"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.0.1"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","1.0.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/08/GHSA-7r9x-qrpr-3cxw/GHSA-7r9x-qrpr-3cxw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Wallvon/mofh/security/advisories/GHSA-7r9x-qrpr-3cxw"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/Wallvon/mofh/commit/da0d33cfd368e2f237ab28bf7a7f00e3d281005a"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/Wallvon/mofh"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/xml-quadratic-blowup-denial-of-service-attack"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-611"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-08-11T18:06:05Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-21T12:27:14.582763Z","source":"pypi","ecosystem":"PyPI"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-q7mf-hp9m-cx6f","published":"2022-04-29T02:59:35Z","modified":"2024-12-03T06:07:05.788543Z","aliases":["CVE-2004-1444"],"summary":"Roundup

Verification of Cryptographic Signature in aws-encryption-sdk","details":"### Impact\n\nThis advisory addresses several LOW severity issues with streaming signed messages and restricting processing of certain types of invalid messages. \n\nThis ESDK supports a streaming mode where callers may stream the plaintext of signed messages before the ECDSA signature is validated. In addition to these signatures, the ESDK uses AES-GCM encryption and all plaintext is verified before being released to a caller. There is no impact on the integrity of the ciphertext or decrypted plaintext, however some callers may rely on the the ECDSA signature for non-repudiation. Without validating the ECDSA signature, an actor with trusted KMS permissions to decrypt a message may also be able to encrypt messages. This update introduces a new API for callers who wish to stream only unsigned messages. \n\nFor customers who process ESDK messages from untrusted sources, this update also introduces a new configuration to limit the number of Encrypted Data Keys (EDKs) that the ESDK will attempt to process per message. This configuration provides customers with a way to limit the number of AWS KMS Decrypt API calls that the ESDK will make per message. This setting will reject messages with more EDKs than the configured limit.\n\nFinally, this update adds early rejection of invalid messages with certain invalid combinations of algorithm suite and header data.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in versions 1.9 and 2.2. We recommend that all users upgrade to address these issues.\n\nCustomers leveraging the ESDK’s streaming features have several options to protect signature validation. One is to ensure that client code reads to the end of the stream before using released plaintext.

However it is possible to have applications that both sign and validate tokens and do not separate JWKs in use, or do not set a JWK 'use' type.\n\nDue to the mitigating factors, and the fact that specific operational constraints and conditions need to be in place to successfully exploit this issue to generate an authentication bypass, we rate this security issue as moderate.

In addition to these signatures, the ESDK uses AES-GCM encryption and all plaintext is verified before being released to a caller. There is no impact on the integrity of the ciphertext or decrypted plaintext, however some callers may rely on the the ECDSA signature for non-repudiation. Without validating the ECDSA signature, an actor with trusted KMS permissions to decrypt a message may also be able to encrypt messages. This update introduces a new API for callers who wish to stream only unsigned messages. \n\nFor customers who process ESDK messages from untrusted sources, this update also introduces a new configuration to limit the number of Encrypted Data Keys (EDKs) that the ESDK will attempt to process per message. This configuration provides customers with a way to limit the number of AWS KMS Decrypt API calls that the ESDK will make per message. This setting will reject messages with more EDKs than the configured limit.\n\nFinally, this update adds early rejection of invalid messages with certain invalid combinations of algorithm suite and header data.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in versions 1.9 and 2.2. We recommend that all users upgrade to address these issues.\n\nCustomers leveraging the ESDK’s streaming features have several options to protect signature validation. One is to ensure that client code reads to the end of the stream before using released plaintext. With this release, using the new API for streaming and falling back to the non-streaming decrypt API for signed messages prevents using any plaintext from signed data before the signature is validated.

PGP trust model not (fully) considered","details":"### Impact\n\nThis security advisory lists multiple concerns about how in-toto uses PGP keys. The findings are aggregated here, because they are all eligible to the same mitigation strategy. Note that the findings are rated with different severities (see inline) and the highest score was chosen for this advisory:\n\n- **PGP Key Creation Time Not Validated** (severity: low)\n  in-toto does not check, if the validity period of a PGP Key (starting with the key creation time) is in the future, when copying the key from GnuPG to a layout, or when verifying signatures. A validity period in the future is usually a sign of a wrong system clock, meaning it can’t be trusted for verifying the validity period. A MITM attacker who is able to manipulate delivered software products might also be able to control the system time by manipulating NTP. In a scenario where an attacker gained control over two expired subkeys with no overlapping validity period, the attacker could set the system time to a time before the validity period of either key, resulting in both keys being accepted.\n\n- **PGP Key Revocation Not Considered** (severity: medium)\n in-toto does not check PGP revocation signatures, when copying the key from GnuPG to a layout, or when verifying signatures. This means that a key may still be accepted in signatures, even if it has been revoked in GnuPG.\n\n- **PGP Key Usage Flags Not Considered** (severity: low)\n  in-toto does not check PGP usage flags, when copying the key from GnuPG to a layout, or when verifying signatures. This means that at a key may still be accepted in signatures, even if it is not permitted to sign data as per its key usage flags.\n\n\nSecurity auditors recommend to verify these properties at signature verification time.\n\nHowever, this is not planned, as in-toto does not rely on PGP’s trust model, because it should not be required to consult with a separate PKI/web-of-trust at verification time. Instead the project owner establishes ultimate trust by adding a PGP public key to a layout, and thus is responsible for its validity, and also to revoke the layout, if the key is no longer trusted. The same is true for PGP public keys used to verify a layout.\n\nThe preferred mitigation strategy is to verify these properties when exporting a public key from GnuPG, and to clarify usage documentation that no verification against the PGP trust model is performed afterwards.\n\n### References\n- \"Handle GPG revocation signatures\" -- https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/190\n- \"inconsistent use of GnuPG\" -- https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/issues/569\n\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"in-toto","ecosystem":"PyPI","purl":"pkg:pypi/in-toto"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"last_affected":"1.4.0"}]}],"versions":["0.1.1","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.2.2","0.2.3","0.2.3.dev2","0.2.3.dev3","0.2.3.dev4","0.2.3.dev5","0.2.dev3","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.4.1","0.4.2","0.5.0","1.0.0","1.0.1","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.2.0","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/05/GHSA-jjgp-whrp-gq8m/GHSA-jjgp-whrp-gq8m.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/security/advisories/GHSA-jjgp-whrp-gq8m"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/issues/569"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/190"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-295"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-05-11T20:48:15Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2025-12-21T12:27:14.672333Z","source":"pypi","ecosystem":"PyPI"}}]
