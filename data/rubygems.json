This issue can result in memory corruption or a denial of service when processing crafted input.\n\nNVD claims a severity of 7.5 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)\n\nFixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/17d950ae\n\n### CVE-2025-6170\n\nA flaw was found in the interactive shell of the xmllint command-line tool, used for parsing XML files. When a user inputs an overly long command, the program does not check the input size properly, which can cause it to crash. This issue might allow attackers to run harmful code in rare configurations without modern protections.\n\nNVD claims a severity of 2.5 Low (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)\n\nFixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/5e9ec5c1\n\n### CVE-2025-49794\n\nA use-after-free vulnerability was found in libxml2. This issue occurs when parsing XPath elements under certain circumstances when the XML schematron has the <sch:name path=\"...\"/> schema elements. This flaw allows a malicious actor to craft a malicious XML document used as input for libxml, resulting in the program's crash using libxml or other possible undefined behaviors.\n\nNVD claims a severity of 9.1 Critical (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)\n\nFixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/81cef8c5\n\n### CVE-2025-49795\n\nA NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in libxml2 when processing XPath XML expressions. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious XML input to libxml2, leading to a denial of service.\n\nNVD claims a severity of 7.5 High (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)\n\nFixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/62048278\n\n### CVE-2025-49796\n\nA vulnerability was found in libxml2. Processing certain sch:name elements from the input XML file can trigger a memory corruption issue. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious XML input file that can lead libxml to crash, resulting in a denial of service or other possible undefined behavior due to sensitive data being corrupted in memory.\n\nNVD claims a severity of 9.1 Critical (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)\n\nFixed by applying https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/81cef8c5\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Nokogiri < 1.18.9 when using CRuby (MRI) with vendored libxml2\n\n## Patched Versions\n\n- Nokogiri >= 1.18.9\n\n## Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri v1.18.9 or later.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against patched external libxml2 libraries which will also address these same issues.\n\n##

Advisory: Camaleon CMS vulnerable to remote code execution through code injection (GHSL-2024-185)","details":"# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-7x4w-cj9r-h4v9. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\nThe [actions](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L51-L52) defined inside of the MediaController class do not check whether a given path is inside a certain path (e.g. inside the media folder). If an attacker performed an account takeover of an administrator account (See: GHSL-2024-184) they could delete arbitrary files or folders on the server hosting Camaleon CMS. The [crop_url](https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/blob/feccb96e542319ed608acd3a16fa5d92f13ede67/app/controllers/camaleon_cms/admin/media_controller.rb#L64-L65) action might make arbitrary file writes (similar impact to GHSL-2024-182) for any authenticated user possible, but it doesn't seem to work currently.\n\nArbitrary file deletion can be exploited with following code path:\nThe parameter folder flows from the actions method:\n```ruby\n  def actions\n    authorize! :manage, :media if params[:media_action] != 'crop_url'\n    params[:folder] = params[:folder].gsub('//', '/') if params[:folder].present?\n    case params[:media_action]\n    [..]\n    when 'del_file'\n      cama_uploader.delete_file(params[:folder].gsub('//', '/'))\n      render plain: ''\n```\ninto the method delete_file of the CamaleonCmsLocalUploader\nclass (when files are uploaded locally):\n```ruby\ndef delete_file(key)\n  file = File.join(@root_folder, key)\n  FileUtils.rm(file) if File.exist? file\n  @instance.hooks_run('after_delete', key)\n  get_media_collection.find_by_key(key).take.destroy\nend\n```\nWhere it is joined in an unchecked manner with the root folder and\nthen deleted.\n\n**Proof of concept**\nThe following request would delete the file README.md in the top folder of the Ruby on Rails application. (The values for auth_token, X-CSRF-Token and _cms_session would also need to be replaced with authenticated values in the curl command below)\n```\ncurl --path-as-is -i -s -k -X $'POST' \\\n    -H $'X-CSRF-Token: [..]' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8' -H $'Accept: */*' -H $'Connection: keep-alive' \\\n    -b $'auth_token=[..]; _cms_session=[..]' \\\n    --data-binary $'versions=&thumb_size=&formats=&media_formats=&dimension=&private=&folder=..\n2F..\n2F..\n2FREADME.md&media_action=del_file' \\\n    $'https://<camaleon-host>/admin/media/actions?actions=true'\n```\n\n**Impact**\n\nThis issue may lead to a defective CMS or system.\n\n**Remediation**\n\nNormalize all file paths constructed from untrusted user input before using them and check that the resulting path is inside the\ntargeted directory. Additionally, do not allow character sequences such as .. in untrusted input that is used to build paths.\n\n**See also:**\n\n[CodeQL: Uncontrolled data used in path expression](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/ruby/rb-path-injection/)\n[OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"camaleon_cms","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/camaleon_cms"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"2.8.1"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.1.2","0.1.3","0.1.4","0.1.5","0.1.6","0.1.7","0.1.8","0.1.9","0.2.0","0.2.1","1.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.0.8","1.0.9","1.1.0","2.0.1","2.0.2","2.0.3","2.0.4","2.0.4.1","2.1.0","2.1.1","2.1.1.4","2.1.2.0","2.1.2.1","2.2.0","2.2.1","2.3.0","2.3.1","2.3.2","2.3.3","2.3.4","2.3.5","2.3.6","2.3.7","2.3.7.1","2.3.7.2","2.4.0","2.4.1","2.4.2","2.4.3","2.4.3.1","2.4.3.10","2.4.3.11","2.4.3.12","2.4.3.13","2.4.3.2","2.4.3.3","2.4.3.4","2.4.3.5","2.4.3.6","2.4.3.7","2.4.3.8","2.4.3.9","2.4.4","2.4.4.1","2.4.4.2","2.4.4.3","2.4.4.4","2.4.4.5","2.4.4.6","2.4.4.7","2.4.5","2.4.5.1","2.4.5.10","2.4.5.11","2.4.5.12","2.4.5.13","2.4.5.14","2.4.5.2","2.4.5.3","2.4.5.4","2.4.5.5","2.4.5.7","2.4.5.8","2.4.5.9","2.4.6.0","2.4.6.1","2.4.6.2","2.4.6.3","2.4.6.4","2.4.6.5","2.4.6.6","2.4.6.7","2.4.6.8","2.4.6.9","2.5.0","2.5.1","2.5.2","2.5.3","2.5.3.1","2.6.0","2.6.0.1","2.6.1","2.6.2","2.6.3","2.6.4","2.7.0","2.7.1","2.7.2","2.7.3","2.7.4","2.7.5","2.8.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2024/09/GHSA-3hp8-6j24-m5gm/GHSA-3hp8-6j24-m5gm.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-7x4w-cj9r-h4v9"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/owen2345/camaleon-cms"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/camaleon_cms/GHSA-7x4w-cj9r-h4v9.yml"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2024-09-23T22:05:58Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T18:23:05.879185Z","source":"rubygems","ecosystem":"RubyGems"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-pcqq-5962-hvcw","published":"2020-03-10T18:02:49Z","modified":"2025-05-22T17:55:09.602571Z","summary":"Denial of Service in uap-core when processing crafted User-Agent strings","details":"### Impact\nSome regexes are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture groups.

While the `Entity` dropdown select field is greyed out in the UI, an attacker can use tools which allow sending arbitrary HTTP request to craft a request to the `/admin/users/{user_id}/memberships/{membership_id}` endpoint containing an additional `membership[entity_id]` parameter. This parameter is honored when the membership is updated, allowing an attacker to update the membership object associated with their own account (with `manager` role) to be associated with a different attacker-chosen account instead. Since `account_id`s are enumerable, an attacker can compromise all accounts present on the platform.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to version 15.7.1 or 14.5.2 of the `pageflow` gem.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at info(at)codevise.de \n\n### Credits\n\n[Positive Security](https://positive.security/)","affected":[{"package":{"name":"pageflow","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/pageflow"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"14.5.2"}]}],"versions":["0.0.1","0.0.2","0.0.3","0.0.4","0.0.5","0.1.0","0.10.0","0.11.0","0.11.1","0.11.2","0.11.3","0.11.4","0.2.0","0.2.1","0.3.0","0.4.0","0.5.0","0.6.0","0.7.0","0.7.1","0.7.2","0.8.0","0.8.1","0.8.2","0.9.0","0.9.1","0.9.2","12.0.0","12.0.0.rc1","12.0.0.rc2","12.0.0.rc3","12.0.0.rc4","12.0.0.rc5","12.0.0.rc6","12.0.0.rc7","12.0.1","12.0.2","12.0.3","12.0.4","12.1.0","12.2.0","12.3.0","12.4.0","12.4.1","12.5.0","12.6.0","13.0.0","13.0.0.beta1","13.0.0.beta2","13.0.0.beta3","13.0.0.beta4","13.0.0.beta5","13.0.0.beta6","13.0.0.beta7","13.0.0.rc1","13.1.0","13.2.0","13.3.0","13.4.0","13.5.0","13.6.0","14.0.0","14.0.0.beta1","14.0.0.beta2","14.0.0.beta3","14.0.0.rc1","14.0.0.rc2","14.1.0","14.1.1","14.2.0","14.2.1","14.3.0","14.4.0","14.5.0","14.5.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/09/GHSA-qcqv-38jg-2r43/GHSA-qcqv-38jg-2r43.json"}},{"package":{"name":"pageflow","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/pageflow"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"15.0.0"},{"fixed":"15.7.1"}]}],"versions":["15.0.0","15.0.1","15.0.2","15.1.0","15.1.0.beta1","15.1.0.beta2","15.1.0.beta3","15.1.0.beta4","15.1.0.beta5","15.1.0.beta6","15.1.0.rc0","15.1.1","15.1.2","15.2.0","15.2.1","15.2.2","15.3.0","15.4.0","15.5.0","15.6.0","15.6.1","15.7.0"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/09/GHSA-qcqv-38jg-2r43/GHSA-qcqv-38jg-2r43.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/security/advisories/GHSA-qcqv-38jg-2r43"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/1862"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/codevise/pageflow"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-09-15T03:21:41Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T18:23:05.916624Z","source":"rubygems","ecosystem":"RubyGems"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-fq42-c5rg-92c2","published":"2022-02-25T20:32:09Z","modified":"2024-12-05T05:48:25.187357Z","summary":"Vulnerable dependencies in Nokogiri","details":"### Summary\n\nNokogiri [v1.13.2](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/releases/tag/v1.13.2) upgrades two of its packaged dependencies:\n\n- vendored libxml2 from v2.9.12 to [v2.9.13](https://download.gnome.org/sources/libxml2/2.9/libxml2-2.9.13.news)\n- vendored libxslt from v1.1.34 to [v1.1.35](https://download.gnome.org/sources/libxslt/1.1/libxslt-1.1.35.news)\n\nThose library versions address the following upstream CVEs:\n\n- libxslt: [CVE-2021-30560](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30560) (CVSS 8.8, High severity)\n- libxml2: [CVE-2022-23308](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23308) (Unspecified severity, see more information below)\n\nThose library versions also address numerous other issues including performance improvements, regression fixes, and bug fixes, as well as memory leaks and other use-after-free issues that were not assigned CVEs.\n\nPlease note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `< 1.13.2`, and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` and `libxslt` release announcements.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.2`.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link an older version Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2 `>= 2.9.13` and libxslt `>= 1.1.35`, which will also address these same CVEs.\n\n\n### Impact\n\n#### libxslt [CVE-2021-30560](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30560)\n\n- CVSS3 score: 8.8 (High)\n- Fixed by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/-/commit/50f9c9c\n\nAll versions of libxslt prior to v1.1.35 are affected.\n\nApplications using **untrusted** XSL stylesheets to transform XML are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack and should be upgraded immediately.\n\n\n#### libxml2 [CVE-2022-23308](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23308)\n\n- As of the time this security advisory was published, there is no officially published information available about this CVE's severity. The above NIST link does not yet have a published record, and the libxml2 maintainer has declined to provide a severity score.\n- Fixed by https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/652dd12\n- Further explanation is at https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2022-February/msg00015.html\n\nThe upstream commit and the explanation linked above indicate that an application may be vulnerable to a denial of service, memory disclosure, or code execution if it parses an **untrusted** document with parse options `DTDVALID` set to true, and `NOENT` set to false.\n\nAn analysis of these parse options:\n\n- While `NOENT` is off by default for Document, DocumentFragment, Reader, and Schema parsing, it is on by default for XSLT (stylesheet) parsing in Nokogiri v1.12.0 and later.\n- `DTDVALID` is an option that Nokogiri does not set for any operations, and so this CVE applies only to applications setting this option explicitly.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that any application explicitly setting the parse option `DTDVALID` when parsing **untrusted** documents is vulnerable and should be upgraded immediately.\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nokogiri","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/nokogiri"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.2"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.10.0","1.10.0.rc1","1.10.1","1.10.10","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.10.8","1.10.9","1.11.0","1.11.0.rc1","1.11.0.rc2","1.11.0.rc3","1.11.0.rc4","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.11.5","1.11.6","1.11.7","1.12.0","1.12.0.rc1","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.12.3","1.12.4","1.12.5","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.2.1","1.4.3","1.4.3.1","1.4.4","1.4.4.1","1.4.4.2","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.5.0","1.5.0.beta.1","1.5.0.beta.2","1.5.0.beta.3","1.5.0.beta.4","1.5.1","1.5.1.rc1","1.5.10","1.5.11","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.3.rc2","1.5.3.rc3","1.5.3.rc4","1.5.3.rc5","1.5.3.rc6","1.5.4","1.5.4.rc1","1.5.4.rc2","1.5.4.rc3","1.5.5","1.5.5.rc1","1.5.5.rc2","1.5.5.rc3","1.5.6","1.5.6.rc1","1.5.6.rc2","1.5.6.rc3","1.5.7","1.5.7.rc1","1.5.7.rc2","1.5.7.rc3","1.5.8","1.5.9","1.6.0","1.6.0.rc1","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.2.1","1.6.2.rc1","1.6.2.rc2","1.6.2.rc3","1.6.3","1.6.3.1","1.6.3.rc1","1.6.3.rc2","1.6.3.rc3","1.6.4","1.6.4.1","1.6.5","1.6.6.1","1.6.6.2","1.6.6.3","1.6.6.4","1.6.7","1.6.7.1","1.6.7.2","1.6.7.rc2","1.6.7.rc3","1.6.7.rc4","1.6.8","1.6.8.1","1.6.8.rc1","1.6.8.rc2","1.6.8.rc3","1.7.0","1.7.0.1","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.9.0","1.9.0.rc1","1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/02/GHSA-fq42-c5rg-92c2/GHSA-fq42-c5rg-92c2.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-fq42-c5rg-92c2"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":["CWE-416"],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-02-25T20:32:09Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"HIGH"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T18:23:05.901642Z","source":"rubygems","ecosystem":"RubyGems"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-x457-cw4h-hq5f","published":"2017-10-24T18:33:37Z","modified":"2024-12-05T05:39:59.197079Z","aliases":["CVE-2013-0269"],"summary":"JSON

vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting","details":"There is an XSS vulnerability in the `number_to_currency`, `number_to_percentage` and `number_to_human` helpers in Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0081.\n\nVersions Affected:  All.\nFixed Versions:     4.1.0.beta2, 4.0.3, 3.2.17.\n\nImpact\n------\nThese helpers allows users to nicely format a numeric value. Some of the parameters to the helper (format, negative_format and units) are not escaped correctly. Applications which pass user controlled data as one of these parameters are vulnerable to an XSS attack.\n\nAll users passing user controlled data to these parameters of the number helpers should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe 4.1.0.rc1, 4.0.3 and 3.2.17 releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\n\nThe workaround for this issue is to escape the value passed to the parameter.\nFor example, replace code like this:\n\n```ruby\n<%= number_to_currency(1.02, format: params[:format]) %>\n```\n\nWith code like this\n\n```ruby\n<%= number_to_currency(1.02, format: h(params[:format])) %>\n```\n\nPatches\n-------\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n* 4-1-beta-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 4.1-beta series\n* 4-0-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 4.0 series\n* 3-2-number_helpers_xss.patch - Patch for 3.2 series\n\nPlease note that only the 4.0.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.

[v2.10.4](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.10.4) from v2.10.3.\n\nlibxml2 v2.10.4 addresses the following known vulnerabilities:\n\n- [CVE-2023-29469](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-29469): Hashing of empty dict strings isn't deterministic\n-

xmlSchemaCheckCOSSTDerivedOK\n\nPlease note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `< 1.14.3`, and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.14.3`.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2 `>= 2.10.4` which will also address these same issues.\n\n\n### Impact\n\nNo public information has yet been published about the security-related issues other than the upstream commits. Examination of those changesets indicate that the more serious issues relate to libxml2 dereferencing NULL pointers and potentially segfaulting while parsing untrusted inputs.\n\nThe commits can be examined at:\n\n- [[CVE-2023-29469] Hashing of empty dict strings isn't deterministic (09a2dd45) · Commits · GNOME / libxml2 · GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/09a2dd453007f9c7205274623acdd73747c22d64)\n- [[CVE-2023-28484] Fix null deref in xmlSchemaFixupComplexType (647e072e) · Commits · GNOME / libxml2 · GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/647e072ea0a2f12687fa05c172f4c4713fdb0c4f)\n- [schemas: Fix null-pointer-deref in xmlSchemaCheckCOSSTDerivedOK (4c6922f7) · Commits · GNOME / libxml2 · GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/4c6922f763ad958c48ff66f82823ae21f2e92ee6)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nokogiri","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/nokogiri"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.14.3"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.10.0","1.10.0.rc1","1.10.1","1.10.10","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.10.8","1.10.9","1.11.0","1.11.0.rc1","1.11.0.rc2","1.11.0.rc3","1.11.0.rc4","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.11.5","1.11.6","1.11.7","1.12.0","1.12.0.rc1","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.12.3","1.12.4","1.12.5","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.13.10","1.13.2","1.13.3","1.13.4","1.13.5","1.13.6","1.13.7","1.13.8","1.13.9","1.14.0","1.14.0.rc1","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.2.1","1.4.3","1.4.3.1","1.4.4","1.4.4.1","1.4.4.2","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.5.0","1.5.0.beta.1","1.5.0.beta.2","1.5.0.beta.3","1.5.0.beta.4","1.5.1","1.5.1.rc1","1.5.10","1.5.11","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.3.rc2","1.5.3.rc3","1.5.3.rc4","1.5.3.rc5","1.5.3.rc6","1.5.4","1.5.4.rc1","1.5.4.rc2","1.5.4.rc3","1.5.5","1.5.5.rc1","1.5.5.rc2","1.5.5.rc3","1.5.6","1.5.6.rc1","1.5.6.rc2","1.5.6.rc3","1.5.7","1.5.7.rc1","1.5.7.rc2","1.5.7.rc3","1.5.8","1.5.9","1.6.0","1.6.0.rc1","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.2.1","1.6.2.rc1","1.6.2.rc2","1.6.2.rc3","1.6.3","1.6.3.1","1.6.3.rc1","1.6.3.rc2","1.6.3.rc3","1.6.4","1.6.4.1","1.6.5","1.6.6.1","1.6.6.2","1.6.6.3","1.6.6.4","1.6.7","1.6.7.1","1.6.7.2","1.6.7.rc2","1.6.7.rc3","1.6.7.rc4","1.6.8","1.6.8.1","1.6.8.rc1","1.6.8.rc2","1.6.8.rc3","1.7.0","1.7.0.1","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.9.0","1.9.0.rc1","1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/04/GHSA-pxvg-2qj5-37jq/GHSA-pxvg-2qj5-37jq.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-pxvg-2qj5-37jq"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28484"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-29469"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/09a2dd453007f9c7205274623acdd73747c22d64"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/4c6922f763ad958c48ff66f82823ae21f2e92ee6"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/647e072ea0a2f12687fa05c172f4c4713fdb0c4f"},{"type":"WEB","url":"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.10.4"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2023-04-11T21:48:01Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T18:23:05.915313Z","source":"rubygems","ecosystem":"RubyGems"}},{"schema_version":"1.7.3","id":"GHSA-c8v6-786g-vjx6","published":"2024-02-29T03:33:14Z","modified":"2024-12-04T05:57:53.402074Z","aliases":["CVE-2023-51774"],"related":["CGA-4f9p-qmmw-h6j2","CGA-g8cx-qv8p-fj93"],"summary":"json-jwt allows bypass of identity checks via a sign/encryption confusion attack","details":"The json-jwt (aka JSON::JWT) gem 1.16.x before 1.16.6, 1.15.x before 1.15.3.1 for Ruby sometimes allows bypass of identity checks via a sign/encryption confusion attack.

[v2.10.3](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases/v2.10.3) from v2.9.14.\n\nlibxml2 v2.10.3 addresses the following known vulnerabilities:\n\n- [CVE-2022-2309](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2309)\n- [CVE-2022-40304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40304)\n- [CVE-2022-40303](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40303)\n\nPlease note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `< 1.13.9`, and only if the _packaged_ libraries are being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use _system_ libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.9`.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade Nokogiri may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link Nokogiri against external libraries libxml2 `>= 2.10.3` which will also address these same issues.\n\n\n### Impact\n\n#### libxml2 [CVE-2022-2309](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2309)\n\n- **CVSS3 score**: Under evaluation\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.\n\nNokogiri maintainers investigated at #2620 and determined this CVE does not affect Nokogiri users.\n\n\n#### libxml2 [CVE-2022-40304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40304)\n\n- **CVSS3 score**: Unspecified upstream\n- **Type**: Data corruption, denial of service\n- **Description**: When an entity reference cycle is detected, the entity content is cleared by setting its first byte to zero. But the entity content might be allocated from a dict. In this case, the dict entry becomes corrupted leading to all kinds of logic errors, including memory errors like double-frees.\n\nSee https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/644a89e080bced793295f61f18aac8cfad6bece2\n\n\n#### libxml2 [CVE-2022-40303](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40303)\n\n- **CVSS3 score**: Unspecified upstream\n- **Type**: Integer overflow\n- **Description**: Integer overflows with XML_PARSE_HUGE\n\nSee https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/c846986356fc149915a74972bf198abc266bc2c0\n\n\n### References\n\n- [libxml2 release notes](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases)\n- [CVE-2022-2309](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2309)\n- [CVE-2022-40304](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40304)\n- [CVE-2022-40303](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-40303)\n","affected":[{"package":{"name":"nokogiri","ecosystem":"RubyGems","purl":"pkg:gem/nokogiri"},"ranges":[{"type":"ECOSYSTEM","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"1.13.9"}]}],"versions":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2","1.0.3","1.0.4","1.0.5","1.0.6","1.0.7","1.1.0","1.1.1","1.10.0","1.10.0.rc1","1.10.1","1.10.10","1.10.2","1.10.3","1.10.4","1.10.5","1.10.6","1.10.7","1.10.8","1.10.9","1.11.0","1.11.0.rc1","1.11.0.rc2","1.11.0.rc3","1.11.0.rc4","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.11.3","1.11.4","1.11.5","1.11.6","1.11.7","1.12.0","1.12.0.rc1","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.12.3","1.12.4","1.12.5","1.13.0","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.13.3","1.13.4","1.13.5","1.13.6","1.13.7","1.13.8","1.2.0","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.3.0","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.3.3","1.4.0","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.2.1","1.4.3","1.4.3.1","1.4.4","1.4.4.1","1.4.4.2","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.5.0","1.5.0.beta.1","1.5.0.beta.2","1.5.0.beta.3","1.5.0.beta.4","1.5.1","1.5.1.rc1","1.5.10","1.5.11","1.5.2","1.5.3","1.5.3.rc2","1.5.3.rc3","1.5.3.rc4","1.5.3.rc5","1.5.3.rc6","1.5.4","1.5.4.rc1","1.5.4.rc2","1.5.4.rc3","1.5.5","1.5.5.rc1","1.5.5.rc2","1.5.5.rc3","1.5.6","1.5.6.rc1","1.5.6.rc2","1.5.6.rc3","1.5.7","1.5.7.rc1","1.5.7.rc2","1.5.7.rc3","1.5.8","1.5.9","1.6.0","1.6.0.rc1","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.2.1","1.6.2.rc1","1.6.2.rc2","1.6.2.rc3","1.6.3","1.6.3.1","1.6.3.rc1","1.6.3.rc2","1.6.3.rc3","1.6.4","1.6.4.1","1.6.5","1.6.6.1","1.6.6.2","1.6.6.3","1.6.6.4","1.6.7","1.6.7.1","1.6.7.2","1.6.7.rc2","1.6.7.rc3","1.6.7.rc4","1.6.8","1.6.8.1","1.6.8.rc1","1.6.8.rc2","1.6.8.rc3","1.7.0","1.7.0.1","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.8.0","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.9.0","1.9.0.rc1","1.9.1"],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2022/10/GHSA-2qc6-mcvw-92cw/GHSA-2qc6-mcvw-92cw.json"}}],"references":[{"type":"WEB","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-2qc6-mcvw-92cw"},{"type":"PACKAGE","url":"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri"}],"database_specific":{"cwe_ids":[],"github_reviewed":true,"github_reviewed_at":"2022-10-18T18:12:31Z","nvd_published_at":null,"severity":"MODERATE"},"_metadata":{"fetched_at":"2026-01-16T18:23:05.877169Z","source":"rubygems","ecosystem":"RubyGems"}}]
